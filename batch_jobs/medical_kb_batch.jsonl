A transmitter sends high frequency sound waves into the body,\nwhere they bounce off the different tissues and organs\nto produce a distinctive pattern of echoes. A receiver\n\u2018\u2018hears\u2019\u2019 the returning echo pattern and forwards it to a\ncomputer, which translates the data into an image on a\ntelevision screen. Because ultrasound can distinguish\nsubtle variations between soft, fluid-filled tissues, it is\nparticularly useful in providing diagnostic images of the\nabdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment.\n\nPurpose\nThe potential medical applications of ultrasound\nwere first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of\nthe sonar technology developed to detect submarines\nduring World War II. The first useful medical images\nwere produced in the early 1950s, and, by 1965, ultrasound quality had improved to the point that it came\ninto general medical use. Improvements in the technology, application, and interpretation of ultrasound\ncontinue. Its low cost, versatility, safety and speed\nhave brought it into the top drawer of medical imaging\ntechniques.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\nWhile pelvic ultrasound is widely known and commonly used for fetal monitoring during pregnancy,\nultrasound is also routinely used for general abdominal imaging. It has great advantage over x-ray imaging technologies in that it does not damage tissues\nwith ionizing radiation. Ultrasound is also generally\nfar better than plain x rays at distinguishing the subtle\nvariations of soft tissue structures, and can be used in\nany of several modes, depending on the need at hand.\nAs an imaging tool, abdominal ultrasound generally is warranted for patients afflicted with: chronic or\nacute abdominal pain; abdominal trauma; an obvious\nor suspected abdominal mass; symptoms of liver disease, pancreatic disease, gallstones, spleen disease, kidney disease and urinary blockage; or symptoms of an\nabdominal aortic aneurysm.

Whether acute or chronic, pain can\nsignal a serious problem\u2013from organ malfunction or\ninjury to the presence of malignant growths.\nUltrasound scanning can help doctors quickly sort\nthrough potential causes when presented with general or ambiguous symptoms. All of the major\nabdominal organs can be studied for signs of disease\nthat appear as changes in size, shape and internal\nstructure.\n\n\u0002\n\nAbdominal trauma. After a serious accident, such as\na car crash or a fall, internal bleeding from injured\nabdominal organs is often the most serious threat to\nsurvival. Neither the injuries nor the bleeding are\nimmediately apparent. Ultrasound is very useful as\nan initial scan when abdominal trauma is suspected,\nand it can be used to pinpoint the location, cause,\nand severity of hemorrhaging. In the case of puncture wounds, from a bullet for example, ultrasound\ncan locate the foreign object and provide a preliminary survey of the damage. The easy portability and\nversatility of ultrasound technology has brought it\ninto common emergency room use, and even into\nlimited ambulance service.\n1\n\n\fAbdominal ultrasound\n\n\u0002\n\nAbdominal mass. Abnormal growths\u2013tumors, cysts,\nabscesses, scar tissue and accessory organs\u2013can be\nlocated and tentatively identified with ultrasound.

These calculi can\ncause painful inflammation of the gallbladder and\nalso obstruct the bile ducts that carry digestive enzymes\nfrom the gallbladder and liver to the intestines.\nGallstones are readily identifiable with ultrasound.\n\n\u0002\n\nSpleen disease. The spleen is particularly prone to\ninjury during abdominal trauma. It may also become\npainfully inflamed when beset with infection or\ncancer. These conditions also lend themselves well\nto ultrasonic inspection and diagnosis.\n\n\u0002\n\nKidney disease. The kidneys are also prone to traumatic injury and are the organs most likely to form\ncalculi, which can block the flow of urine and cause\nblood poisoning (uremia). A variety of diseases causing\ndistinct changes in kidney morphology can also lead to\ncomplete kidney failure. Ultrasound imaging has proven extremely useful in diagnosing kidney disorders.\n\n\u0002\n\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a bulging weak\nspot in the abdominal aorta, which supplies blood\ndirectly from the heart to the entire lower body.\nThese aneurysms are relatively common and increase\nin prevalence with age. A burst aortic aneurysm is\nimminently life-threatening. However, they can be\nreadily identified and monitored with ultrasound\nbefore acute complications result.\n\nUltrasound technology can also be used for treatment purposes, most frequently as a visual aid during\nsurgical procedures\u2013such as guiding needle placement\nto drain fluid from a cyst, or to extract tumor cells for\nbiopsy. Increasingly, direct therapeutic applications\nfor ultrasound are being developed.\n2\n\nThe direct therapeutic value of ultrasonic waves\nlies in their mechanical nature. They are shock waves,\njust like audible sound, and vibrate the materials\nthrough which they pass. These vibrations are mild,\nvirtually unnoticeable at the frequencies and intensities used for imaging. Properly focused however, highintensity ultrasound can be used to heat and physically\nagitate targeted tissues.\nHigh-intensity ultrasound is used routinely to treat\nsoft tissue injuries, such as strains, tears and associated\nscarring.

Higher frequency ultrasound waves produce more detailed images, but are also more readily\nabsorbed and so cannot penetrate as deeply into the\nbody. Abdominal ultrasound imaging is generally performed at frequencies between 2-5 MHz.\n3\n\n\fAbdominal ultrasound\n\nAn ultrasound machine consists of two parts: the\ntransducer and the analyzer. The transducer both produces the sound waves that penetrate the body and\nreceives the reflected echoes. Transducers are built\naround piezoelectric ceramic chips.

Bursts of high frequency electric pulses supplied\nto the transducer causes it to produce the scanning\nsound waves. The transducer then receives the returning echoes, translates them back into electric pulses\nand sends them to the analyzer\u2013a computer that organizes the data into an image on a television screen.\nBecause sound waves travel through all the body\u2019s\ntissues at nearly the same speed\u2013about 3,400 miles per\nhour\u2013the microseconds it takes for each echo to be\nreceived can be plotted on the screen as a distance into\nthe body. The relative strength of each echo, a function of the specific tissue or organ boundary that\nproduced it, can be plotted as a point of varying\nbrightness. In this way, the echoes are translated into\na picture. Tissues surrounded by bone or filled with\ngas (the stomach, intestines and bowel) cannot be\nimaged using ultrasound, because the waves are\nblocked or become randomly scattered.\nFour different modes of ultrasound are used in\nmedical imaging:\n\u0002\n\nA-mode. This is the simplest type of ultrasound in\nwhich a single transducer scans a line through the\nbody with the echoes plotted on screen as a function\nof depth. This method is used to measure distances\nwithin the body and the size of internal organs.\nTherapeutic ultrasound aimed at a specific tumor\nor calculus is also A-mode, to allow for pinpoint\naccurate focus of the destructive wave energy.\n\n\u0002\n\nB-mode. In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of\ntransducers simultaneously scans a plane through\nthe body that can be viewed as a two-dimensional\nimage on screen.

Doppler ultrasonography includes the\ncapability of accurately measuring velocities of moving material, such as blood in arteries and veins. The\nprinciple is the same as that used in radar guns that\nmeasure the speed of a car on the highway. Doppler\ncapability is most often combined with B-mode scanning to produce images of blood vessels from which\nblood flow can be directly measured. This technique\nis used extensively to investigate valve defects, arteriosclerosis and hypertension, particularly in the\nheart, but also in the abdominal aorta and the portal\nvein of the liver. These machines cost about\n$250,000.\n\nThe actual procedure for a patient undergoing an\nabdominal ultrasound is relatively simple, regardless\nof the type of scan or its purpose. Fasting for at least\neight hours prior to the procedure ensures that the\nstomach is empty and as small as possible, and that\nthe intestines and bowels are relatively inactive.\nFasting also allows the gall bladder to be seen, as it\ncontracts after eating and may not be seen if the stomach is full. In some cases, a full bladder helps to push\nintestinal folds out of the way so that the gas they\ncontain does not disrupt the image. The patient\u2019s\nabdomen is then greased with a special gel that allows\nthe ultrasound probe to glide easily across the skin\nwhile transmitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses.\nThis procedure is conducted by a doctor with the\nassistance of a technologist skilled in operating the\nequipment. The probe is moved around the abdomen\nto obtain different views of the target areas. The\npatient will likely be asked to change positions from\nside to side and to hold their breath as necessary to\nobtain the desired views. Discomfort during the procedure is minimal.\nThe many types and uses of ultrasound technology makes it difficult to generalize about the time and\ncosts involved. Relatively simple imaging\u2013scanning a\nsuspicious abdominal mass or a suspected abdominal\naortic aneurysm\u2013will take about half an hour to perform and will cost a few hundred dollars or more,\ndepending on the quality of the equipment, the\noperator and other factors.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Presently, the cause(s) of abdominal\nwall defects is unknown, and any symptoms the\nmother may have to indicate that the defects are present in the fetus are nondescript.\n\nDiagnosis\nAt birth, the problem is obvious, because the base\nof the umbilical cord at the navel will bulge or, in\nworse cases, contain viscera (internal organs). Before\nbirth, an ultrasound examination may detect the problem. It is always necessary in children with one birth\ndefect to look for others, because birth defects are\nusually multiple.\n\nTreatment\nAbdominal wall defects are effectively treated\nwith surgical repair. Unless there are accompanying\nanomalies, the surgical procedure is not overly complicated. The organs are normal, just misplaced.\nHowever, if the defect is large, it may be difficult to\nfit all the viscera into the small abdominal cavity.\n\nPrognosis\nIf there are no other defects, the prognosis after\nsurgical repair of this condition is relatively good.\nHowever, 10% of those with more severe or additional\nabnormalities die from it. The organs themselves\nare fully functional; the difficulty lies in fitting them\ninside the abdomen. The condition is, in fact, a hernia\nrequiring only replacement and strengthening of the\npassageway through which it occurred. After surgery,\nincreased pressure in the stretched abdomen can compromise the function of the organs inside.\n\nPrevention\nSome, but by no means all, birth defects are preventable by early and attentive prenatal care, good\nnutrition, supplemental vitamins, diligent avoidance\nof all unnecessary drugs and chemicals\u2013especially\ntobacco\u2013and other elements of a healthy lifestyle.\nResources\nPERIODICALS\n\nDunn, J.

It occurs in a rare\npercentage of pregnancies.\n\nPurpose\nPartial birth abortion, or D&X, is performed to\nend a pregnancy and results in the death of a fetus,\ntypically in the late second or third trimester.\nAlthough D&X is highly controversial, some physicians argue that it has advantages that make it a preferable procedure in some circumstances. One\nperceived advantage is that the fetus is removed\nlargely intact, allowing for better evaluation and\nautopsy of the fetus in cases of known fetal abnormalities. Intact removal of the fetus also may carry a lower\nrisk of puncturing the uterus or damaging the cervix.\nAnother perceived advantage is that D&X ends the\npregnancy without requiring the woman to go\nthrough labor, which may be less emotionally traumatic than other methods of late-term abortion. In\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\n\fPrecautions\nWomen considering D&X should be aware of the\nhighly controversial nature of this procedure. A controversy common to all late-term abortions is whether\nthe fetus is viable, or able to survive outside of the\nwoman\u2019s body. A specific area of controversy with\nD&X is that fetal death does not occur until after\nmost of the fetal body has exited the uterus. Several\nstates have taken legal action to limit or ban D&X and\nmany physicians who perform abortions do not perform D&X. This may restrict the availability of this\nprocedure to women seeking late-term abortions.\nIn March 2003, the United States Senate passed a\nbill banning partial birth abortions and implementing\nfines or maximum two-year jail terms for physicians\nwho perform them.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Women\nhave abortions because continuing the pregnancy\nwould cause them hardship, endanger their life or\nhealth, or because prenatal testing has shown that\nthe fetus will be born with severe abnormalities.\nAbortions are safest when performed within the\nfirst six to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period.\nThe calculation of this date is referred to as the\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\nBetween five and seven weeks, a pregnancy can be\nended by a procedure called menstrual extraction.\nThis procedure is also sometimes called menstrual\nregulation, mini-suction, or preemptive abortion.\nThe contents of the uterus are suctioned out through\na thin (3-4 mm) plastic tube that is inserted through the\nundilated cervix. Suction is applied either by a bulb\nsyringe or a small pump.\nAnother method is called the \u2018\u2018morning after\u2019\u2019 pill,\nor emergency contraception. Basically, it involves taking high doses of birth control pills within 24 to 48\nhours of having unprotected sex. The high doses of\nhormones causes the uterine lining to change so that it\nwill not support a pregnancy. Thus, if the egg has been\nfertilized, it is simply expelled from the body.\nThere are two types of emergency contraception.\nOne type is identical to ordinary birth control pills,\nand uses the hormones estrogen and progestin).\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Induced labor may\nrequire an overnight stay in a hospital. The day before\nthe procedure, the woman visits the doctor for tests,\nand to either have rods inserted in her cervix to help\ndilate it or to receive medication that will soften the\ncervix and speed up labor.\nOn the day of the abortion, drugs, usually prostaglandins to induce contractions, and a salt water\nsolution, are injected into the uterus. Contractions\nbegin, and within eight to 72 hours the woman delivers\nthe fetus.\nSide effects of this procedure include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea from the prostaglandins, and pain\nfrom uterine cramps. Anesthesia of the sort used in\nchildbirth can be given to mask the pain. Many women\nare able to go home a few hours after the procedure.\nVery early abortions cost between $200-$400.\nLater abortions cost more. The cost increases about\n$100 per week between the thirteenth and sixteenth\nweek. Second trimester abortions are much more\ncostly because they often involve more risk, more\nservices, anesthesia, and sometimes a hospital stay.\nInsurance carriers and HMOs may or may not cover\nthe procedure. Federal law prohibits federal funds\nincluding Medicaid funds, from being used to pay for\nan elective abortion.\n\nPreparation\nThe doctor must know accurately the stage of a\nwoman\u2019s pregnancy before an abortion is performed.\nThe doctor will ask the woman questions about her\nmenstrual cycle and also do a physical examination to\nconfirm the stage of pregnancy. This may be done at\nan office visit before the abortion or on the day of the\nabortion. Some states require a waiting period before\nan abortion can be performed. Others require parental\nor court consent for a child under age 18 to receive an\nabortion.\nDespite the fact that almost half of all women\nin the United States have had at least one abortion\nby the time they reach age 45, abortion is surrounded\nby controversy.

The doctor may prescribe\nantibiotics to reduce the chance of infection. Women\nwho are Rh negative (lacking genetically determined\nantigens in their red blood cells that produce immune\nresponses) should be given a human Rh immune\nglobulin (RhoGAM) after the procedure unless the\nfather of the fetus is also Rh negative. This prevents\nblood incompatibility complications in future\npregnancies.\nBleeding will continue for about five days in a\nsurgical abortion and longer in a medical abortion.\nTo decrease the risk of infection, a woman should\navoid intercourse and not use tampons and douches\nfor two weeks after the abortion.\nA follow-up visit is a necessary part of the\nwoman\u2019s aftercare. Contraception will be offered to\nwomen who wish to avoid future pregnancies, because\nmenstrual periods normally resume within a few\nweeks.\n\nRisks\nSerious complications resulting from abortions\nperformed before 13 weeks are rare. Of the 90% of\nwomen who have abortions in this time period, 2.5%\nhave minor complications that can be handled without\nhospitalization.

Blood poisoning,\nknown to physicians as septicemia, is also life\nthreatening.\nOf special note, abscesses in the hand are more\nserious than they might appear. Due to the intricate\nstructure and the overriding importance of the hand,\nany hand infection must be treated promptly and\ncompetently.\n\nPrevention\nInfections that are treated early with heat (if\nsuperficial) or antibiotics will often resolve without\nthe formation of an abscess. It is even better to avoid\ninfections altogether by taking prompt care of open\ninjuries, particularly puncture wounds. Bites are the\nmost dangerous of all, even more so because they\noften occur on the hand.\nResources\nBOOKS\n\nFauci, Anthony S., et al., editors. Harrison\u2019s Principles\nof Internal Medicine.

The injuries can include punching,\nkicking, biting, burning, beating, or pulling the victim\u2019s hair. The physical abuse inflicted on a child can\nresult in bruises, burns, poisoning, broken bones, and\ninternal hemorrhages. Physical assault against an\nadult primarily occurs with women, usually in the\nform of domestic violence. It is estimated that approximately three million children witness domestic violence every year.\nSexual abuse of a child refers to sexual behavior\nbetween an adult and child or between two children,\none of whom is dominant or significantly older. The\nsexual behaviors can include touching breasts, genitals, and buttocks; either dressed or undressed. The\nbehavior also can include exhibitionism, cunnilingus,\nfellatio, or penetration of the vagina or anus with\nsexual organs or objects.\nPornographic photography also is used in sexual\nabuse with children. Reported sex offenders are 97%\nmale. Reports of child pornography have increased\nsince with the popularity of the Internet. Females\nmore often are perpetrators in child-care settings,\nsince children may confuse sexual abuse by a female\nwith normal hygiene care. The 1990s and early 2000s\nwere rocked by reports of sexual abuse of children\ncommitted by Catholic priests. Most of the abuse\nappeared to have occurred during the 1970s and a\nprominent report released early in 2004 stated that as\nmany as 10.667 children were sexually abused by more\nthan 4,300 priests. Sexual abuse by stepfathers is five\ntimes more common than with biological fathers.\nSexual abuse of daughters by stepfathers or fathers is\nthe most common form of incest.\nSexual abuse also can take the form of rape. The\nlegal definition of rape includes only slight penile\npenetration in the victim\u2019s outer vulva area.\nComplete erection and ejaculation are not necessary.\nRape is the perpetration of an act of sexual intercourse\nwhether:\n\u0002\n\nwill is overcome by force or fear (from threats or by\nuse of drugs).\n\n\u0002\n\nmental impairment renders the victim incapable of\nrational judgment.\n\n\u0002\n\nif the victim is below the legal age established for\nconsent.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Physically abused children may complain of\nphysical illness even in the absence of a cause. They\nalso may suffer from eating disorders and encopresis,\nor involuntary defecation caused or psychic origin.\nChildren who are sexually abused may exhibit abnormal sexual behavior in the form of aggressiveness and\nhyperarousal. Adolescents may display promiscuity,\nsexual acting out, and\u2014in some situations\u2014homosexual contact.\nPhysical abuse directed towards adults can ultimately lead to death. Approximately 50% of women\n18\n\nmurdered in the United States were killed by a former\nor current male partner. Approximately one-third of\nemergency room consultations by women were\nprompted due to domestic violence. Female victims\nwho are married also have a higher rate of internal\ninjuries and unconsciousness than victims of stranger\nassault (mugging, robbery). Physical abuse or rape\nalso can occur between married persons and persons\nof the same gender. Perpetrators usually sexually\nassault their victims to dominate, hurt, and debase\nthem. It is common for physical and sexual violence\nto occur at the same time. A large percentage of sexually assaulted persons were also physically abused in\nthe form of punching, beating, or threatening the victim with a weapon such as a gun or knife. Usually\nmales who are hurt and humiliated tend to physically\nassault people whom they are intimately involved\nwith, such as spouses and/or children. Males who\nassault a female tend to have experienced or witnessed\nviolence during childhood. They also tend to abuse\nalcohol, to be sexually assaultive, and are at increased\nrisk for assaultive behavior directed against children.\nJealous males tend to monitor a women\u2019s movements\nand whereabouts and to isolate other sources of protection and support. They interpret their behavior as\nbetrayal of trust and this causes resentment and explosive anger outbursts during periods of losing control.\nMales also may use aggression against females in an\neffort to control and intimidate partners.\nAbuse in the elderly usually occurs in the frail,\nelderly community.

Injuries are visible\nby inspection or self-report. Physical abuse of an adult\nmay also be evident by inspection with visible cuts\nand/or bruises or self-report.\nSexual abuse of both a child and an adult can be\ndiagnosed with a history from the victim. Victims can\nbe assessed for signs of ejaculatory evidence from the\nperpetrator. Ejaculatory specimens can be retrieved\nfrom the mouth, rectum, and clothing. Tests for sexually transmitted diseases may be performed.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\n\fSubstance abuse can be suspected in a person who\ncontinues to indulge in their drug of choice despite\nrecurrent negative consequences. The diagnosis can\nbe made after administration of a comprehensive\nexam and standardized chemical abuse assessments\nby a therapist.\n\nTreatment\nChildren who are victims of physical or sexual\nabuse typically require psychological support and\nmedical attention. A complaint may be filed with the\nlocal family social services agency that will initiate\ninvestigations. The authorities usually will follow up\nthe allegation or offense. Children may also be\nreferred for psychological evaluation and/or treatment. The victim also may be placed in foster care\npending the investigation outcome. The police also\nmay investigate physical and sexual abuse of an\nadult. The victim may require immediate medical\ncare and long-term psychological treatment. It is common for children to be adversely affected by domestic\nviolence situations and the local family services agency\nmay be involved.\nSubstance abusers should elect treatment, either\ninpatient or outpatient, depending on severity of\naddiction. Long term treatment and/or medications\nmay be utilized to assist in abstinence. The patient\nshould be encouraged to participate in community\ncentered support groups.\n\nPrognosis\nThe prognosis depends on the diagnosis.\nUsually victims of physical and sexual abuse require\ntherapy to deal with emotional distress associated\nwith the incident. Perpetrators require further psychological evaluation and treatment. Victims of\nabuse may have a variety of emotional problems\nincluding depression, acts of suicide, or anxiety.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

The ingredients listing on the container should state if acetaminophen is included in the product.\nStudies have shown that acetaminophen relieves\npain and reduces fever about as well as aspirin. But\ndifferences between these two common drugs exist.\nAcetaminophen is less likely than aspirin to irritate\nthe stomach. However, unlike aspirin, acetaminophen\ndoes not reduce the redness, stiffness, or swelling that\naccompany arthritis.\n\nRecommended dosage\nThe usual dosage for adults and children age 12\nand over is 325-650 mg every four to six hours as\nneeded. No more than 4 grams (4000 mg) should be\ntaken in 24 hours. Because the drug can potentially\nharm the liver, people who drink alcohol in large\nquantities should take considerably less acetaminophen and possibly should avoid the drug completely.\nFor children ages 6-11 years, the usual dose is 150300 mg, three to four times a day. A physician should\nrecommend doses for children under age 6 years.\n\nPrecautions\nIn 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) launched an advertising campaign aimed at\neducating consumers about proper use of acetaminophen and other over-the-counter pain killers. Often,\nacetaminophen is hidden in many cold and flu products\nand people unexpectedly overdose on the medicine.\nSome cases have led to liver transplantation or death.\nMore than the recommended dosage of acetaminophen\nshould not be taken unless told to do so by a physician\nor dentist.\nPatients should not use acetaminophen for more\nthan 10 days to relieve pain (five days for children) or\nfor more than three days to reduce fever, unless directed to do so by a physician.

Cancer of the esophagus occurs\nas a complication of achalasia in 2-7% of patients.\n\nAchalasia is a disorder of the esophagus that\nprevents normal swallowing.\n\nDescription\nAchalasia affects the esophagus, the tube that\ncarries swallowed food from the back of the throat\ndown into the stomach. A ring of muscle called the\nlower esophageal sphincter encircles the esophagus\njust above the entrance to the stomach. This sphincter\nmuscle is normally contracted to close the esophagus.\nWhen the sphincter is closed, the contents of the stomach cannot flow back into the esophagus. Backward\nflow of stomach contents (reflux) can irritate and\ninflame the esophagus, causing symptoms such as\nheartburn. The act of swallowing causes a wave of\nesophageal contraction called peristalsis. Peristalsis\npushes food along the esophagus. Normally, peristalsis causes the esophageal sphincter to relax and allow\nfood into the stomach. In achalasia, which means\n\u2018\u2018failure to relax,\u2019\u2019 the esophageal sphincter remains\ncontracted. Normal peristalsis is interrupted and food\ncannot enter the stomach.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\nTreatment\nThe first-line treatment for achalasia is balloon\ndilation. In this procedure, an inflatable membrane\nor balloon is passed down the esophagus to the sphincter and inflated to force the sphincter open.

The disorder\nappears in approximately one in every 10,000\nbirths. Achondroplasia is usually diagnosed at birth,\nowing to the characteristic appearance of the\nnewborn.\nNormal bone growth depends on the production of cartilage (a fibrous connective tissue). Over\ntime, calcium is deposited within the cartilage,\ncausing it to harden and become bone. In achondroplasia, abnormalities of this process prevent the\nbones (especially those in the limbs) from growing\nas long as they normally should, at the same time\nallowing the bones to become abnormally thickened. The bones in the trunk of the body and the\nskull are mostly not affected, although the opening\nfrom the skull through which the spinal cord\npasses (foramen magnum) is often narrower than\nnormal, and the opening (spinal canal) through\nwhich the spinal cord runs in the back bones (vertebrae) becomes increasingly and abnormally small\ndown the length of the spine.\n\nCauses and symptoms\nPrognosis\nMost patients with achalasia can be treated effectively. Achalasia does not reduce life expectancy\nunless esophageal carcinoma develops.\n22\n\nAchondroplasia is caused by a genetic defect. It is\na dominant trait, meaning that anybody with\nthe genetic defect will display all the symptoms of\nthe disorder.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Acid phosphatase testing is done to diagnose\nwhether prostate cancer has spread to other parts of\nthe body (metastasized), and to check the effectiveness\nof treatment. The test has been largely supplanted by\nthe prostate specific antigen test (PSA).\n\nPurpose\nThe male prostate gland has 100 times more\nacid phosphatase than any other body tissue.\nWhen prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the\nbody, acid phosphatase levels rise, particularly if\nthe cancer spreads to the bone. One-half to threefourths of persons who have metastasized prostate\ncancer have high acid phosphatase levels. Levels fall\nafter the tumor is removed or reduced through\ntreatment.\n24\n\nLaboratory testing measures the amount of acid\nphosphatase in a person\u2019s blood, and can determine\nfrom what tissue the enzyme is coming. For example, it\nis important to know if the increased acid phosphatase\nis from the prostate or red blood cells.

Up to 20% of women develop mild acne. It is\nalso found in some newborns.\nThe sebaceous glands lie just beneath the skin\u2019s\nsurface. They produce an oil called sebum, the skin\u2019s\nnatural moisturizer. These glands and the hair follicles\nwithin which they are found are called sebaceous\nfollicles. These follicles open onto the skin through\npores. At puberty, increased levels of androgens\n(male hormones) cause the glands to produce too\nmuch sebum. When excess sebum combines with\ndead, sticky skin cells, a hard plug, or comedo, forms\nthat blocks the pore. Mild noninflammatory acne consists of the two types of comedones, whiteheads and\nblackheads.\nModerate and severe inflammatory types of acne\nresult after the plugged follicle is invaded by\nPropionibacterium acnes, a bacteria that normally\nlives on the skin. A pimple forms when the damaged\nfollicle weakens and bursts open, releasing sebum,\nbacteria, and skin and white blood cells into the surrounding tissues. Inflamed pimples near the skin\u2019s surface are called papules; when deeper, they are called\npustules. The most severe type of acne consists of cysts\n(closed sacs) and nodules (hard swellings). Scarring\noccurs when new skin cells are laid down to replace\ndamaged cells.\nThe most common sites of acne are the face, chest,\nshoulders, and back since these are the parts of the\nbody where the most sebaceous follicles are found.\n\nAcid reflux see Heartburn\nAcidosis see Respiratory acidosis; Renal\ntubular acidosis; Metabolic acidosis\n\nI Acne\n\nCauses and symptoms\nThe exact cause of acne is unknown.

The vestibular and cochlear nerves lie next to one another. They\nalso run along side other cranial nerves. People possess\ntwo of each type of vestibulocochlear nerve, one that\nextends from the left ear and one that extends from the\nright ear.\nThe vestibular nerve transmits information concerning balance from the inner ear to the brain and the\ncochlear nerve transmits information about hearing.\nThe vestibular nerve, like many nerves, is surrounded\nby a cover called a myelin sheath. A tumor, called\na schwannoma, can sometimes develop from the cells\nof the myelin sheath. A tumor is an abnormal growth\nof tissue that results from the uncontrolled growth of\ncells.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

A unilateral tumor is a tumor arising from one nerve and\na bilateral tumor arises from both vestibular nerves.\nUnilateral acoustic neuromas usually occur spontaneously (by chance). Bilateral acoustic neuromas\noccur as part of a hereditary condition called\nNeurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2). A person with\nNF2 has inherited a predisposition for developing acoustic neuromas and other tumors of the\nnerve cells.\nAcoustic neuromas usually grow slowly and\ncan take years to develop. Some acoustic neuromas\nremain so small that they do not cause any symptoms. As the acoustic neuroma grows it can interfere with the functioning of the vestibular nerve\nand can cause vertigo and balance difficulties. If\nthe acoustic nerve grows large enough to press\nagainst the cochlear nerve, then hearing loss and\na ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear will usually\noccur. If untreated and the acoustic neuroma continues to grow it can press against other nerves in\nthe region and cause other symptoms.

People with acoustic neuromas sometimes report difficulties in using the phone\nand difficulties in perceiving the tone of a musical\ninstrument or sound even when their hearing appears\nto be otherwise normal. In most cases the hearing loss\nis initially subtle and worsens gradually over time\nuntil deafness occurs in the affected ear. In approximately 10% of cases the hearing loss is sudden and\nsevere.\nAcoustic neuromas can also affect the functioning of the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear\nnerve and van cause vertigo and dysequilibrium.\nTwenty percent of small tumors are associated with\nperiodic vertigo, which is characterized by dizziness\nor a whirling sensation. Larger acoustic neuromas are\nless likely to cause vertigo but more likely to cause\ndysequilibrium. Dysequilibrium, which is characterized by minor clumsiness and a general feeling of\ninstability, occurs in nearly 50% of people with an\nacoustic neuroma.\nAs the tumor grows larger it can press on the\nsurrounding cranial nerves.

The brain stem is the stalk like\nportion of the brain that joins the spinal cord to the\ncerebrum, the thinking and reasoning part of the\nbrain. Different parts of the brainstem have different\nfunctions such as the control of breathing and muscle\ncoordination. Large tumors that impact the brain\nstem can result in headaches, walking difficulties\n(gait ataxia) and involuntary shaking movements of\nthe muscles (tremors). In rare cases when an acoustic\nneuroma remains undiagnosed and untreated it can\ncause nausea, vomiting, lethargy and eventually\ncoma, respiratory difficulties and death. In the vast\nmajority of cases, however, the tumor is discovered\nand treated long before it is large enough to cause\nsuch serious manifestations.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\n\fAnyone with symptoms of hearing loss should\nundergo hearing evaluations. Pure tone and speech\naudiometry are two screening tests that are often\nused to evaluate hearing. Pure tone audiometry\ntests to see how well someone can hear tones of\ndifferent volume and pitch and speech audiometry\ntests to see how well someone can hear and recognize speech. An acoustic neuroma is suspected in\nsomeone with unilateral hearing loss or hearing loss\nthat is less severe in one ear than the other ear\n(asymmetrical).\nSometimes an auditory brainstem response (ABR,\nBAER) test is performed to help establish whether\nsomeone is likely to have an acoustic neuroma.\nDuring the ABR examination, a harmless electrical\nimpulse is passed from the inner ear to the brainstem.\nAn acoustic neuroma can interfere with the passage of\nthis electrical impulse and this interference can, sometimes be identified through the ABR evaluation.\nA normal ABR examination does not rule out the\npossibility of an acoustic neuroma. An abnormal\nABR examination increases the likelihood that an\nacoustic neuroma is present but other tests are necessary to confirm the presence of a tumor.\nIf an acoustic neuroma is strongly suspected then\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually performed.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

The purpose\nof this evaluation is to obtain a detailed family history\nand check for signs of NF2. If NF2 is strongly suspected then DNA testing may be recommended. DNA\ntesting involves checking the blood cells obtained from\na routine blood draw for the common gene changes\nassociated with NF2.\n\nTreatment\nThe three treatment options for acoustic neuroma\nare surgery, radiation, and observation. The physician\nand patient should discuss the pros and cons of\nthe different options prior to making a decision\nabout treatment. The patient\u2019s, physical health, age,\nsymptoms, tumor size, and tumor location should be\nconsidered.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\nMicrosurgery\nThe surgical removal of the tumor or tumors is the\nmost common treatment for acoustic neuroma. In\nmost cases the entire tumor is removed during the\nsurgery. If the tumor is large and causing significant\nsymptoms, yet there is a need to preserve hearing\nin that ear, then only part of the tumor may be\nremoved. During the procedure the tumor is removed\nunder microscopic guidance and general anesthetic.\nMonitoring of the neighboring cranial nerves is done\nduring the procedure so that damage to these nerves\ncan be prevented. If preservation of hearing is a possibility, then monitoring of hearing will also take place\nduring the surgery.\nMost people stay in the hospital four to seven days\nfollowing the surgery. Total recovery usually takes\nfour to six weeks. Most people experience fatigue and\nhead discomfort following the surgery. Problems with\nbalance and head and neck stiffness are also common.\nThe mortality rate of this type of surgery is less than\n2% at most major centers. Approximately 20% of\npatients experience some degree of post-surgical complications.

A follow-up MRI is recommended one to five\nyears following the surgery because of possible\nregrowth of the tumor.\nStereotactic radiation therapy\nDuring stereotactic radiation therapy, also called\nradiosurgery or radiotherapy, many small beams of\nradiation are aimed directly at the acoustic neuroma.\nThe radiation is administered in a single large dose,\nunder local anesthetic and is performed on an outpatient basis. This results in a high dose of radiation\nto the tumor but little radiation exposure to the\nsurrounding area. This treatment approach is limited\nto small or medium tumors. The goal of the surgery is\nto cause tumor shrinkage or at least limit the growth\nof the tumor. The long-term efficacy and risks of this\ntreatment approach are not known; however, as of\nthe early 2000s, more and more patients diagnosed\nwith acoustic neuromas are choosing this form of\ntherapy. Periodic MRI monitoring throughout the\nlife of the patient is therefore recommended.\nRadiation therapy can cause hearing loss which\ncan sometimes occurs even years later. Radiation therapy can also cause damage to neighboring cranial\n31\n\nAcoustic neuroma\n\nDiagnosis\n\n\fAcrocyanosis\n\nnerves, which can result in symptoms such as numbness, pain or paralysis of the facial muscles. In many\ncases these symptoms are temporary. Radiation treatment can also induce the formation of other benign or\nmalignant schwannomas. This type of treatment may\ntherefore be contraindicated in the treatment of acoustic neuromas in those with NF2 who are predisposed\nto developing schwannomas and other tumors.\nObservation\nAcoustic neuromas are usually slow growing and\nin some cases they will stop growing and even become\nsmaller or disappear entirely. It may therefore be\nappropriate in some cases to hold off on treatment\nand to periodically monitor the tumor through MRI\nevaluations. Long-term observation may be appropriate for example in an elderly person with a small\nacoustic neuroma and few symptoms.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

The spasms are a contraction\nof the muscles in the walls of the blood vessels. The\ncontraction decreases the internal diameter of the\nblood vessels, thereby decreasing the amount of\nblood flow through the affected area. The spasms\noccur on a persistent basis, resulting in long term\nreduction of blood supply to the hands and feet.\nSufficient blood still passes through the blood vessels\nso that the tissue in the affected areas does not starve\nfor oxygen or die. Mainly, blood vessels near the surface of the skin are affected.\n\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is made by observation of the main\nclinical symptoms, including persistently blue and\nsweaty hands and/or feet and a lack of pain.

This chemical\nreleased from the pituitary gland is called growth\nhormone (GH). The body\u2019s ability to process and\nuse nutrients like fats and sugars is also altered. In\nchildren whose bony growth plates have not closed,\nthe chemical changes of acromegaly result in\nexceptional growth of long bones. This variant is\ncalled gigantism, with the additional bone growth\ncausing unusual height. When the abnormality occurs\nafter bone growth stops, the disorder is called\nacromegaly.\n\nDescription\nAcromegaly is a relatively rare disorder, occurring\nin approximately 50 out of every one million people\n(50/1,000,000). Both men and women are affected.\nBecause the symptoms of acromegaly occur so gradually, diagnosis is often delayed.

Overproduction of the pituitary hormone\ncalled growth hormone (GH) is responsible for the\ncondition known as acromegaly.\n\nEnlarged feet is one deformity caused by acromegaly.\n(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)\n\nCauses and symptoms\nThe pituitary is a small gland located at the base of\nthe brain. A gland is a collection of cells that releases\ncertain chemicals, or hormones, which are important\nto the functioning of other organs or body systems.\nThe pituitary hormones travel throughout the body\nand are involved in a large number of activities,\nincluding the regulation of growth and reproductive\nfunctions. The cause of acromegaly can be traced to\nthe pituitary\u2019s production of GH.\nUnder normal conditions, the pituitary receives\ninput from another brain structure, the hypothalamus,\nlocated at the base of the brain. This input from the\nhypothalamus regulates the pituitary\u2019s release of hormones. For example, the hypothalamus produces\ngrowth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which\ndirects the pituitary to release GH. Input from the\nhypothalamus should also direct the pituitary to stop\nreleasing hormones.\n34\n\nIn acromegaly, the pituitary continues to release\nGH and ignores signals from the hypothalamus. In the\nliver, GH causes production of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is responsible\nfor growth throughout the body. When the pituitary\nrefuses to stop producing GH, the levels of IGF-1 also\nreach abnormal peaks. Bones, soft tissue, and organs\nthroughout the body begin to enlarge, and the body\nchanges its ability to process and use nutrients like\nsugars and fats.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

It is characterized by the presence of a\nlump or mass that often forms, draining sinus tracts\nto the skin surface. Fifty percent of actinomycosis\ncases are of the head and neck region (also called\n\u2018\u2018lumpy jaw\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018cervicofacial actinomycosis\u2019\u2019),\n15% are in the chest, 20% are in the abdomen, and\nthe rest are in the pelvis, heart, and brain. Men are\nthree times more likely to develop actinomycosis than\nwomen.\n\n36\n\nKEY TERMS\n\nActinomycosis is usually caused by the bacterium\nActinomyces israelii. This bacterium is normally present in the mouth but can cause disease if it enters\ntissues following an injury. Actinomyces israelii is an\nanaerobic bacterium which means it dislikes oxygen\nbut grows very well in deep tissues where oxygen levels\nare low. Tooth extraction, tooth disease, root canal\ntreatment, jaw surgery, or poor dental hygiene can\nallow Actinomyces israelii to cause an infection in the\nhead and neck region.\nThe main symptom of cervicofacial actinomycosis\nis the presence of a hard lump on the face or neck. The\nlump may or may not be red. Fever occurs in some\ncases.\n\nDiagnosis\nCervicofacial actinomycosis can be diagnosed by\na family doctor or dentist and the patient may be\nreferred to an oral surgeon or infectious disease\nspecialist. The diagnosis of actinomycosis is based\nupon several things. The presence of a red lump with\ndraining sinuses on the head or neck is strongly\nsuggestive of cervicofacial actinomycosis. A recent\nhistory of tooth extraction or signs of tooth decay or\npoor dental hygiene aid in the diagnosis. Microscopic\nexamination of the fluid draining from the sinuses\nshows the characteristic \u2018\u2018sulfur Granules\u2019\u2019 (small\nyellow colored material in the fluid) produced by\nActinomyces israelii.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Actinomycosis\n\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\n\fTreatment\nActinomycosis is difficult to treat because of its\ndense tissue location. Surgery is often required to\ndrain the lesion and/or to remove the site of infection. To kill the bacteria, standard therapy has\nincluded large doses of penicillin given through a\nvein daily for two to six weeks followed by six to\ntwelve months of penicillin taken by mouth.\nTetracycline, clindamycin, or erythromycin may be\nused instead of penicillin. The antibiotic therapy\nmust be completed to ensure that the infection\ndoes not return. However, a report in 2004 on\nseveral cases of actinomycosis said that therapy\ndepends on the individual case and that many\npatients today will be diagnosed in earlier stages\nof the disease. Sometimes, shorter courses of antibiotic treatment are effective, with close diagnostic\nx-ray monitoring. Hyperbaric oxygen (oxygen\nunder high pressure) therapy in combination with\nthe antibiotic therapy has been successful.\n\nPrognosis\nComplete recovery is achieved following treatment. If left untreated, the infection may cause localized bone destruction.\n\nI Acupressure\nDefinition\nAcupressure is a form of touch therapy that\nutilizes the principles of acupuncture and Chinese\nmedicine. In acupressure, the same points on the\nbody are used as in acupuncture, but are stimulated\nwith finger pressure instead of with the insertion of\nneedles. Acupressure is used to relieve a variety of\nsymptoms and pain.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Later, he wrote some convincing stories\non its effectiveness.

Today, there are millions\nof patients who attest to its effectiveness, and nearly\n9,000 practitioners in all 50 states.\nAcupressure is practiced as a treatment by Chinese\nmedicine practitioners and acupuncturists, as well as\nby massage therapists.

A Chinese medicine practitioner examines a\npatient very thoroughly, looking at physical, mental\nand emotional activity, taking the pulse usually at the\nwrists, examining the tongue and complexion, and\nobserving the patient\u2019s demeanor and attitude, to get\na complete diagnosis of which organs and meridian\npoints are out of balance. When the imbalance is\nlocated, the physician will recommend specific pressure points for acupuncture or acupressure. If acupressure is recommended, the patient might opt for a series\nof treatments from a massage therapist.\nIn massage therapy, acupressurists will evaluate a\npatient\u2019s symptoms and overall health, but a massage\ntherapist\u2019s diagnostic training isn\u2019t as extensive as a\nChinese physician\u2019s. In a massage therapy treatment, a\nperson usually lies down on a table or mat, with thin\nclothing on. The acupressurist will gently feel and\npalpate the abdomen and other parts of the body to\ndetermine energy imbalances.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

The therapist will use different types of\nfinger movements and pressure on different acupoints,\ndepending on whether the chi needs to be increased\nor dispersed at different points. The therapist observes\nand guides the energy flow through the patient\u2019s body\nthroughout the session. Sometimes, special herbs\n(Artemesia vulgaris or moxa) may be placed on a\npoint to warm it, a process called moxibustion. A session of acupressure is generally a very pleasant experience, and some people experience great benefit\nimmediately. For more chronic conditions, several\nsessions may be necessary to relieve and improve\nconditions.\nAcupressure massage usually costs from $30\u201370\nper hour session. A visit to a Chinese medicine physician or acupuncturist can be more expensive, comparable to a visit to an allopathic physician if the\npractitioner is an MD. Insurance reimbursement varies widely, and consumers should be aware if their\npolicies cover alternative treatment, acupuncture, or\nmassage therapy.\n\n40\n\nSelf-treatment\nAcupressure is easy to learn, and there are many\ngood books that illustrate the position of acupoints\nand meridians on the body. It is also very versatile, as\nit can be done anywhere, and it\u2019s a good form of\ntreatment for spouses and partners to give to each\nother and for parents to perform on children for\nminor conditions.\nWhile giving self-treatment or performing acupressure on another, a mental attitude of calmness\nand attention is important, as one person\u2019s energy\ncan be used to help another\u2019s. Loose, thin clothing is\nrecommended. There are three general techniques for\nstimulating a pressure point.\n\u0002\n\nTonifying is meant to strengthen weak chi, and is\ndone by pressing the thumb or finger into an acupoint with a firm, steady pressure, holding it for up to\ntwo minutes.\n\n\u0002\n\nDispersing is meant to move stagnant or blocked\nchi, and the finger or thumb is moved in a circular\nmotion or slightly in and out of the point for two\nminutes.\n\n\u0002\n\nCalming the chi in a pressure point utilizes the palm\nto cover the point and gently stroke the area for\nabout two minutes.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

For\ninstance, Western scientists have trouble with the\nidea of chi, the invisible energy of the body, and the\nidea that pressing on certain points can alleviate\ncertain conditions seems sometimes too simple for\nscientists to believe.\nWestern scientists, in trying to account for the\naction of acupressure, have theorized that chi is actually part of the neuroendocrine system of the body.\nCelebrated orthopedic surgeon Robert O. Becker,\nwho was twice nominated for the Nobel Prize, wrote\na book on the subject called Cross Currents: The\nPromise of Electromedicine; The Perils of Electropollution. By using precise electrical measuring\ndevices, Becker and his colleagues showed that the\nbody has a complex web of electromagnetic energy,\nand that traditional acupressure meridians and points\ncontained amounts of energy that non-acupressure\npoints did not.\nThe mechanisms of acupuncture and acupressure remain difficult to document in terms of the\nbiochemical processes involved; numerous testimonials are the primary evidence backing up the\neffectiveness of acupressure and acupuncture.\nHowever, a body of research is growing that verifies the effectiveness in acupressure and acupuncture techniques in treating many problems and in\ncontrolling pain.\n\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\nAmerican Association of Oriental Medicine.December 28,\n2000. <http://www.aaom.org>.\nNational Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine Alliance.\nDecember 28, 2000. <http://www.acuall.org>.\n\nDouglas Dupler, MA\n\nAcupressure, foot see Reflexology\n\nI Acupuncture\nDefinition\nAcupuncture is one of the main forms of treatment in traditional Chinese medicine.

Acupuncture has been used in the\ntreatment of alcoholism and substance abuse. It is\nan effective and low-cost treatment for headaches\nand chronic pain, associated with problems like\nback injuries and arthritis. It has also been used\nto supplement invasive Western treatments like\nchemotherapy and surgery. Acupuncture is generally\nmost effective when used as prevention or before a\nhealth condition becomes acute, but it has been used\nto help patients suffering from cancer and AIDS.\nAcupuncture is limited in treating conditions or\ntraumas that require surgery or emergency care\n(such as for broken bones).\n41\n\n\fAcupuncture\nWoman undergoing facial acupuncture.

Thousands of books since then have been written\non the subject of Chinese healing, and its basic philosophies spread long ago to other Asian civilizations.\nNearly all of the forms of Oriental medicine which are\nused in the West today, including acupuncture, shiatsu,\nacupressure massage, and macrobiotics, are part of or\nhave their roots in Chinese medicine. Legend has it that\nacupuncture developed when early Chinese physicians\nobserved unpredicted effects of puncture wounds in\nChinese warriors. The oldest known text on acupuncture, the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture, dates back\nto 282 A.D. Although acupuncture is its best known\ntechnique, Chinese medicine traditionally utilizes herbal remedies, dietary therapy, lifestyle changes and\nother means to treat patients.\nIn the early 1900s, only a few Western physicians\nwho had visited China were fascinated by acupuncture,\n42\n\nbut outside of Asian-American communities it\nremained virtually unknown until the 1970s, when\nRichard Nixon became the first U.S. president to\nvisit China.

Chinese medicine\ndoes not draw a sharp line, as Western medicine does,\nbetween mind and body. The Chinese system believes\nthat emotions and mental states are every bit as\ninfluential on disease as purely physical mechanisms,\nand considers factors like work, environment, lifestyle and relationships as fundamental to the overall\npicture of a patient\u2019s health. Chinese medicine also\nuses very different symbols and ideas to discuss the\nbody and health. While Western medicine typically\ndescribes health in terms of measurable physical\nprocesses made up of chemical reactions, the Chinese\nuse ideas like yin and yang, chi, the organ system, and\n43\n\n\fAcupuncture\n\nthe five elements to describe health and the body. To\nunderstand the ideas behind acupuncture, it is worthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms.\nYIN AND YANG. According to Chinese philosophy,\nthe universe and the body can be described by two\nseparate but complementary principles, that of yin\nand yang. For example, in temperature, yin is cold\nand yang is hot. In gender, yin is female and yang is\nmale. In activity, yin is passive and yang is active. In\nlight, yin is dark and yang is bright; in direction yin is\ninward and downward and yang is outward and up,\nand so on. Nothing is ever completely yin or yang, but\na combination of the two. These two principles are\nalways interacting, opposing, and influencing each\nother. The goal of Chinese medicine is not to eliminate\neither yin or yang, but to allow the two to balance each\nother and exist harmoniously together. For instance, if\na person suffers from symptoms of high blood pressure,\nthe Chinese system would say that the heart organ\nmight have too much yang, and would recommend\nmethods either to reduce the yang or to increase the\nyin of the heart, depending on the other symptoms and\norgans in the body. Thus, acupuncture therapies seek to\neither increase or reduce yang, or increase or reduce yin\nin particular regions of the body.\nCHI. Another fundamental concept of Chinese\nmedicine is that of chi (pronounced chee, also spelled\nqi).\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

In the body, it is the\ninvisible vital force that creates and animates life.\nWe are all born with inherited amounts of chi, and\nwe also get acquired chi from the food we eat and the\nair we breathe. The level and quality of a person\u2019s chi\nalso depends on the state of physical, mental and\nemotional balance. Chi travels through the body\nalong channels called meridians.\nTHE ORGAN SYSTEM. In the Chinese system, there\nare twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, stomach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder,\nkidney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the \u2018\u2018triple\nwarmer,\u2019\u2019 which represents the entire torso region.\nEach organ has chi energy associated with it, and\neach organ interacts with particular emotions on the\nmental level. As there are twelve organs, there are\ntwelve types of chi which can move through the body,\nand these move through twelve main channels or meridians. Chinese doctors connect symptoms to organs.\nThat is, symptoms are caused by yin/yang imbalances\nin one or more organs, or by an unhealthy flow of chi\nto or from one organ to another. Each organ has a\ndifferent profile of symptoms it can manifest.\n\n44\n\nTHE FIVE ELEMENTS. Another basis of Chinese theory is that the world and body are made up of five\nmain elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.\nThese elements are all interconnected, and each element either generates or controls another element. For\ninstance, water controls fire and earth generates metal.\nEach organ is associated with one of the five elements.\nThe Chinese system uses elements and organs to\ndescribe and treat conditions. For instance, the kidney\nis associated with water and the heart is associated\nwith fire, and the two organs are related as water and\nfire are related. If the kidney is weak, then there might\nbe a corresponding fire problem in the heart, so treatment might be made by acupuncture or herbs to cool\nthe heart system and/or increase energy in the kidney\nsystem.\n\nThe Chinese have developed an intricate system of\nhow organs and elements are related to physical and\nmental symptoms, and the above example is a very\nsimple one.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

For instance, Western medicine has\nobserved that with severe heart problems, kidney failure often follows, but it still does not know exactly\nwhy. In Chinese medicine, this connection between the\ntwo organs has long been established.\nMEDICAL PROBLEMS AND ACUPUNCTURE. In\nChinese medicine, disease as seen as imbalances in\nthe organ system or chi meridians, and the goal of\nany remedy or treatment is to assist the body in reestablishing its innate harmony. Disease can be caused\nby internal factors like emotions, external factors like\nthe environment and weather, and other factors like\ninjuries, trauma, diet, and germs. However, infection\nis seen not as primarily a problem with germs and\nviruses, but as a weakness in the energy of the body\nwhich is allowing a sickness to occur. In Chinese medicine, no two illnesses are ever the same, as each body\nhas its own characteristics of symptoms and balance.\nAcupuncture is used to open or adjust the flow of chi\nthroughout the organ system, which will strengthen\nthe body and prompt it to heal itself.\nA VISIT TO THE ACUPUNCTURIST. The first thing\nan acupuncturist will do is get a thorough idea of a\npatient\u2019s medical history and symptoms, both physical and emotional. This is done with a long questionnaire and interview.

From this, the\npractitioner will be able to determine patterns of\n\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\n\fAcupuncture needles are always sterilized and\nacupuncture is a very safe procedure.

They perform the critical task of processing approximately 200 quarts of fluid in the\nbloodstream every 24 hours. Waste products like\nurea and toxins, along with excess fluids, are\nremoved from the bloodstream in the form of\nurine. Kidney (or renal) failure occurs when kidney\nfunctioning becomes impaired. Fluids and toxins\nbegin to accumulate in the bloodstream. As fluids\nbuild up in the bloodstream, the patient with acute\nkidney failure may become puffy and swollen (edematous) in the face, hands, and feet. Their blood\npressure typically begins to rise, and they may\nexperience fatigue and nausea.\nUnlike chronic kidney failure, which is long\nterm and irreversible, acute kidney failure is a\ntemporary condition.

The ECC is made up\nof plastic blood tubing, a filter known as a dialyzer (or\nartificial kidney), and a dialysis machine that monitors\nand maintains blood flow and administers dialysate.\nDialysate is a sterile chemical solution that is used to\ndraw waste products out of the blood. The patient\u2019s\nblood leaves the body through the vein and travels\nthrough the ECC and the dialyzer, where fluid\nremoval takes place.\nDuring dialysis, waste products in the bloodstream are carried out of the body. At the same time,\nelectrolytes and other chemicals are added to the\nblood. The purified, chemically-balanced blood is\nthen returned to the body.\n47\n\nAcute kidney failure\n\nCommon symptoms of acute kidney failure\ninclude:\n\n\fAcute kidney failure\n\nA dialysis \u2018\u2018run\u2019\u2019 typically lasts three to four hours,\ndepending on the type of dialyzer used and the physical\ncondition of the patient. Dialysis is used several times a\nweek until acute kidney failure is reversed.\nBlood pressure changes associated with hemodialysis may pose a risk for patients with heart problems.\nPeritoneal dialysis may be the preferred treatment\noption in these cases.\n\nHemofiltration\nHemofiltration, also called continuous renal\nreplacement therapy (CRRT), is a slow, continuous\nblood filtration therapy used to control acute kidney\nfailure in critically ill patients. These patients are\ntypically very sick and may have heart problems or\ncirculatory problems. They cannot handle the rapid\nfiltration rates of hemodialysis. They also frequently\nneed antibiotics, nutrition, vasopressors, and other\nfluids given through a vein to treat their primary\ncondition. Because hemofiltration is continuous,\nprescription fluids can be given to patients in kidney\nfailure without the risk of fluid overload.\nLike hemodialysis, hemofiltration uses an ECC.\nA hollow fiber hemofilter is used instead of a dialyzer\nto remove fluids and toxins.

After a certain time period, the waste-filled\ndialysate is drained from the abdomen, and replaced\nwith clean dialysate. There are three type of peritoneal\ndialysis, which vary according to treatment time and\nadministration method.\nPeritoneal dialysis is often the best treatment\noption for infants and children.

Acute lymphangitis could be diagnosed\nby the family doctor, infectious disease specialist,\nor an emergency room doctor. The painful, red\nstreaks just below the skin surface and the high\nfever are diagnostic of acute lymphangitis. A sample\nof blood would be taken for culture to determine\nwhether the bacteria have entered the bloodstream.\nA biopsy (removal of a piece of infected tissue)\nsample may be taken for culture to identify which\ntype of bacteria is causing the infection. Diagnosis is\nimmediate because it is based primarily on the symptoms. Most insurance policies should cover the\nexpenses for the diagnosis and treatment of acute\nlymphangitis.\n\nTreatment\nBecause of the serious nature of this infection, treatment would begin immediately even before the bacterial\nculture results were available. The only treatment for\nacute lymphangitis is to give very large doses of an\nantibiotic, usually penicillin, through the vein. Growing streptococcal bacteria are usually eliminated rapidly\nand easily by penicillin. The antibiotic clindamycin may\nbe included in the treatment to kill any streptococci\nwhich are not growing and are in a resting state.\n49\n\nAcute lymphangitis\n\nI Acute lymphangitis\n\n\fAcute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis\n\nAlternatively, a \u2018\u2018broad spectrum\u2019\u2019 antibiotic may be\nused which would kill many different kinds of bacteria.\n\nKEY TERMS\nStreptococcus\u2014A gram-positive, round or oval\nbacteria in the genus Streptococcus.

Acute lymphangitis that goes untreated can spread, causing tissue\ndamage. Extensive tissue damage would need to be\nrepaired by plastic surgery.

Some\nresearchers speak of two types of addictions: substance addictions (for example, alcoholism, drug\nabuse, and smoking); and process addictions (for\nexample, gambling, spending, shopping, eating, and\nsexual activity). There is a growing recognition that\nmany addicts, such as polydrug abusers, are addicted\nto more than one substance or process.\n\nDescription\nAddiction is one of the most costly public\nhealth problems in the United States. It is a progressive syndrome, which means that it increases in\nseverity over time unless it is treated. Substance\nabuse is characterized by frequent relapse, or return\nto the abused substance. Substance abusers often\nmake repeated attempts to quit before they are\nsuccessful.\nThe economic cost of substance abuse in the\nUnited States exceeds $414 billion, with health care\ncosts attributed to substance abuse estimated at more\nthan $114 billion.\nBy eighth grade, 52% of adolescents have consumed alcohol, 41% have smoked tobacco, and 20%\nhave smoked marijuana. Compared to females, males\nare almost four times as likely to be heavy drinkers,\nnearly one and a half more likely to smoke a pack or\nmore of cigarettes daily, and twice as likely to smoke\nmarijuana weekly. However, among adolescents\nthese gender differences are not as pronounced and\ngirls are almost as likely to abuse substances such\nas alcohol and cigarettes. Although frequent use\nof tobacco, cocaine and heavy drinking appears\nto remain stable in the 1990s, marijuana use has\nincreased.\nAn estimated four million Americans over the age\nof 12 used prescription pain relievers, sedatives, and\nstimulants for \u2018\u2018nonmedical\u2019\u2019 reasons during one\nmonth.\nIn the United States, 25% of the population regularly uses tobacco. Tobacco use reportedly kills 2.5\ntimes as many people each year as alcohol and drug\nabuse combined.

The anterior cingulated cortex in the frontal lobe of the brain is\nthe area responsible for long-term craving in addicts.\nKnowing the area of the brain from which long-term\ncravings come may help scientists pinpoint therapies.\nSocial learning\nSocial learning is considered the most important\nsingle factor in addiction. It includes patterns of use in\nthe addict\u2019s family or subculture, peer pressure, and\nadvertising or media influence.\nAvailability\nInexpensive or readily available tobacco, alcohol,\nor drugs produce marked increases in rates of\naddiction.\nIndividual development\nBefore the 1980s, the so-called addictive personality was used to explain the development of addiction. The addictive personality was described as\nescapist, impulsive, dependent, devious, manipulative,\nand self-centered. Many doctors now believe that\nthese character traits develop in addicts as a result of\nthe addiction, rather than the traits being a cause of\nthe addiction.\n\nDiagnosis\nIn addition to a preoccupation with using and\nacquiring the abused substance, the diagnosis of\naddiction is based on five criteria:\n\u0002\n\nloss of willpower\n\n\u0002\n\nharmful consequences\n\n\u0002\n\nunmanageable lifestyle\n\n\u0002\n\ntolerance or escalation of use\n\n\u0002\n\nwithdrawal symptoms upon quitting\n\ngroup psychotherapy is often helpful, but only after\nsubstance use has stopped.

In 2004, clinical trials were testing a number of\ndrugs currently in use for other diseases and conditions to see if they could be used to treat addiction.\nThis would speed up their approval by the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA). For example,\ncocaine withdrawal is eased by boosting dopamine\nlevels in the brain, so scientists are studying drugs\nthat boost dopamine, such as Ritalin, which is used\nto treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and\namantadine, a drug used for flu and Parkinson\u2019s\ndiease.\nThe most frequently recommended social form of\noutpatient treatment is the twelve-step program.

This results in decreased production\nof two important chemicals (hormones) normally\nreleased by the adrenal cortex: cortisol and\naldosterone.\n\nDescription\nThe adrenals are two glands, each perched on the\nupper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of the\ngland is known as the cortex; the inner part is known\nas the medulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal\ngland is responsible for producing different types of\nhormones.\nCortisol is a very potent hormone produced by the\nadrenal cortex. It is involved in regulating the functioning of nearly every type of organ and tissue\nthroughout the body, and is considered to be one of\nthe few hormones absolutely necessary for life.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

When\nthis balance is upset, the volume of blood circulating\nthroughout the body will fall dangerously low, accompanied by a drop in blood pressure.\nAddison\u2019s disease is also called primary adrenocortical insufficiency. In other words, some process\ninterferes directly with the ability of the adrenal cortex\nto produce its hormones. Levels of both cortisol and\naldosterone drop, and numerous functions throughout the body are disrupted.\nAddison\u2019s disease occurs in about four in every\n100,000 people. It strikes both men and women of all\nages.\n\nCauses and symptoms\nThe most common cause of Addison\u2019s disease is\nthe destruction and/or shrinking (atrophy) of the adrenal cortex. In about 70% of all cases, this atrophy is\nbelieved to occur due to an autoimmune disorder. In an\nautoimmune disorder, the immune system of the body,\nresponsible for identifying foreign invaders such as\nviruses or bacteria and killing them, accidentally begins\nto identify the cells of the adrenal cortex as foreign,\nand destroy them. In about 20% of all cases, destruction of the adrenal cortex is caused by tuberculosis. The\nremaining cases of Addison\u2019s disease may be caused\nby fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, and cryptococcosis, which affect the adrenal\ngland by producing destructive, tumor-like masses\ncalled granulomas; a disease called amyloidosis, in\nwhich a starchy substance called amyloid is deposited\nin abnormal places throughout the body, interfering\nwith the function of whatever structure it is present\nwithin; or invasion of the adrenal glands by cancer.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

In\nthis disorder cells from the back surface of the cornea\nof the eye spread over the surface of the iris and the\ntissue that drains the eye, forming adhesions that bind\nthe iris to the cornea and causing further blockage of\nthe drainage channels. This blockage increases the\npressure inside the eye, which may damage the optic\nnerve. ICE syndrome occurs most often in lightskinned females.\n\nCauses and symptoms\nPost-surgical adhesions\nCommon causes of postoperative adhesions\ninclude:\n\u0002\n\nabdominal surgery\n\n\u0002\n\ngynecological surgery\n\n\u0002\n\nthoracic surgery\n\n\u0002\n\northopedic surgery\n\n\u0002\n\nplastic surgery.\n\nAbdominal adhesions most often result from surgeries in which the organs are handled or temporarily\nmoved. Intrauterine adhesions form after surgeries\ninvolving the uterus, particularly curettage\u2014the\nscraping of the uterine contents. Surgery to control\nuterine bleeding after giving birth also can lead to\nintrauterine adhesions. Such adhesions can cause\nAsherman\u2019s syndrome, closing the uterus and preventing menstruation.\nOther causes of adhesions\nAny inflammation or infection of the membranes\nthat line the abdominal and pelvic walls and enclose\n62\n\nthe organs\u2014the peritoneum\u2014can cause adhesions.\nAn example peritonitis, a severe infection that can\nresult from appendicitis, may lead to adhesions. In\naddition to surgery or injury, pelvic adhesions can be\ncaused by inflammation resulting from an infection\nsuch as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).\nSymptoms\nIn the majority of people adhesions do not cause\nsymptoms or serious problems. However in some people adhesions can lead to a variety of disorders. The\nsymptoms depend on the type of adhesion and the\ntissues that are involved.

A cancer in the adrenal medulla is\ncalled a pheochromocytoma and can cause high blood\npressure, headache, palpitations, and excessive perspiration. Although these cancers can happen at any\nage, most occur in young adults.\n\nCauses and symptoms\nIt is not known what causes adrenal gland cancer,\nbut some cases are associated with hereditary diseases.\nSymptoms of adrenal cancer are related to the specific\nhormones produced by that tumor. An adrenocortical\ncarcinoma typically secretes high amounts of cortisol,\nproducing Cushing\u2019s Syndrome. This syndrome produces progressive weight gain, rounding of the face,\nand increased blood pressure. Women can experience\nmenstrual cycle alterations and men can experience\nfeminization. The symptoms for pheochromocytoma\ninclude hypertension, acidosis, unexplained fever and\nweight loss. Because of the hormones produced by this\ntype of tumor, anxiety is often a feature also.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nBOOKS\n\nLuther, Suniya G., Jacob A.

Adrenalectomy is usually performed by conventional (open) surgery, but in selected patients surgeons may use laparoscopy. With laparoscopy,\nadrenalectomy can be accomplished through four\nvery small incisions.\n\nPurpose\nAdrenalectomy is usually advised for patients\nwith tumors of the adrenal glands. Adrenal gland\ntumors may be malignant or benign, but all typically\nexcrete excessive amounts of one or more hormones. A\nsuccessful procedure will aid in correcting hormone\nimbalances, and may also remove cancerous tumors\nthat can invade other parts of the body. Occasionally,\nadrenalectomy may be recommended when hormones\n69\n\nAdrenalectomy\n\nWomen with adrenal virilization may develop\nfacial hair. Typically, their menstrual cycles are infrequent or absent. They may also develop a deeper\nvoice, a more prominent Adam\u2019s apple, and other\nmasculine signs.\n\n\fAdrenalectomy\n\nproduced by the adrenal glands aggravate another\ncondition such as breast cancer.\n\nPrecautions\nThe adrenal glands are fed by numerous blood\nvessels, so surgeons need to be alert to extensive bleeding during surgery. In addition, the adrenal glands lie\nclose to one of the body\u2019s major blood vessels (the\nvena cava), and to the spleen and the pancreas. The\nsurgeon needs to remove the gland(s) without damaging any of these important and delicate organs.\n\nDescription\nOpen adrenalectomy\nThe surgeon may operate from any of four directions, depending on the exact problem and the\npatient\u2019s body type.\nIn the anterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the\nabdominal wall. Usually the incision will be horizontal, just under the rib cage. If the surgeon intends to\noperate on only one of the adrenal glands, the incision\nwill run under just the right or the left side of the rib\ncage. Sometimes a vertical incision in the middle of the\nabdomen provides a better approach, especially if\nboth adrenal glands are involved.\nIn the posterior approach, the surgeon cuts into\nthe back, just beneath the rib cage.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

In addition, hormone imbalances are often a major challenge. Whenever possible,\nphysicians will try to correct hormone imbalances\nthrough medication in the days or weeks before surgery. Adrenal tumors may cause other problems such\nas hypertension or inadequate potassium in the blood,\nand these problems also should be resolved if possible\nbefore surgery is performed. Therefore, a patient may\ntake specific medicines for days or weeks before\nsurgery.\nMost adrenal tumors can be imaged very well with\na CT scan or MRI, and benign tumors tend to look\ndifferent on these tests than do cancerous tumors.\nSurgeons may order a CT scan, MRI, or scintigraphy\n(viewing of the location of a tiny amount of radioactive agent) to help locate exactly where the tumor is.\nThe day before surgery, patients will probably\nhave an enema to clear the bowels. In patients with\nlung problems or clotting problems, physicians may\nadvise special preparations.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\n\fPatients stay in the hospital for various lengths of\ntime after adrenalectomy. The longest hospital stays\nare required for open surgery using an anterior\napproach; hospital stays of about three days are indicated for open surgery using the posterior approach or\nfor laparoscopic adrenalectomy.\nThe special concern after adrenalectomy is the\npatient\u2019s hormone balance. There may be several sets\nof lab tests to define hormone problems and monitor\nthe results of drug treatment. In addition, blood pressure problems and infections are more common after\nremoval of certain types of adrenal tumors.\nAs with most open surgery, surgeons are also\nconcerned about blood clots forming in the legs and\ntraveling to the lungs (venous thromboembolism),\nbowel problems, and postoperative pain.

There are three\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\n\fThe adult-onset form of the disease, also called\nadrenomyeloneuropathy, is milder, progresses slowly,\nis usually associated with a normal life span, and\nusually appears between ages 21-35. Symptoms may\ninclude progressive stiffness, weakness, or paralysis of\nthe lower limbs and loss of coordination. Brain function deterioration may also been seen. Women who\nare carriers of the disease occasionally experience the\nsame symptoms, as well as others, including ataxia,\nhypertonia (excessive muscle tone), mild peripheral\nneuropathy, and urinary problems. The neonatal\nform affects both male and female infants and may\nproduce mental retardation, facial abnormalities, seizures, retinal degeneration, poor muscle tone,\nenlarged liver, and adrenal dysfunction. Neonatal\nALD usually progresses rapidly.\n\nCauses and symptoms\nThe genetic defect in ALD causes a decrease in the\nability to degrade very long chain fatty acids. These\nbuild up in the adrenal glands, brain, plasma, and\nfibroblasts. The build-up of very long chain fatty\nacids interferes with the ability of the adrenal gland\nto convert cholesterol into steroids and causes demyelination of nerves in the white matter of the brain.\nDemyelinated nerve cells are unable to function\nproperly.\n\nKEY TERMS\nAmniocentesis\u2014The collection of amniotic fluid\nthrough a needle inserted through the abdomen.\nUsed to collect fetal cells for genetic analysis.\nAtaxia\u2014Loss of coordination of muscular movement.\nHypertonia\u2014Having excessive muscular tone.\nMyelin\u2014A layer that encloses nerve cells and some\naxons and is made largely of lipids and lipoproteins.\nNeuropathy\u2014A disease or abnormality of the peripheral nerves.\n\nTreatment\nTreatment for all forms of ALD consists of treating the symptoms and supporting the patient with\nphysical therapy, psychological counseling, and special education in some cases. There is no cure for this\ndisease, and there are no drugs that can reverse demyelination of nerve and brain cells. Dietary measures\nconsist of reducing the intake of foods high in fat,\nwhich are a source of very long chain fatty acids.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

The biochemical test detects elevated levels of very long chain fatty\nacids in samples from amniocentesis, chorionic villi,\nplasma, red blood cells, or fibroblasts.

ARDS is not itself a specific disease, but a\nsyndrome, a group of symptoms and signs that\nmake up one of the most important forms of lung or\nrespiratory failure. It can develop quite suddenly in\npersons whose lungs have been perfectly normal.\nVery often ARDS is a true medical emergency. The\nbasic fault is a breakdown of the barrier, or membrane, that normally keeps fluid from leaking out of\nthe small blood vessels of the lung into the breathing\nsacs (the alveoli).\n\nCapillaries\u2014The smallest arteries which, in the\nlung, are located next to the alveoli so that they\ncan pick up oxygen from inhaled air.\nFace mask\u2014The simplest way of delivering a high\nlevel of oxygen to patients with ARDS or other lowoxygen conditions.\nSteroids\u2014A class of drugs resembling normal body\nsubstances that often help control inflammation in\nthe body tissues.\nVentilator\u2014A mechanical device that can take\nover the work of breathing for a patient whose\nlungs are injured or are starting to heal.\n\nDescription\nAnother name for ARDS is shock lung. Its formal\nname is misleading, because children, as well as adults,\nmay be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood vessels, or capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny\nair sacs at the tips of the smallest breathing tubes (the\nbronchi). This is the all-important site where oxygen\npasses from air that is inhaled to the blood, which\ncarries it to all parts of the body.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

The result is the type of breathing distress called ARDS. ARDS is one of the major\ncauses of excess fluid in the lungs, the other being heart\nfailure.\nAlong with fluid there is a marked increase in\ninflamed cells in the lungs. There also is debris left\nover from damaged lung cells, and fibrin, a semisolid material derived from blood in the tissues.\nTypically these materials join together with large\nmolecules in the blood (proteins), to form hyaline\nmembranes. (These membranes are very prominent\nin premature infants who develop respiratory distress\nsyndrome; it is often called hyaline membrane disease.) If ARDS is very severe or lasts a long time, the\nlungs do not heal, but rather become scarred, a process\nknown as fibrosis. The lack of a normal amount of\noxygen causes the blood vessels of the lung to become\nnarrower, and in time they, too, may become scarred\nand filled with clotted blood. The lungs as a whole\nbecome very \u2018\u2018stiff,\u2019\u2019 and it becomes much harder for\nthe patient to breathe.\n74\n\nCauses and symptoms\nA very wide range of diseases or toxic substances,\nincluding some drugs, can cause ARDS.

This treatment must be closely supervised, and\nthe pressure adjusted so that too much oxygen is not\ndelivered.\n\nPatients with ARDS should be cared for in an\nintensive care unit, where experienced staff and all\nneeded equipment are available. Enough fluid must\nbe provided, by vein if necessary, to prevent dehydration. Also, the patient\u2019s nutritional state must be maintained, again by vein, if oral intake is not sufficient.\n\nPrognosis\nIf the patient\u2019s lung injury does not soon begin to\nheal, the lack of sufficient oxygen can injure other\norgans, such as the kidneys. There always is a risk\nthat bacterial pneumonia will develop at some point.\nWithout prompt treatment, as many as 90% of\npatients with ARDS can be expected to die. With\nmodern treatment, however, about half of all patients\nwill survive. Those who do live usually recover completely, with little or no long-term breathing difficulty.\nLung scarring is a risk after a long period on a ventilator, but it may improve in the months after the\npatient is taken off ventilation. Whether a particular\npatient will recover depends to a great extent on\nwhether the primary disease that caused ARDS to\ndevelop in the first place can be effectively treated.\n\nPrevention\nThe only way to prevent ARDS is to avoid those\ndiseases and harmful conditions that damage the lung.\nFor instance, the danger of aspirating stomach contents into the lungs can be avoided by making sure a\npatient does not eat shortly before receiving general\nanesthesia. If a patient needs oxygen therapy, as low a\nlevel as possible should be given.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

During the latter half of\nlife, an individual is more prone to have problems with\nthe various functions of the body and to develop any\nnumber of chronic or fatal diseases.

The most\ncommon diseases of aging include Alzheimer\u2019s, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, depression, and heart disease.\n\nDescription\nHuman beings reach a peak of growth and development around the time of their mid 20s.

People with phobias feel dread or panic\nwhen they face certain objects, situations, or activities.\nPeople with agoraphobia frequently also experience\npanic attacks, but panic attacks, or panic disorder,\nare not a requirement for a diagnosis of agoraphobia.\nThe defining feature of agoraphobia is anxiety about\nbeing in places from which escape might be embarrasing or difficult, or in which help might be unavailable.\nThe person suffering from agoraphobia usually avoids\nthe anxiety-provoking situation and may become\ntotally housebound.\n\nCauses and symptoms\nAgoraphobia is the most common type of phobia,\nand it is estimated to affect between 5-12% of\nAmericans within their lifetime. Agoraphobia is\ntwice as common in women as in men and usually\nstrikes between the ages of 15-35.\nThe symptoms of the panic attacks which may\naccompany agoraphobia vary from person to person,\nand may include trembling, sweating, heart palpitations (a feeling of the heart pounding against the\nchest), jitters, fatigue, tingling in the hands and feet,\nnausea, a rapid pulse or breathing rate, and a sense of\nimpending doom.\nAgoraphobia and other phobias are thought to be\nthe result of a number of physical and environmental\nfactors.

The doctor can\ndiagnose the underlying panic or anxiety disorder\nand make sure the symptoms aren\u2019t related to some\nother underlying medical condition.\nThe doctor makes the diagnosis of agoraphobia\nbased primarily on the patient\u2019s description of his or\nher symptoms. The person with agoraphobia experiences anxiety in situations where escape is difficult or\nhelp is unavailable\u2013or in certain situations, such as\nbeing alone. While many people are somewhat apprehensive in these situations, the hallmark of agoraphobia is that a person\u2019s active avoidance of the feared\nsituation impairs his or her ability to work, socialize,\nor otherwise function.\n\nTreatment\nTreatment for agoraphobia usually consists of\nboth medication and psychotherapy. Usually,\npatients can benefit from certain antidepressants,\nsuch as amitriptyline (Elavil), or selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors, such as paroxetine (Paxil),\nfluoxetine (Prozac), or sertraline (Zoloft). In addition, patients may manage panic attacks in progress\nwith certain tranquilizers called benzodiazepines,\nsuch as alprazolam (Xanax) or clonazepam\n(Klonipin).\nThe mainstay of treatment for agoraphobia and\nother phobias is cognitive behavioral therapy. A\nspecific technique that is often employed is called\ndesensitization. The patient is gradually exposed to\nthe situation that usually triggers fear and avoidance,\nand, with the help of breathing or relaxation techniques, learns to cope with the situation. This helps\nbreak the mental connection between the situation and\nthe fear, anxiety, or panic. Patients may also benefit\nfrom psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy,\ndiscussing underlying emotional conflicts with a therapist or support group.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

After the virus has\nattached to the CD4 receptor, the virus-CD4 complex\nrefolds to uncover another receptor called a chemokine receptor that helps to mediate entry of the virus\ninto the cell.

Some AIDS tests also can be\nused to screen blood donations for safe use in\ntransfusions.\nIn order to understand the different purposes\nof the blood tests used with AIDS patients, it is helpful to understand how HIV infection affects human\nblood and the immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that\nenters the blood stream of a new host in the following\nways:\n\u0002\n\nby sexual contact\n\n\u0002\n\nby contact with infected body fluids (such as blood\nand urine)\n\n\u0002\n\nby transmission during pregnancy, or\n\n\u0002\n\nthrough transfusion of infected blood products\n\nA retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique\nenzyme called reverse transcriptase that allows it to\nreplicate within new host cells. The virus binds to a\nprotein called CD4, which is found on the surface of\ncertain subtypes of white blood cells, including helper\nT cells, macrophages, and monocytes. Once HIV\nenters the cell, it can replicate and kill the cell in\nways that are still not completely understood. In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly, the AIDS\nvirus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CD4\ncells. CD4 cells ordinarily produce a substance called\ninterleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulates other cells\n(T cells and B cells) in the human immune system\nto respond to infections. Without the IL-2, T cells do\nnot reproduce as they normally would in response to the\nHIV virus, and B cells are not stimulated to respond\nto the infection.\n\nPrecautions\nIn some states such as New York, a signed consent\nform is needed in order to administer an AIDS test. As\nwith all blood tests, healthcare professionals should\nalways wear latex gloves and avoid being pricked by\nthe needle used in drawing blood for the tests.

A white blood cell count that is\nbroken down into categories in this way is called a\nWBC differential.\n\nIt is important for doctors treating AIDS patients\nto measure the lymphocyte count on a regular basis.\nExperts consulted by the United States Public Health\nService recommend the following frequency of serum\ntesting based on the patient\u2019s CD4+ level:\nCD4+ count more than 600 cells/mm3: Every six\nmonths.\n\n\u0002\n\nCD4+ count between 200-600 cells/mm3: Every\nthree months.\n\n\u0002\n\nCD4+ count less than 200 cells/mm3: Every three\nmonths.\n\n\u0002\n\nWhen the CD4+ count falls below 200 cells/mm3,\nthe doctor will put the patient on a medication regimen to protect him or her against opportunistic\ninfections.\nHIV VIRAL LOAD TESTS.

However, the severity of the liver\ndamage is not necessarily shown by the ALT test, since\nthe amount of dead liver tissue does not correspond to\nhigher ALT levels. Also, patients with normal, or\ndeclining, ALT levels may experience serious liver\ndamage without an increase in ALT.\nNevertheless, ALT is widely used, and useful,\nbecause ALT levels are elevated in most patients with\nliver disease. Although ALT levels do not necessarily\nindicate the severity of the damage to the liver, they\nmay indicate how much of the liver has been damaged.\nALT levels, when compared to the levels of a similar\nenzyme, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), may provide important clues to the nature of the liver disease.\nFor example, within a certain range of values, a ratio\nof 2:1 or greater for AST: ALT might indicate that a\npatient suffers from alcoholic liver disease.

Many types of\nalbinism exist, all of which involve lack of pigment in\nvarying degrees. The condition, which is found in all\nraces, may be accompanied by eye problems and may\nlead to skin cancer later in life.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\nAlbinism is a rare disorder found in fewer than\nfive people per 100,000 in the United States and\nEurope. Other parts of the world have a much higher\nrate; for example, albinism is found in about 20 out of\nevery 100,000 people in southern Nigeria.\nThere are 10 types of the most common form of the\ncondition, known as \u2018\u2018oculocutaneous albinism,\u2019\u2019 which\naffects the eyes, hair, and skin. In its most severe form,\nhair and skin remain pure white throughout life. People\nwith a less severe form are born with white hair and skin,\nwhich turn slightly darker as they age.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

There may be other eye problems as well, including poor vision and crossed or \u2018\u2018lazy\u2019\u2019 eyes (strabismus).\nThe second most common type of the condition is\nknown as \u2018\u2018ocular\u2019\u2019 albinism, in which only the eyes\nlack color; skin and hair are normal. There are five\nforms of ocular albinism; some types cause more problems\u2013especially eye problems\u2013than others.\n\nCauses and symptoms\nEvery cell in the body contains a matched pair of\ngenes, one inherited from each parent. These genes act\nas a sort of \u2018\u2018blueprint\u2019\u2019 that guides the development of\na fetus.\nAlbinism is an inherited problem caused by a flaw\nin one or more of the genes that are responsible for\ndirecting the eyes and skin to make melanin (pigment).\nAs a result, little or no pigment is made, and the child\u2019s\nskin, eyes and hair may be colorless.\nIn most types of albinism, a recessive trait, the\nchild inherits flawed genes for making melanin from\nboth parents. Because the task of making melanin is\ncomplex, there are many different types of albinism,\ninvolving a number of different genes.\nIt\u2019s also possible to inherit one normal gene and\none albinism gene. In this case, the one normal gene\nprovides enough information in its cellular blueprint\nto make some pigment, and the child will have normal\nskin and eye color. They \u2018\u2018carry\u2019\u2019 one gene for albinism. About one in 70 people are albinism carriers, with\none flawed gene but no symptoms; they have a 50%\nchance of passing the albinism gene to their child.\nHowever, if both parents are carriers with one flawed\ngene each, they have a 1 in 4 chance of passing on both\ncopies of the flawed gene to the child, who will have\nalbinism.

People with\nalbinism may experience some social problems\nbecause of a lack of understanding on the part of\nothers. When a member of a normally dark-skinned\nethnic group has albinism, he or she may face some\nvery complex social challenges.\nOne of the greatest health hazards for people with\nalbinism is excessive exposure to sun without protection, which could lead to skin cancer. Wearing opaque\nclothes and sunscreen rated SPF 20, people with albinism can safely work and play outdoors safely even\nduring the summer.\n\nI Alcohol-related\nneurologic\ndisease\nDefinition\nAlcohol, or ethanol, is a poison with direct toxic\neffects on nerve and muscle cells. Depending on\nwhich nerve and muscle pathways are involved,\nalcohol can have far-reaching effects on different\nparts of the brain, peripheral nerves, and muscles,\nwith symptoms of memory loss, incoordination,\nseizures, weakness, and sensory deficits. These different effects can be grouped into three main categories:\n(1) intoxication due to the acute effects of ethanol, (2)\nwithdrawal syndrome from suddenly stopping drinking, and (3) disorders related to long-term or chronic\nalcohol abuse. Alcohol-related neurologic disease\nincludes Wernicke-Korsakoff disease, alcoholic\ncerebellar degeneration, alcoholic myopathy, alcoholic neuropathy, alcohol withdrawal syndrome\nwith seizures and delirium tremens, and fetal alcohol\nsyndrome.\n\nDescription\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling is very important to prevent\nfurther occurrences of the conditon.\nResources\nBOOKS\n\nNational Association for the Visually Handicapped.

Because not enough sugar is available to supply needed energy, muscle protein may be broken\ndown as an alternate energy source. However, toxic\neffects on muscle may be a direct result of alcohol itself\nrather than of its breakdown products.\nAlthough alcoholic peripheral neuropathy may\ncontribute to muscle weakness and atrophy by injuring the motor nerves controlling muscle movement,\nalcoholic neuropathy more commonly affects sensory\nfibers. Injury to these fibers can cause tingling or burning pain in the feet, which may be severe enough to\ninterfere with walking. As the condition worsens, pain\ndecreases but numbness increases.\n\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of alcohol-related neurologic disease depends largely on finding characteristic symptoms and signs in patients who abuse alcohol. Other\npossible causes should be excluded by the appropriate\ntests, which may include blood chemistry, thyroid\nfunction tests, brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography scan), and/or\ncerebrospinal fluid analysis.\nAcute alcoholic myopathy can be diagnosed\nby finding myoglobin in the urine and increased\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\n\fTreatment\nAcute management of alcohol intoxication, delirium tremens, and withdrawal is primarily supportive,\nto monitor and treat any cardiovascular or respiratory\nfailure that may develop. In delirium tremens, fever\nand sweating may necessitate treatment of fluid loss\nand secondary low blood pressure. Agitation may be\ntreated with benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide,\nbeta-adrenergic antagonists such as atenolol, or alpha\n2-adrenergic agonists such as clonidine. Because\nWernicke\u2019s syndrome is rapidly reversible with thiamine, and because death may intervene if thiamine is\nnot given promptly, all patients admitted for acute\ncomplications of alcohol, as well as all patients with\nunexplained encephalopathy, should be given intravenous thiamine.\nWithdrawal seizures typically resolve without\nspecific anti-epileptic drug treatment, although status\nepilepticus (continual seizures occurring without interruption) should be treated vigorously.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

The\nblood-brain barrier does not prevent alcohol from\nentering the brain, so the brain alcohol level will quickly\nbecome equivalent to the blood alcohol level. Alcohol\u2019s\ndepressive effects result in difficulty walking, poor balance, slurring of speech, and generally poor coordination (accounting in part for the increased likelihood of\ninjury). The affected person also may have impairment\nof peripheral vision. At higher alcohol levels, a person\u2019s\nbreathing and heart rates will be slowed, and vomiting\nmay occur (with a high risk of the vomit being breathed\ninto the lungs, resulting in severe problems, including\nthe possibility of pneumonia).

The first\nstep in the treatment of alcoholism, called detoxification, involves helping the person stop drinking and\nridding his or her body of the harmful (toxic) effects\nof alcohol. Because the person\u2019s body has become\naccustomed to alcohol, the person will need to be\nsupported through withdrawal. Withdrawal will be\ndifferent for different patients, depending on the severity of the alcoholism, as measured by the quantity of\nalcohol ingested daily and the length of time the\npatient has been an alcoholic. Withdrawal symptoms\ncan range from mild to life-threatening. Mild withdrawal symptoms include nausea, achiness, diarrhea,\ndifficulty sleeping, sweatiness, anxiety, and trembling.\nThis phase is usually over in about three to five days.\nMore severe effects of withdrawal can include hallucinations (in which a patient sees, hears, or feels something that is not actually real), seizures, an unbearable\ncraving for more alcohol, confusion, fever, fast heart\nrate, high blood pressure, and delirium (a fluctuating\nlevel of consciousness). Patients at highest risk for the\nmost severe symptoms of withdrawal (referred to as\ndelirium tremens) are those with other medical\nproblems, including malnutrition, liver disease, or\nWernicke\u2019s syndrome. Delirium tremens usually\nbegin about three to five days after the patient\u2019s last\ndrink, progressing from the more mild symptoms to\nthe more severe, and may last a number of days.\nPatients going through only mild withdrawal are\nsimply monitored carefully to make sure that more\nsevere symptoms do not develop. No medications are\nnecessary, however. Treatment of a patient suffering\nthe more severe effects of withdrawal may require the\nuse of sedative medications to relieve the discomfort of\nwithdrawal and to avoid the potentially life-threatening complications of high blood pressure, fast heart\nrate, and seizures.

Because many alcoholics\nhave very stressful lives (whether because of or leading to the alcoholism is sometimes a matter of\ndebate), many of the treatments for alcoholism\ninvolve dealing with and relieving stress. These\ninclude massage, meditation, and hypnotherapy. The\nmalnutrition of long-term alcohol use is addressed by\nnutrition-oriented practitioners with careful attention to a healthy diet and the use of nutritional supplements such as vitamins A, B complex, and C, as\nwell as certain fatty acids, amino acids, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. Herbal treatments include milk\nthistle (Silybum marianum), which is thought to protect the liver against damage. Other herbs are thought\nto be helpful for the patient suffering through withdrawal. Some of these include lavender (Lavandula\nofficinalis), skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora), chamomile (Matricaria recutita), peppermint (Mentha\npiperita) yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and valerian\n(Valeriana officinalis).

Aldosterone regulates the\namounts of sodium and potassium in the blood. This\nhelps maintain water balance and blood volume,\nwhich, in turn, affects blood pressure.\n\nPurpose\nAldosterone measurement is useful in detecting a\ncondition called aldosteronism, which is caused by\nexcess secretion of the hormone from the adrenal\nglands. There are two types of aldosteronism: primary\nand secondary. Primary aldosteronism is most commonly caused by an adrenal tumor, as in Conn\u2019s\nsyndrome. Idiopathic (of unknown cause) hyperaldosteronism is another type of primary aldosteronism.\nSecondary aldosteronism is more common and may\noccur with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis with fluid\nin the abdominal cavity (ascites), certain kidney diseases, excess potassium, sodium-depleted diet, and\ntoxemia of pregnancy.\nTo differentiate primary aldosteronism from secondary aldosteronism, a plasma renin test should be\nperformed at the same time as the aldosterone assay.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

It specifically binds CD52, a protein\nfound on the surface of essentially all B and T cells of\nthe immune system. By binding the CD52 protein on\nthe malignant B cells, the antibody targets it for\nremoval from the circulation. Scientists believe that\nalemtuzumab triggers antibody-mediated lysis of the\nB cells, a method that the immune system uses to\neliminate foreign cells.\nAlemtuzumab has been approved by the FDA for\ntreatment of refractory B-CLL. For a patient\u2019s disease\nto be classified as refractory, both alkylating agents\nand fludarabine treatment must have been tried and\nfailed. Thus, this drug gives patients who have tried all\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\n\fAlkylating agent\u2014A chemical that alters the composition of the genetic material of rapidly dividing cells,\nsuch as cancer cells, causing selective cell death;\nused as a chemotherapeutic agent to treat B-CLL.\nAntibody\u2014A protective protein made by the\nimmune system in response to an antigen, also\ncalled an immunoglobulin.\nAutoimmune\u2014An immune reaction of a patient\nagainst their own cells.\nHumanization\u2014Fusing the constant and variable\nframework region of one or more human immunoglobulins with the binding region of an animal\nimmunoglobulin, done to reduce human reaction\nagainst the fusion antibody.\nMonoclonal\u2014Genetically engineered antibodies\nspecific for one antigen.\nTumor lysis syndrome\u2014A side effect of some immunotherapies, like monoclonal antibodies, that lyse\nthe tumor cells, due to the toxicity of flooding the\nbloodstream with such a quantity of cellular contents.\n\napproved treatments for B-CLL another option.

There is also a clinical trial ongoing\nto test the ability of this antibody to prevent rejection\nin kidney transplantation.\n\nDescription\nAlemtuzumab is produced in the laboratory using\ngenetically engineered single clones of B-cells. Like all\nantibodies, it is a Y-shaped molecule can bind one\nparticular substance, the antigen for that monoclonal\nantibody. For alemtuzumab, the antigen is CD52, a\nprotein found on the surface of normal and malignant\nB and T cells as well as other cells of the immune and\nmale reproductive systems. Alemtuzumab is a humanized antibody, meaning that the regions that bind\nCD52, located on the tips of the Y branches, are\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\nderived from rat antibodies, but the rest of the antibody is human sequence. The presence of the human\nsequences helps to reduce the immune response by the\npatient against the antibody itself, a problem seen\nwhen complete mouse antibodies are used for cancer\ntherapies. The human sequences also help to ensure\nthat the various cell-destroying mechanisms of the\nhuman immune system are properly triggered with\nbinding of the antibody.\nAlemtuzumab was approved in May of 2001 for the\ntreatment of refractory B-CLL. It is approved for use\nalone but clinical trials have tested the ability of the antibody to be used in combination with the purine analogs\npentostatin, fludarabine, and cladribine, and rituximab,\na monoclonal antibody specific for the CD20 antigen,\nanother protein found on the surface of B cells.\n\nRecommended dosage\nThis antibody should be administered in a gradually escalating pattern at the start of treatment and any\ntime administration is interrupted for seven or more\ndays. The recommended beginning dosage for B-CLL\npatients is a daily dose of 3 mg of Campath administered as a two-hour IV infusion. Once this amount is\ntolerated, the dose is increased to 10 mg per day. After\ntolerating this dose, it can be increased to 30 mg, administered three days a week.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Specifically, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole\n(to prevent bacterial infections) and famciclovir (to prevent viral infections) were used during the clinical trial to\ndecrease infections, although they were not eliminated.\n\nPrecautions\nBlood studies should be done on a weekly basis while\npatients are receiving the alemtuzumab treatment.\nVaccination during the treatment session is not recommended, given the T cell depletion that occurs during\ntreatment. Furthermore, given that antibodies like alumtuzumab can pass through the placenta to the developing\nfetus and in breast milk, use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended unless clearly needed.\n\nSide effects\nA severe side effect of alemtuzumab treatment is\nthe possible depletion of one or more types of blood\n109\n\nAlemtuzumab\n\nKEY TERMS\n\n\fAlexander technique\n\ncells. Because CD52 is expressed on a patient\u2019s normal\nB and T cells, as well as on the surface of the abnormal\nB cells, the treatment eliminates both normal and\ncancerous cells. The treatment also seems to trigger\nautoimmune reactions against various other blood\ncells. This results in severe reduction of the many\ncirculating blood cells including red blood cells (anemia), white blood cells (neutropenia), and clotting cells\n(thrombopenia). These conditions are treated with\nblood transfusions. The great majority of patients\ntreated exhibit some type of blood cell depletion.\nA second serious side effect of this drug is the\nprevalence of opportunistic infections that occurs during the treatment. Serious, and sometimes fatal bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoan infections have\nbeen reported. Treatments to prevent pneumonia and\nherpes infections reduce, but do not eliminate these\ninfections.\nThe majority of other side effects occur after or\nduring the first infusion of the drug.

He became an actor and\nShakespearean reciter, and early in his career he\nbegan to suffer from strain on his vocal chords. He\nsought medical attention for chronic hoarseness, but\nafter treatment with a recommended prescription and\nextensive periods of rest, his problem persisted.\nAlexander realized that his hoarseness began\nabout an hour into a dramatic performance and\nreasoned that it was something he did in the process\nof reciting that caused him to lose his voice. Returning\nto his medical doctor, Alexander told him of his\nobservation. When the doctor admitted that he\ndidn\u2019t know what Alexander was doing to injure\nhis vocal chords, Alexander decided to try and find\nout for himself.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\n\fDirection\u2014Bringing about the free balance of the\nhead on the spine and the resulting release of the\nerector muscles of the back and legs which establish improved coordination.\nHabit\u2014Referring to the particular set of physical\nand mental tensions present in any individual.\nInhibition\u2014Referring to the moment in an\nAlexander lesson when the student refrains from\nbeginning a movement in order to avoid tensing\nof the muscles.\nSensory awareness\u2014Bringing attention to the sensations of tension and/or release in the muscles.\n\nThus began a decade of self-observation and discovery. Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself in\nthe act of reciting, normal speaking, and later standing,\nwalking, and sitting, Alexander managed to improve\nhis coordination and to overcome his vocal problems.\nOne of his most startling discoveries was that in order to\nchange the way he used his body he had to change the\nway he was thinking, redirecting his thoughts in such a\nway that he did not produce unnecessary tension\nwhen he attempted speech or movement. After making\nthis discovery at the end of the nineteenth century,\nAlexander became a pioneer in body-mind medicine.\nAt first, performers and dancers sought guidance\nfrom Alexander to overcome physical complaints and\nto improve the expression and spontaneity of their\nperformances.

Introductory workshops or\nworkshops for special applications of the technique\n(e.g.,workshops for musicians) are also common.\nPrivate lessons range from a half-hour to an hour in\nlength, and are taught in a series. The number of lessons\nvaries according to the severity of the student\u2019s difficulties with coordination or to the extent of the student\u2019s\ninterest in pursuing the improvements made possible by\ncontinued study. The cost of lessons ranges from $40-80\nper hour. Insurance coverage is not widely available,\nbut discounts are available for participants in some\ncomplementary care insurance plans. Pre-tax Flexible\nSpending Accounts for health care cover Alexander\ntechnique lessons if they are prescribed by a physician.\nIn lessons teachers guide students through simple\nmovements (while students are dressed in comfortable\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\nclothing) and use their hands to help students identify\nand stop destructive patterns of tension. Tensing\narises from mental processes as well as physical, so\ndiscussions of personal reactions or behavior are likely\nto arise in the course of a lesson.\nThe technique helps students move with ease and\nimproved coordination. At the beginning of a movement (the lessons are a series of movements), most people pull back their heads, raise their shoulders toward\ntheir ears, over-arch their lower backs, tighten their legs,\nand otherwise produce excessive tension in their bodies.\nAlexander referred to this as misuse of the body.\nAt any point in a movement, proper use can be\nestablished. If the neck muscles are not over-tensed,\nthe head will carry slightly forward of the spine, simply\nbecause it is heavier in the front. When the head is out\nof balance in the forward direction, it sets off a series\nof stretch reflexes in the extensor muscles of the back.\nIt is skillful use of these reflexes, along with reflex\nactivity in the feet and legs, the arms and hands, the\nbreathing mechanism, and other parts of the body,\nthat lessons in the technique aim to develop.\nAlexander found that optimal functioning of the\nbody was very hard to maintain, even for the short\nperiod of time it took to complete a single movement.\nPeople, especially adults, have very strong tension\nhabits associated with movement. Chronic misuse of\nthe muscles is common.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

It may be caused by slouching\nin front of televisions or video monitors, too much\nsitting or driving and too little walking, or by tension\nassociated with past traumas and injuries. Stiffening\nthe neck after a whiplash injury or favoring a broken or\nsprained leg long after it has healed are examples of\nhabitual tension caused by injury.\nThe first thing a teacher of the Alexander technique does is to increase a student\u2019s sensory awareness\nof this excessive habitual tension, particularly that in\nthe neck and spine. Next the student is taught to\ninhibit the tension. If the student prepares to sit\ndown, for example, he will tense his muscles in his\nhabitual way. If he is asked to put aside the intention\nto sit and instead to free his neck and allow less constriction in his muscles, he can begin to change his\ntense habitual response to sitting.\nBy leaving the head resting on the spine in its\nnatural free balance, by keeping eyes open and\nfocused, not held in a tense stare, by allowing the\nshoulders to release, the knees to unlock and the\nback to lengthen and widen, a student greatly reduces\nstrain. In Alexander lessons students learn to direct\nthemselves this way in activity and become skilled in\nfluid, coordinated movement.\n111\n\nAlexander technique\n\nKEY TERMS\n\n\fAlkaline phosphatase test\n\nPrecautions\n\nResources\n\nSide effects\n\nBOOKS\n\nThe focus of the Alexander technique is educational. Teachers use their hands simply to gently guide\nstudents in movement. Therefore, both contraindications and potential physiological side effects are kept\nto a minimum. No forceful treatment of soft tissue or\nbony structure is attempted, so damage to tissues, even\nin the case of errors in teaching, is unlikely.\nAs students\u2019 sensory awareness develops in the\ncourse of Alexander lessons, they become more\nacutely aware of chronic tension patterns. As students\nlearn to release excessive tension in their muscles and\nto sustain this release in daily activity, they may\nexperience tightness or soreness in the connective tissue. This is caused by the connective tissue adapting to\nthe lengthened and released muscles and the expanded\nrange of movement in the joints.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

In some cases, somatic memories surface, bringing to consciousness past injury or\ntrauma.

In a healthy liver, fluid containing alkaline phosphate and other substances is\ncontinually drained away through the bile duct. In a\ndiseased liver, this bile duct is often blocked, keeping\nfluid within the liver. Alkaline phosphatase accumulates and eventually escapes into the bloodstream.\nThe alkaline phosphatase of the liver is produced by\nthe cells lining the small bile ducts (ductoles) in the liver.\nIts origin differs from that of other enzymes called\naminotransferases. If the liver disease is primarily of\nan obstructive nature (cholestatic), i.e. involving the\nbiliary drainage system, the alkaline phosphatase will\nbe the first and foremost enzyme elevation. If, on the\nother hand, the disease is primarily of the liver cells\n(hepatocytes), the aminotransferases will rise prominently. Thus, these enzymes are very useful in\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\n\fAlkaline phosphatase\u2014An enzyme found throughout the body, primarily in liver, bone, placenta, and\nintestine.\nCholestatis\u2014Stoppage or suppression of the flow\nof bile.\nEnzyme\u2014A substance needed to trigger specific\nchemical reactions.\nHepatocellular\u2014Of or pertaining to liver cells.\nHepatocyte\u2014A liver cell.\nIsoenzyme\u2014A variation of an enzyme.\n\ndistinguishing the type of liver disease\u2013cholestatic or\nhepatocellular.\nGrowing bones need alkaline phosphatase.

Some tumors, however, start\nproduction of the same kind of alkaline phosphatase\nproduced by the placenta. These tumors are called\ngerm cell tumors and include testicular cancer and\ncertain brain tumors.\nAlkaline phosphatase from the intestine is\nincreased in a person with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis.\n\nDescription\nAlkaline phosphatase is measured by combining\nthe person\u2019s serum with specific substances with which\nalkaline phosphatase is known to react. The end\nproduct of this reaction is measured; and from that\nmeasurement, the amount of alkaline phosphatase in\nthe person\u2019s serum is determined.\nEach tissue\u2013liver, bone, placenta, and intestine\u2013\nproduces a slightly different alkaline phosphatase.\nThese variations are called isoenzymes. In the laboratory, alkaline phosphatase is measured as the total\namount or the amount of each of the the four isoenzymes. The isoenzymes react differently to heat, certain chemicals, and other processes in the laboratory.\nMethods to measure them separately are based on\nthese differences.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\nThe test is covered by insurance when medically\nnecessary.

ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in asthma patients who\nare allergic to this specific fungus.\n\nDescription\nABPA is an allergic reaction to a species of\nAspergillus called Aspergillus fumigatus. It is sometimes grouped together with other lung disorders\ncharacterized by eosinophilia\u2013an abnormal increase\nof a certain type of white blood cell in the blood\u2013\nunder the heading of eosinophilic pneumonia. These\ndisorders are also called hypersensitivity lung\ndiseases.\nABPA appears to be increasing in frequency in the\nUnited States, although the reasons for the increase\nare not clear. The disorder is most likely to occur in\nadult asthmatics aged 20-40. It affects males and\nfemales equally.\n\nCauses and symptoms\nABPA develops when the patient breathes air\ncontaining Aspergillus spores. These spores are\nfound worldwide, especially around riverbanks,\nmarshes, bogs, forests, and wherever there is wet or\ndecaying vegetation. They are also found on wet\npaint, construction materials, and in air conditioning systems.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

ABPA is a nosocomial infection,\nwhich means that a patient can get it in a hospital.\nWhen Aspergillus spores reach the bronchi, which\nare the branches of the windpipe that lead into the\nlungs, the bronchi react by contracting spasmodically. So the patient has difficulty breathing and\nusually wheezes or coughs. Many patients with\nABPA also run a low-grade fever and lose their\nappetites.\nComplications\nPatients with ABPA sometimes cough up large\namounts of blood, a condition that is called hemoptysis. They may also develop a serious long-term form of\nbronchiectasis, the formation of fibrous tissue in the\nlungs.

In the skin test, a\nsmall amount of antigen is injected into the upper\nlayer of skin on the patient\u2019s forearm about four\ninches below the elbow. If the patient has a high\nlevel of IgE antibodies in the tissue, he or she will\ndevelop what is called a \u2018\u2018wheal and flare\u2019\u2019 reaction\nin about 15-20 minutes. A \u2018\u2018wheal and flare\u2019\u2019 reaction\nis characterized by the eruption of a reddened, itching\nspot on the skin. Some patients with ABPA will\ndevelop the so-called late reaction to the skin test, in\nwhich a red, sore, swollen area develops about six to\neight hours after the initial reaction.\nDiagnostic imaging\nChest x rays and CT scans are used to check for\nthe presence of fluid accumulation in the lungs and\nsigns of bronchiectasis.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\nTreatment\nABPA is usually treated with prednisone\n(Meticorten) or other corticosteroids taken by mouth,\nand with bronchodilators.\nAntifungal drugs are not used to treat ABPA\nbecause it is caused by an allergic reaction to\nAspergillus rather than by direct infection of tissue.\nFollow-up care\nPatients with ABPA should be given periodic checkups with chest x rays and a spirometer test. A spirometer is\nan instrument that evaluates the patient\u2019s lung capacity.\n\nPrognosis\nMost patients with ABPA respond well to corticosteroid treatment. Others have a chronic course with\ngradual improvement over time. The best indicator of\na good prognosis is a long-term fall in the patient\u2019s IgE\nlevel.

Most cases are children\nbetween the ages of two and seven. Boys are affected\nmore often than girls, and most cases occur from late\nfall to winter.\n\nCauses and symptoms\nCauses\nAP is caused by a reaction involving antibodies,\nspecial proteins of the immune system. Antibodies are\ndesigned to bind with foreign proteins, called antigens.\nIn some situations, antigen-antibody complexes can\nbecome too large to remain suspended in the bloodstream. When this occurs, they precipitate out and\nbecome lodged in the capillaries. This can cause the\ncapillary to burst, allowing a local hemorrhage.\nThe source of the antigen causing AP is unknown.\nAntigens may be introduced by bacterial or viral\ninfection. More than 75% of patients report having had\nan infection of the throat, upper respiratory tract, or\ngastrointestinal system several weeks before the onset\nof AP. Other complex molecules can act as antigens\nas well, including drugs such as antibiotics or vaccines.\nOtherwise harmless substances that stimulate an immune\nreaction are known as allergens. Drug allergens that may\ncause AP include penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin,\nand quinine. Vaccines possibly linked to AP include\nthose for typhoid, measles, cholera, and yellow fever.\nSymptoms\nThe onset of AP may be preceded by a headache,\nfever, and loss of appetite. Most patients first develop\n116\n\nKEY TERMS\nGlomeruli\u2014Knots of capillaries in the kidneys\nresponsible for filtering the blood (singular,\nglomerulus).\nan itchy skin rash.

It affects between 10-20% of all people in the\nUnited States, and is responsible for 2.5% of all doctor\nvisits. Antihistamines and other drugs used to treat allergic rhinitis make up a significant fraction of both\nprescription and over-the-counter drug sales each year.\nThere are two types of allergic rhinitis: seasonal\nand perennial. Seasonal AR occurs in the spring, summer, and early fall, when airborne plant pollens are at\ntheir highest levels. In fact, the term hay fever is really\na misnomer, since allergy to grass pollen is only one\ncause of symptoms for most people. Perennial AR\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\noccurs all year and is usually caused by home or workplace airborne pollutants. A person can be affected\nby one or both types. Symptoms of seasonal AR are\nworst after being outdoors, while symptoms of perennial AR are worst after spending time indoors.\nBoth types of allergies can develop at any age,\nalthough onset in childhood through early adulthood\nis most common.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

When the antibodies encounter\nallergens, they trigger release of the granules, which\nspill out their chemicals onto neighboring cells, including blood vessels and nerve cells. One of these\nchemicals, histamine, binds to the surfaces of these\nother cells, through special proteins called histamine\nreceptors. Interaction of histamine with receptors on\nblood vessels causes neighboring cells to become\nleaky, leading to the fluid collection, swelling, and\n118\n\nincreased redness characteristic of a runny nose and\nred, irritated eyes. Histamine also stimulates pain\nreceptors, causing the itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and\nthroat common in allergic rhinitis.\nThe number of possible airborne allergens is\nenormous. Seasonal AR is most commonly caused\nby grass and tree pollens, since their pollen is produced\nin large amounts and is dispersed by the wind. Showy\nflowers, like roses or lilacs, that attract insects produce\na sticky pollen that is less likely to become airborne.\nDifferent plants release their pollen at different times\nof the year, so seasonal AR sufferers may be most\naffected in spring, summer, or fall, depending on\nwhich plants provoke a response. The amount of pollen\nin the air is reflected in the pollen count, often broadcast on the daily news during allergy season. Pollen\ncounts tend to be lower after a good rain that washes\nthe pollen out of the air and higher on warm, dry,\nwindy days.\nVirtually any type of tree or grass may cause AR.\nA few types of weeds that tend to cause the most\ntrouble for people include the following:\n\u0002\n\nragweed\n\n\u0002\n\nsagebrush\n\n\u0002\n\nlamb\u2019s-quarters\n\n\u0002\n\nplantain\n\n\u0002\n\npigweed\n\n\u0002\n\ndock/sorrel\n\n\u0002\n\ntumbleweed\n\nPerennial AR is often triggered by house dust, a\ncomplicated mixture of airborne particles, many of\nwhich are potent allergens.

They may be used after\nsymptoms appear, though they may be even more\neffective when used preventively, before symptoms\nappear. A wide variety of antihistamines are available.\n\nOlder antihistamines often produce drowsiness as\na major side effect. Such antihistamines include the\nfollowing:\n\u0002\n\ndiphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics)\n\n\u0002\n\nchlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics)\n\n\u0002\n\nbrompheniramine (Dimetane and generics)\n\n\u0002\n\nclemastine (Tavist and generics).\n\nNewer antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness are available by prescription and include the\nfollowing:\n\u0002\n\nastemizole (Hismanal)\n\n\u0002\n\nfexofenadine (Allegra)\n\n\u0002\n\ncetirizine (Zyrtec)\n\n\u0002\n\nazelastin HCl (Astelin).\n\nLoratidine (Claritin) was available only by prescription but was released to over-the-counter status\nby the FDA.\nHismanal has the potential to cause serious heart\narrhythmias when taken with the antibiotic erythromycin, the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itraconazole, or the antimalarial drug quinine. Taking more than\nthe recommended dose of Hismanal can also cause\narrhythimas.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Seldane (terfenadine), the original nondrowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn from\nthe market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because\nof this potential and because of the availability of an\nequally effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.\nLEUKOTRIENE RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (montelukast or Singulair\nand zafirlukast or Accolate) are a newer class of drugs\nused daily to help prevent asthma. They\u2019ve also become\napproved in the United States to treat allergic rhinitis.\nDECONGESTANTS. Decongestants constrict blood\nvessels to counteract the effects of histamine. This\ndecreases the amount of blood in the nasopahryngeal\n\n119\n\nAllergic rhinitis\n\nOther potential causes of perennial allergic rhinitis include the following:\n\n\fAllergic rhinitis\n\nand sinus mucosa and reduces swelling. Nasal sprays\nare available that can be applied directly to the nasal\nlining and oral systemic preparations are available.\nDecongestants are stimulants and may cause increased\nheart rate and blood pressure, headaches, isomnia,\nagitation and difficulty emptying the bladder. Use of\ntopical decongestants for longer than several days can\ncause loss of effectiveness and rebound congestion, in\nwhich nasal passages become more severely swollen\nthan before treatment.\n\nsymptom relief, western herbal remedies including eyebright (Euphrasia officinalis) and nettle (Urtica dioica) may\nbe helpful. Bee pollen may also be effective in alleviating\nor eliminating AR symptoms. A 2004 report said that\nphototherapy (treatment with a combination of ultraviolet and visible light) decreased the symptoms of allergic\nrhinitis in a majority of patients who did not respond well\nto traditional drug treatment.\n\nTOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. Topical corticosteroids reduce mucous membrane inflammation and are\navailable by prescription. Allergies tend to become\nworse as the season progresses because the immune\nsystem becomes sensitized to particular antigens and\ncan produce a faster, stronger response.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

As\na result, they are best started before allergy season\nbegins. Side effects are usually mild, but may include\nheadaches, nosebleeds, and unpleasant taste sensations.\n\nMost people with AR can achieve adequate relief\nwith a combination of preventive strategies and treatment. While allergies may improve over time, they\nmay also get worse or expand to include new allergens.\nEarly treatment can help prevent an increased sensitization to other allergens.\n\nPrognosis\n\nPrevention\nReducing exposure to pollen may improve symptoms of seasonal AR. Strategies include the following:\n\u0002\n\nstay indoors with windows closed during the morning hours, when pollen levels are highest\n\n\u0002\n\nkeep car windows up while driving\n\n\u0002\n\nuse a surgical face mask when outside\n\n\u0002\n\navoid uncut fields\n\n\u0002\n\nlearn which trees are producing pollen in which seasons, and avoid forests at the height of pollen season\n\n\u0002\n\nwash clothes and hair after being outside\n\n\u0002\n\nclean air conditioner filters in the home regularly\n\n\u0002\n\nuse electrostatic filters for central air conditioning\n\nMAST CELL STABILIZERS. Cromolyn sodium pre-\n\nvents the release of mast cell granules, thereby preventing release of histamine and the other chemicals\ncontained in them. It acts as a preventive treatment if it\nis begun several weeks before the onset of the allergy\nseason. It can be used for perennial AR as well.\nImmunotherapy\nImmunotherapy, also known as desensitization or\nallergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types in the\nbody, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to cause allergic\nreactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by allergy testing\nto determine the precise allergens responsible. Injections\ninvolve very small but gradually increasing amounts of\nallergen, over several weeks or months, with periodic\nboosters. Full benefits may take up to several years to\nachieve and are not seen at all in about one in five\npatients. Individuals receiving all shots will be monitored closely following each shot because of the small\nrisk of anaphylaxis, a condition that can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop in blood pressure.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Normally,\nthe immune system responds to foreign microorganisms or particles by producing specific proteins called\nantibodies. These antibodies are capable of binding\nto identifying molecules, or antigens, on the foreign\nparticle. This reaction between antibody and antigen\nsets off a series of chemical reactions designed to protect the body from infection. Sometimes, this same\nseries of reactions is triggered by harmless, everyday\nsubstances such as pollen, dust, and animal danders.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\nWhen this occurs, an allergy develops against the\noffending substance (an allergen.)\nMast cells, one of the major players in allergic\nreactions, capture and display a particular type of\nantibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE) that\nbinds to allergens. Inside mast cells are small chemical-filled packets called granules. Granules contain a\nvariety of potent chemicals, including histamine.\nImmunologists separate allergic reactions into\ntwo main types: immediate hypersensitivity reactions,\nwhich are predominantly mast cell-mediated and\noccur within minutes of contact with allergen; and\ndelayed hypersensitivity reactions, mediated by\nT cells (a type of white blood cells) and occurring\nhours to days after exposure.\nInhaled or ingested allergens usually cause\nimmediate hypersensitivity reactions. Allergens bind\nto IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells, which\nspill the contents of their granules out onto neighboring cells, including blood vessels and nerve cells.\nHistamine binds to the surfaces of these other cells\nthrough special proteins called histamine receptors.\nInteraction of histamine with receptors on blood vessels causes increased leakiness, leading to the fluid\ncollection, swelling and increased redness. Histamine\nalso stimulates pain receptors, making tissue more\nsensitive and irritable. Symptoms last from one to\nseveral hours following contact.\nIn the upper airways and eyes, immediate hypersensitivity reactions cause the runny nose and itchy,\nbloodshot eyes typical of allergic rhinitis. In the gastrointestinal tract, these reactions lead to swelling and\nirritation of the intestinal lining, which causes the\ncramping and diarrhea typical of food allergy.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Mast cells in the tissues and basophils in\nthe blood release mediators that give rise to the clinical\nsymptoms of this IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Commonly, this is associated with allergies to\nmedications, foods, and insect venoms.

Next, an labeled antibody against the\nIgE is added and will bind to any IgE on the solid\nphase. The excess is washed away and the levels of IgE\nare determined. The commonly used RAST test (radio\nallergo sorbent test) employed radio-labeled Anti-IgE\nantibodies. Updated methods now incorporate the use\nof enyzme-labeled antibodies in ELISA assays\n(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays).\nTotal Serum IgE\nThe total level of IgE in the serum is commonly\nmeasured with a two-site immunometric assay.

These medications reduce the recruitment of inflammatory cells as\nwell as the synthesis of cytokines. They are available by\nprescription. Allergies tend to become worse as the\nseason progresses because the immune system becomes\nsensitized to particular antigens and can produce a\nfaster, stronger response. Topical corticosteroids are\nespecially effective at reducing this seasonal sensitization because they work more slowly and last longer\nthan most other medication types. As a result, they\nare best started before allergy season begins. Side\neffects are usually mild, but may include headaches,\nnosebleeds, and unpleasant taste sensations.\nBronchodilators or metered-dose inhalers (MDI)\nBecause allergic reactions involving the lungs\ncause the airways or bronchial tubes to narrow, as in\nasthma, bronchodilators, which cause the smooth muscle lining the airways to open or dilate, can be very\neffective. When inhalers are used, it is important that\nthe patient be educated in the proper use of these\nmedications.

Immunotherapy is preceded by\nallergy testing to determine the precise allergens\nresponsible. Injections involve very small but gradually increasing amounts of allergen, over several weeks\nor months, with periodic boosters. Full benefits may\n128\n\ntake up to several years to achieve and are not seen at\nall in about one in five patients. Individuals receiving\nall shots will be monitored closely following each shot\nbecause of the small risk of anaphylaxis, a condition\nthat can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop\nin blood pressure.\nOther drugs, such as leukotriene modifiers, are\nused to prevent asthma attacks and in the long-term\nmanagement of allergies and asthma.\nResources\nBOOKS\n\nHans-Uwe, Simon, editor.

This reaction\nbetween antibody and antigen sets off a series of\nreactions designed to protect the body from infection. Sometimes, this same series of reactions is\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\n\fThis patient is being exposed to certain allergens as part of\nan allergy test. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by\npermission.)\n\ntriggered by harmless, everyday substances. This is\nthe condition known as allergy, and the offending\nsubstance is called an allergen. Common inhaled\nallergens include pollen, dust, and insect parts from\ntiny house mites. Common food allergens include\nnuts, fish, and milk.\nAllergic reactions involve a special set of cells\nin the immune system known as mast cells. Mast\ncells serve as guards in the tissues where the body\nmeets the outside world: the skin, the mucous\nmembranes of the eyes and other areas, and the linings of the respiratory and digestive systems. Mast\ncells display a special type of antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside,\nmast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets,\ncalled granules. When the antibodies encounter allergens, they trigger the release of granules, which spill\nout their chemicals onto neighboring cells, including\nblood vessels and nerve cells. One of these chemicals,\nhistamine, binds to the surfaces of these other cells,\nthrough special proteins called histamine receptors.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Also a factor is\nthe condition of the hair and the scalp beneath it.\nSometimes only the hair is affected; sometimes the\nskin is visibly diseased as well.\n\nCauses and symptoms\n\u0002\n\nMale pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) is considered normal in adult males.

The exact function of this protein is\nunknown. After birth, the infant\u2019s liver stops producing\nAFP, and an adult liver contains only trace amounts.\nDuring pregnancy, the fetus excretes AFP in urine and\nsome of the protein crosses the fetal membranes to\nenter the mother\u2019s blood. The level of AFP can then\nbe determined by analyzing a sample of the mother\u2019s\nblood. By analyzing the amount of AFP found in a\nblood or amniotic fluid sample, doctors can determine\nthe probability that the fetus is at risk for certain birth\ndefects. It is very important that the doctor know\nprecisely how old the fetus is when the test is performed\nsince the AFP level changes over the length of the\npregnancy. Alone, AFP screening cannot diagnose a\nbirth defect. The test is used as an indicator of risk and\nthen an appropriate line of testing (such as amniocentesis or ultrasound) follows, based on the results.\nAbnormally high AFP may indicate that the\nfetus has an increased risk of a neural tube defect,\nthe most common and severe type of disorder\nassociated with increased AFP. These types of defects\ninclude spinal column defects (spina bifida) and\nanencephaly (a severe and usually fatal brain\nabnormality).

There are several varieties of the syndrome, some occurring in childhood and others not\ncausing symptoms until men reach their 20s or 30s. All\nvarieties of the syndrome are characterized by kidney\ndisease that usually progresses to chronic kidney failure and by uremia (the presence of excessive amounts\nof urea and other waste products in the blood).\n\nCauses and symptoms\nAlport syndrome in most cases is caused by a\ndefect in one or more genes located on the X chromosome.

AMS\nis the mildest, and the other two represent severe, lifethreatening forms of altitude sickness.\nAltitude sickness occurs because the partial pressure of oxygen decreases with altitude. (Partial pressure is a term applied to gases that is similar to the way\nthe term concentration is applied to liquid solutions.)\nFor instance, at 18,000 feet (5,486 m) the partial pressure of oxygen drops to one-half its value at sea level\nand, therefore, there is a substantially lower amount of\noxygen available for the individual to inhale. This is\nknown as hypoxia. Furthermore, since there is less\noxygen to inhale, less oxygen reaches the blood. This\nis known as hypoxemia. These two conditions are the\nmajor factors that form the basis for all the medical\nproblems associated with altitude sickness.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\nHypoxia\u2014A deficiency in the amount of oxygen\nrequired for effective ventilation.\nPulmonary\u2014Pertaining to the lungs.\n\nAs a person becomes hypoxemic, his natural\nresponse is to breathe more rapidly (hyperventilate).\nThis is the body\u2019s attempt to bring in more oxygen at\na rapid rate. This attempt at alleviating the effects of the\nhypoxia at higher altitudes is known as acclimatization,\nand it occurs during the first few days. Acclimatization\nis a response that occurs in individuals who travel from\nlower to higher altitudes. There are groups of people\nwho have lived at high altitudes (for example, in the\nHimalayan and Andes mountains) for generations, and\nthey are simply accustomed to living at such altitudes,\nperhaps through a genetic ability.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Although\nhypoxia is associated with the development of AMS,\nthe exact mechanism by which this condition develops\nhas yet to be confirmed. It is important to realize that\nsome individuals acclimatize to higher altitudes more\nefficiently than others. As a result, under similar conditions some will suffer from AMS while others will not.\nAt present, the susceptibility of otherwise healthy individuals to contracting AMS cannot be accurately predicted. Of those who do suffer from AMS, the condition\ntends to be most severe on the second or third day after\nreaching the high altitude, and it usually abates after\nthree to five days if they remain at the same\naltitude. However, it can recur if the individuals travel\nto an even higher altitude. Symptoms usually appear a\nfew hours to a few days following ascent, and they\ninclude dizziness, headache, shortness of breath, nausea,\nvomiting, loss of appetite, and insomnia.\nHigh-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a lifethreatening condition that afflicts a small percentage\nof those who suffer from AMS. In this condition, fluid\nleaks from within the pulmonary blood vessels into the\nlung tissue. As this fluid begins to accumulate within\n139\n\nAltitude sickness\n\nAlprazolam see Benzodiazepines\n\n\fAlzheimer\u2019s disease\n\nthe lung tissue (pulmonary edema), the individual\nbegins to become more and more short of breath.\nHAPE is known to afflict all types of individuals,\nregardless of their level of physical fitness.\nTypically, the individual who suffers from HAPE\nascends quickly to a high altitude and almost immediately develops shortness of breath, a rapid heart\nrate, a cough productive of a large amount of sometimes bloody sputum, and a rapid rate of breathing.\nIf no medical assistance is provided by this point,\nthe patient goes into a coma and dies within a few\nhours.\nHigh-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), the rarest\nand most severe form of altitude sickness, involves\ncerebral edema, and its mechanism of development is\nalso poorly understood.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

If no intervention is\nimplemented, death is the result.\n\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis for altitude sickness may be made\nfrom the observation of the individual\u2019s symptoms\nduring travel to higher altitudes.\n\nPrevention\nWhen individuals ascend from sea level, it is recommended that they spend at least one night at\nan intermediate altitude prior to ascending to higher\nelevations. In general, climbers should take at least two\ndays to go from sea level to 8,000 feet (2,438m). After\nreaching that point, healthy climbers should generally\nallow one day for each additional 2,000 feet (610m), and\none day of rest should be taken every two or three days.\nShould mild symptoms begin to surface, further ascent\nshould be avoided. If the symptoms are severe, the individual should return to a lower altitude. Some reports\nindicate that acetazolamide (a diuretic) may be taken\nbefore ascent as a preventative measure for AMS.\nPaying attention to diet can also help prevent altitude sickness. Water loss is a problem at higher altitudes, so climbers should drink ample water (enough to\nproduce copious amounts of relatively light-colored or\nclear urine). Alcohol and large amounts of salt should\nbe avoided. Eating frequent small, high-carbohydrate\nsnacks (for example, fruits, jams and starchy foods)\ncan help, especially in the first few days of climbing.\nResources\nBOOKS\n\nCrystal, R.

Narcotics should be avoided because\nthey may blunt the respiratory response, making\nit even more difficult for the person to breathe deeply\nand rapidly enough to compensate for the lower levels\nof oxygen in the environment.

Two types of AD exist: familial AD (FAD),\nwhich is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disease,\nand sporadic AD, with no obvious inheritance pattern. AD also is described in terms of age at onset, with\nearly onset AD occurring in people younger than 65,\nand late-onset occurring in those 65 and older. Early\nonset AD comprises about 5-10 % of AD cases and\naffects people aged 30 to 60. Some cases of early onset\nAD are inherited and are common in some families.\nEarly-onset AD often progresses faster than the more\ncommon late-onset type.\nAll cases of FAD, which is relatively uncommon,\nthat have been identified to date are the early onset\ntype. As many as 50% of FAD cases are known to\nbe caused by three genes located on three different\nchromosomes. Some families have mutations in the\nAPP gene located on chromosome 21, which causes\nthe production of abnormal APP protein. Others\nhave mutations in a gene called presenilin 1 located\non chromosome 14, which causes the production of\nabnormal presenilin 1 protein, and others have mutations in a similar gene called presenilin 2 located\non chromosome 1, which causes production of abnormal presenilin 2. Presenilin 1 may be one of the\nenzymes that clips APP into beta-amyloid; it also\nmay be important in the synaptic connections between\nbrain cells.\nThere is no evidence that the mutated genes that\ncause early onset FAD also cause late onset AD, but\ngenetics appears to play a role in this more common\nform of AD. Discovered by researchers at Duke\nUniversity in the early 1990s, potentially the most\nimportant genetic link to AD was on chromosome 19.\nA gene on this chromosome, called APOE (apolipoprotein E), codes for a protein involved in transporting\nlipids into neurons.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

The relatively rare APOE\ne2 appears to protect some people from AD, as it seems\nto be associated with a lower risk of AD and a later age\nof onset if AD develops. APOE e3 is the most common\nversion found in the general population, and only\nappears to have a neutral role in AD. However, APOE\ne4 appears to increase the risk of developing late onset\nAD with the inheritance of one or two copies of APOE\ne4. Compared to those without APOE e4, people with\none copy are about three times as likely to develop lateGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\n\fOther non-genetic factors have been studied in\nrelation to the causes of AD. Inflammation of the\nbrain may play a role in development of AD, and use\nof nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nwere once thought to reduce the risk of developing\nAD. Other agents once thought to reduce chances of\ndementia are now thought to increase its risk. In 2002,\nhormone replacement therapy (HRT), which combines\nestrogen and progestogen, was found to double the\nrisk of developing dementia in postmenopausal\nwomen. Highly reactive molecular fragments called\nfree radicals damage cells of all kinds, especially\nbrain cells, which have smaller supplies of protective\nantioxidants thought to protect against free radical\ndamage. Vitamin E is one such antioxidant, and its\nuse in AD may be of possible theoretical benefit.\nWhile the ultimate cause or causes of Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease still are unknown, there are several risk factors\nthat increase a person\u2019s likelihood of developing the\ndisease. The most significant one is, of course, age;\nolder people develop AD at much higher rates than\nyounger ones.

Blood cholesterol levels also may be\nimportant. Scientists have shown that high blood\ncholesterol levels in special breeds of genetically\nengineered (transgenic) mice may increase the rate of\nplaque deposition. There are also parallels between\nAD and other progressive neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia, including prion diseases,\nParkinson\u2019s disease, and Huntington\u2019s disease.\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\nNumerous epidemiological studies of populations\nalso are being conducted to learn more about whether\nand to what extent early life events, socioeconomic\nfactors, and ethnicity have an impact on the development of AD. For example, a 2003 report showed that\nthe more formal education a person has, the better his\nor her memory is, despite presence of AD. Other studies have related education level or participation in\nleisure activities such as playing cards or doing crossword puzzles to delayed onset of AD.\nMany environmental factors have been suspected\nof contributing to AD, but epidemiological population studies have not borne out these links. Among\nthese have been pollutants in drinking water, aluminum from commercial products, and metal dental fillings. To date, none of these factors has been shown to\ncause AD or increase its likelihood. Further research\nmay yet turn up links to other environmental factors.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease begin gradually, usually with memory lapses. Occasional memory lapses are of course common to everyone, and do\nnot by themselves signify any change in cognitive\nfunction. The person with AD may begin with only\nthe routine sort of memory lapse \u2014 forgetting where\nthe car keys are \u2014 but progress to more profound or\ndisturbing losses, such as forgetting that he or she can\neven drive a car. Becoming lost or disoriented on a walk\naround the neighborhood becomes more likely as the\ndisease progresses. A person with AD may forget the\nnames of family members, or forget what was said at\nthe beginning of a sentence by the time he hears the end.\nAs AD progresses, other symptoms appear,\nincluding inability to perform routine tasks, loss of\njudgment, and personality or behavior changes.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Except\nin the disease\u2019s earliest stages, accurate history from\nfamily members or caregivers is essential. Since there\nare both prescription and over-the-counter drugs\nthat can cause the same mental changes as AD, a\ncareful review of the patient\u2019s drug, medicine, and\nalcohol use is important. AD-like symptoms also\ncan be provoked by other medical conditions, including tumors, infection, and dementia caused by mild\nstrokes (multi-infarct dementia).

Recent\nreports show that prompt intervention can slow decline\nfrom AD. The use of medications mentioned below as\nearly as possible in the course of AD can help people\nwith the disease maintain independent function as long\nas possible. The remaining treatment for a person with\nAD is good nursing care, providing both physical and\nemotional support for a person who is gradually able to\ndo less and less for himself, and whose behavior is\nbecoming more and more erratic. Modifications of the\nhome to increase safety and security often are necessary. The caregiver also needs support to prevent anger,\ndespair, and burnout from becoming overwhelming.\nBecoming familiar with the issues likely to lie ahead,\nand considering the appropriate financial and legal\nissues early on, can help both the patient and family\ncope with the difficult process of the disease. Regular\nmedical care by a practitioner with a non-defeatist\nattitude toward AD is important so that illnesses such\nas urinary or respiratory infections can be diagnosed\nand treated properly, rather than being incorrectly\nattributed to the inevitable decline seen in AD.\nPeople with AD often are depressed or anxious,\nand may suffer from sleeplessness, poor nutrition, and\ngeneral poor health. Each of these conditions is treatable to some degree. It is important for the person\nwith AD to eat well and continue to exercise.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Tacrine has been shown to be effective for\nimproving memory skills, but only in patients with\nmild-to-moderate AD, and even then in less than half\nof those who take it. Its beneficial effects are usually\nmild and temporary, but it may delay the need for\nnursing home admission. The most significant side\neffect is an increase in a liver enzyme known as alanine\naminotransferase, or ALT. Patients taking tacrine\nmust have a weekly blood test to monitor their ALT\nlevels. Other frequent side effects include nausea,\nvomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, indigestion, and\nskin rash. The cost of tacrine was about $125 per\nmonth in early 1998, with additional costs for the\nweekly blood monitoring. Despite its high cost, tacrine\nappears to be cost-effective for those who respond to\nit, since it may decrease the number of months a\npatient needs nursing care. Donepezil is the drug\nmost commonly used to treat mild to moderate symptoms of AD, although it only helps some patients for\nperiods of time ranging from months to about two\nyears. Donepezil has two advantages over tacrine: it\nhas fewer side effects, and it can be given once daily\nrather than three times daily. Donepezil does not\nappear to affect liver enzymes, and therefore does\nnot require weekly blood tests. The frequency of\nabdominal side effects is also lower. The monthly\ncost is approximately the same. Rivastigmine,\napproved for use in April of 2000, has been shown to\nimprove the ability of patients to carry out daily activities, such as eating and dressing, decrease behavioral\nsymptoms such as delusions and agitation, and improve\ncognitive functions such as thinking, memory, and\nspeaking.

Vision is a combination of the\nclarity of the images of the eyes (visual acuity) and the\nprocessing of those images by the brain. If the images\nproduced by the two eyes are substantially different,\nthe brain may not be able to fuse the images. Instead of\nseeing two different images or double vision (diplopia), the brain suppresses the blurrier image. This\nsuppression can lead to amblyopia. During the first\nfew years of life, preferring one eye over the other may\nlead to poor visual development in the blurrier eye.\n\nCauses and symptoms\nSome of the major causes of amblyopia are as\nfollows:\n\u0002\n\nStrabismus. A misalignment of the eyes (strabismus)\nis the most common cause of functional amblyopia.\nThe two eyes are looking in two different directions at\nthe same time. The brain is sent two different images\nand this causes confusion. Images from the misaligned\nor \u2018\u2018crossed\u2019\u2019 eye are turned off to avoid double vision.\n\n\u0002\n\nAnisometropia. This is another type of functional\namblyopia. In this case, there is a difference of refractive states between the two eyes (in other words, a\ndifference of prescriptions between the two eyes).\nFor example, one eye may be more nearsighted than\nthe other eye, or one eye may be farsighted and the\nother eye nearsighted. Because the brain cannot fuse\nthe two dissimilar images, the brain will suppress the\nblurrier image, causing the eye to become amblyopic.\n\n\u0002\n\nCataract. Clouding of the lens of the eye will cause\nthe image to be blurrier than the other eye. The brain\n\u2018\u2018prefers\u2019\u2019 the clearer image. The eye with the cataract\nmay become amblyopic.\n\n\u0002\n\nPtosis. This is the drooping of the upper eyelid.

While there is\nsome controversy regarding the age children should\nhave their first vision examination, their eyes can, in\nactuality, be examined at any age, even at one day of life.\nSome recommend that children have their vision\nchecked by their pediatrician, family physician,\nophthalmologist, or optometrist at or before six\nmonths of age. Others recommend testing by at least\nthe child\u2019s fourth birthday. There may be a \u2018\u2018critical\nperiod\u2019\u2019 in the development of vision, and amblyopia\nmay not be treatable after age eight or nine. The earlier\namblyopia is found, the better the possible outcome.\nMost physicians test vision as part of a child\u2019s medical\nexamination. If there is any sign of an eye problem,\nthey may refer a child to an eye specialist.\nThere are objective methods, such as retinoscopy,\nto measure the refractive status of the eyes. This can\nhelp determine anisometropia. In retinoscopy, a handheld instrument is used to shine a light in the child\u2019s (or\ninfant\u2019s) eyes. Using hand-held lenses, a rough prescription can be obtained. Visual acuity can be determined using a variety of methods. Many different eye\ncharts are available (e.g., tumbling E, pictures, or\nletters). In amblyopia, single letters are easier to\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE\n\nStrabismus\u2014A condition in which the eyes are\nmisaligned and point in different directions. One\neye may look straight ahead, while the other turns\ninward, outward, upward, or downward. This is\nalso called crossed-eyes.\nVisual acuity\u2014Acuity is the acuteness or sharpness\nof vision.\n\nrecognize than when a whole line is shown. This is\ncalled the \u2018\u2018crowding effect\u2019\u2019 and helps in diagnosing\namblyopia. Neutral density filters may also be held\nover the eye to aid in the diagnosis. Sometimes visual\nfields to determine defects in the area of vision will be\nperformed. Color vision testing may also be performed.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}

Your task is to act as a precision knowledge extraction engine from a given medical text document. Identify all relevant medical entities and their relationships according to the provided schema.\n\n-SCHEMA DEFINITION-\nNode Types: Disease, Pathological_Finding, Symptom, Clinical_Finding, Side_Effect, Medication, Treatment, Diagnostic_Procedure, Medical_Device, Anatomy, Pathogen, Gene, Protein, Genetic_Disorder, Biological_Process, Clinical_Study, Age_Group, Lifestyle_Factor, Environmental_Factor\nRelationship Types: IS_A_TYPE_OF, PRESENTS_AS, HAS_SYMPTOM, HAS_FINDING, TREATED_BY, PREVENTS, DIAGNOSED_BY, HAS_INDICATION, HAS_CONTRAINDICATION, HAS_COMPLICATION, HAS_SIDE_EFFECT, USES_MEDICATION, USES_DEVICE, AFFECTS, CAUSED_BY, INCREASES_RISK_FOR, METABOLIZED_BY, ASSOCIATED_WITH, CODES_FOR, STUDIED_IN, OCCURS_IN_AGE_GROUP\n\n-EXTRACTION STEPS-\n1.  **Identify Entities:** Carefully read the text and identify all terms that match one of the node types in the schema. For each entity, you must extract:\n    - `entity_name`: The exact name of the entity as it appears in the text.\n    - `entity_type`: The corresponding type from the schema's Node Types list.\n    - `entity_description`: A concise, one-sentence description of the entity based on its context in the text.\n\n2.  **Identify Relationships:** Identify all relationships between the entities you found. The relationship must match one of the types in the schema. For each relationship, you must extract:\n    - `source_entity_name`: The name of the source entity.\n    - `source_entity_type`: The type of the source entity.\n    - `target_entity_name`: The name of the target entity.\n    - `target_entity_type`: The type of the target entity.\n    - `relation_type`: The corresponding type from the schema's Relationship Types list.\n    - `relationship_description`: A concise, one-sentence explanation of the relationship based on the text.\n\n-OUTPUT FORMATTING-\n1.  **CRITICAL:** Your entire response must be ONLY a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any introductory text, greetings, or markdown formatting like ```json.\n2.  The JSON object must have two primary keys: \"entities\" and \"relationships\".\n3.  The value for each key must be a list of JSON objects, where each object follows the structure defined in the EXTRACTION STEPS.\n4.

Again, it must be emphasized that amblyopia\nis a diagnosis of exclusion. Visual or life-threatening\nproblems can also cause a decrease in vision. An examination of the eyes and visual system is very important\nwhen there is an unexplained decrease in vision.\n\n-FINAL JSON OUTPUT-\n", "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.1}}
