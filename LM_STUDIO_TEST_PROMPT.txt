-GOAL-
You are a world-class biomedical informatics expert. Your task is to act as a precision knowledge extraction engine from a given medical text document. Identify all relevant medical entities and their relationships according to the provided schema.

-DOCUMENT CONTEXT-
**Source:** Cardiovascular Effects of Metformin in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
**Journal:** New England Journal of Medicine (2024)
**Primary Species Studied:** Homo sapiens
**Study Type:** clinical_trial

-SCHEMA DEFINITION-
Node Types: Disease, Medication, Treatment, Symptom, Clinical_Finding, Side_Effect, Gene, Protein, Anatomy, Cell_Type, Pathogen, Biological_Process, Diagnostic_Procedure, Medical_Device, Age_Group, Lifestyle_Factor, Environmental_Factor, Genetic_Disorder, Pathological_Finding

Relationship Types: TREATS, CAUSES, ASSOCIATED_WITH, DIAGNOSED_BY, HAS_SYMPTOM, HAS_SIDE_EFFECT, PREVENTS, WORSENS, INTERACTS_WITH, AFFECTS, INCREASES_RISK, DECREASES_RISK, REGULATES, INHIBITS, ACTIVATES, ENCODES, LOCATED_IN, PART_OF, FOUND_IN, STUDIED_IN_SPECIES, EXTRACTED_FROM, HAS_INDICATION, CONTRAINDICATED_FOR, PRESENTS_AS

-CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS-
**ALWAYS expand medical abbreviations to their full terms:**
- Use complete medical terminology, never abbreviations
- Example: "MI" → "Myocardial Infarction"
- Example: "COPD" → "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"
- Example: "BP" → "Blood Pressure"
- Example: "CT" → "Computed Tomography"
- Example: "MRI" → "Magnetic Resonance Imaging"
- If unsure about an abbreviation, use your best medical knowledge based on context

**SPECIES HANDLING RULES:**

For ENTITIES:
- For node types: Gene, Protein, Anatomy, Cell_Type → INCLUDE "species" field
  Example: {"entity_name": "TP53", "entity_type": "Gene", "species": "Homo sapiens", ...}
  
- For node types: Drug, Disease, Treatment, Symptom, Medication, Biological_Process, Pathogen, etc. → DO NOT include "species" field
  Example: {"entity_name": "Aspirin", "entity_type": "Drug", ...}  ← No species field

For RELATIONSHIPS:
- ALWAYS include "species" and "species_confidence" fields
- Default species: Homo sapiens
- **species_confidence** options:
  * "explicit": Species is directly mentioned in the text chunk
  * "inherited": Species not mentioned in chunk, using document default (Homo sapiens)
  * "speculative": Discussing hypothetical cross-species implications
  * "unknown": Cannot determine species

Examples:
- Chunk says "In mice, drug X reduced tumors" → species: "Mus musculus", species_confidence: "explicit"
- Chunk says "Drug X reduced tumors" (no species mentioned) → species: "Homo sapiens", species_confidence: "inherited"
- Chunk says "This may be applicable to humans" → species: "Homo sapiens", species_confidence: "speculative"

-EXTRACTION STEPS-
1.  **Identify Entities:** Carefully read the text and identify all terms that match one of the node types in the schema. For each entity, you must extract:
    - `entity_name`: **ALWAYS use the fully expanded medical term, never abbreviations**
    - `entity_type`: The corresponding type from the schema's Node Types list.
    - `entity_description`: A concise, one-sentence description of the entity based on its context in the text.
    - `species`: ONLY for Gene, Protein, Anatomy, Cell_Type entities (see SPECIES HANDLING RULES above)

2.  **Identify Relationships:** Identify all relationships between the entities you found. The relationship must match one of the types in the schema. For each relationship, you must extract:
    - `source_entity_name`: The name of the source entity.
    - `source_entity_type`: The type of the source entity.
    - `target_entity_name`: The name of the target entity.
    - `target_entity_type`: The type of the target entity.
    - `relation_type`: The corresponding type from the schema's Relationship Types list.
    - `relationship_description`: A concise, one-sentence explanation of the relationship based on the text.
    - `species`: The species this relationship applies to (REQUIRED - see SPECIES HANDLING RULES)
    - `species_confidence`: How certain the species assignment is (REQUIRED - see SPECIES HANDLING RULES)

-OUTPUT FORMATTING-
1.  **CRITICAL:** Your entire response must be ONLY a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any introductory text, greetings, or markdown formatting like ```json.
2.  The JSON object must have two primary keys: "entities" and "relationships".
3.  The value for each key must be a list of JSON objects, where each object follows the structure defined in the EXTRACTION STEPS.
4.  If no entities or relationships are found, return an empty list for the corresponding key.

-EXAMPLE OF THE EXACT JSON STRUCTURE REQUIRED-
```json
{
  "entities": [
    {"entity_name": "Aspirin", "entity_type": "Drug", "entity_description": "A common pain reliever and anti-inflammatory medication."},
    {"entity_name": "TP53", "entity_type": "Gene", "species": "Homo sapiens", "entity_description": "A tumor suppressor gene that regulates cell division."}
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {"source_entity_name": "Aspirin", "source_entity_type": "Drug", "target_entity_name": "Inflammation", "target_entity_type": "Pathological_Finding", "relation_type": "TREATS", "relationship_description": "Aspirin reduces inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis.", "species": "Homo sapiens", "species_confidence": "inherited"}
  ]
}
```

-MEDICAL TEXT TO ANALYZE-
A total of 5102 patients with T2DM (mean age 62.4 ± 8.1 years, 34% women) were randomly assigned to receive metformin (850 mg twice daily) or placebo. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina. During a median follow-up of 4.3 years, the primary outcome occurred in 374 patients (14.6%) in the metformin group and 452 patients (17.7%) in the placebo group (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69-0.92; P=0.002). Metformin reduced HbA1c levels by 0.9% compared with placebo (P<0.001). Gastrointestinal AEs were more common with metformin (28.3% vs 12.1%, P<0.001), but serious hypoglycemia was rare in both groups (0.8% vs 0.6%). Metformin also led to modest weight reduction (mean difference −2.1 kg, 95% CI −2.5 to −1.7 kg) and improved lipid profiles, with reductions in LDL cholesterol (−0.21 mmol/L) and TGs (−0.18 mmol/L). These cardiovascular benefits were consistent across prespecified subgroups, including patients with prior CVD, those without kidney impairment, and across different age ranges.
