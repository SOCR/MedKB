I Abdominal ultrasound
Definition
Ultrasound technology allows doctors to ‘‘see’’
inside a patient without resorting to surgery. A transmitter sends high frequency sound waves into the body,
where they bounce off the different tissues and organs
to produce a distinctive pattern of echoes. A receiver
‘‘hears’’ the returning echo pattern and forwards it to a
computer, which translates the data into an image on a
television screen. Because ultrasound can distinguish
subtle variations between soft, fluid-filled tissues, it is
particularly useful in providing diagnostic images of the
abdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment.

Purpose
The potential medical applications of ultrasound
were first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of
the sonar technology developed to detect submarines
during World War II. The first useful medical images
were produced in the early 1950s, and, by 1965, ultrasound quality had improved to the point that it came
into general medical use. Improvements in the technology, application, and interpretation of ultrasound
continue. Its low cost, versatility, safety and speed
have brought it into the top drawer of medical imaging
techniques.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

While pelvic ultrasound is widely known and commonly used for fetal monitoring during pregnancy,
ultrasound is also routinely used for general abdominal imaging. It has great advantage over x-ray imaging technologies in that it does not damage tissues
with ionizing radiation. Ultrasound is also generally
far better than plain x rays at distinguishing the subtle
variations of soft tissue structures, and can be used in
any of several modes, depending on the need at hand.
As an imaging tool, abdominal ultrasound generally is warranted for patients afflicted with: chronic or
acute abdominal pain; abdominal trauma; an obvious
or suspected abdominal mass; symptoms of liver disease, pancreatic disease, gallstones, spleen disease, kidney disease and urinary blockage; or symptoms of an
abdominal aortic aneurysm. Specifically:


Abdominal pain. Whether acute or chronic, pain can
signal a serious problem–from organ malfunction or
injury to the presence of malignant growths.
Ultrasound scanning can help doctors quickly sort
through potential causes when presented with general or ambiguous symptoms. All of the major
abdominal organs can be studied for signs of disease
that appear as changes in size, shape and internal
structure.



Abdominal trauma. After a serious accident, such as
a car crash or a fall, internal bleeding from injured
abdominal organs is often the most serious threat to
survival. Neither the injuries nor the bleeding are
immediately apparent. Ultrasound is very useful as
an initial scan when abdominal trauma is suspected,
and it can be used to pinpoint the location, cause,
and severity of hemorrhaging. In the case of puncture wounds, from a bullet for example, ultrasound
can locate the foreign object and provide a preliminary survey of the damage. The easy portability and
versatility of ultrasound technology has brought it
into common emergency room use, and even into
limited ambulance service.



Abdominal mass. Abnormal growths–tumors, cysts,
abscesses, scar tissue and accessory organs–can be
located and tentatively identified with ultrasound. In
particular, potentially malignant solid tumors can be
distinguished from benign fluid-filled cysts and
abscesses. Masses and malformations in any organ
or part of the abdomen can be found.



Liver disease. The types and underlying causes of
liver disease are numerous, though jaundice tends
to be a general symptom. Ultrasound can differentiate between many of the types and causes of liver
malfunction, and is particularly good at identifying
obstruction of the bile ducts and cirrhosis, which is
characterized by abnormal fibrous growths and
reduced blood flow.



Pancreatic disease. Inflammation and malformation
of the pancreas are readily identified by ultrasound,
as are pancreatic stones (calculi), which can disrupt
proper functioning.



Gallstones. Gallstones cause more hospital admissions
than any other digestive malady. These calculi can
cause painful inflammation of the gallbladder and
also obstruct the bile ducts that carry digestive enzymes
from the gallbladder and liver to the intestines.
Gallstones are readily identifiable with ultrasound.



Spleen disease. The spleen is particularly prone to
injury during abdominal trauma. It may also become
painfully inflamed when beset with infection or
cancer. These conditions also lend themselves well
to ultrasonic inspection and diagnosis.



Kidney disease. The kidneys are also prone to traumatic injury and are the organs most likely to form
calculi, which can block the flow of urine and cause
blood poisoning (uremia). A variety of diseases causing
distinct changes in kidney morphology can also lead to
complete kidney failure. Ultrasound imaging has proven extremely useful in diagnosing kidney disorders.



Abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a bulging weak
spot in the abdominal aorta, which supplies blood
directly from the heart to the entire lower body.
These aneurysms are relatively common and increase
in prevalence with age. A burst aortic aneurysm is
imminently life-threatening. However, they can be
readily identified and monitored with ultrasound
before acute complications result.

Ultrasound technology can also be used for treatment purposes, most frequently as a visual aid during
surgical procedures–such as guiding needle placement
to drain fluid from a cyst, or to extract tumor cells for
biopsy. Increasingly, direct therapeutic applications
for ultrasound are being developed.
2

The direct therapeutic value of ultrasonic waves
lies in their mechanical nature. They are shock waves,
just like audible sound, and vibrate the materials
through which they pass. These vibrations are mild,
virtually unnoticeable at the frequencies and intensities used for imaging. Properly focused however, highintensity ultrasound can be used to heat and physically
agitate targeted tissues.
High-intensity ultrasound is used routinely to treat
soft tissue injuries, such as strains, tears and associated
scarring. The heating and agitation are believed to
promote rapid healing through increased circulation.
Strongly focused, high-intensity, high-frequency ultrasound can also be used to physically destroy certain
types of tumors, as well as gallstones and other types
of calculi. Developing new treatment applications
for ultrasound is an active area of medical research.

Precautions
Properly performed, ultrasound imaging is virtually without risk or side effects. Some patients report
feeling a slight tingling and/or warmth while being
scanned, but most feel nothing at all. Ultrasound
waves of appropriate frequency and intensity are not
known to cause or aggravate any medical condition,
though any woman who thinks she might be pregnant
should raise the issue with her doctor before undergoing an abdominal ultrasound.
The value of ultrasound imaging as a medical tool,
however, depends greatly on the quality of the equipment used and the skill of the medical personnel operating it. Improperly performed and/or interpreted,
ultrasound can be worse than useless if it indicates
that a problem exists where there is none, or fails to
detect a significant condition. Basic ultrasound equipment is relatively inexpensive to obtain, and any doctor with the equipment can perform the procedure
whether qualified or not. Patients should not hesitate
to verify the credentials of technicians and doctors
performing ultrasounds, as well as the quality of the
equipment used and the benefits of the proposed
procedure.
In cases where ultrasound is used as a treatment
tool, patients should educate themselves about the
proposed procedure with the help of their doctors–as
is appropriate before any surgical procedure. Also,
any abdominal ultrasound procedure, diagnostic or
therapeutic, may be hampered by a patient’s body
type or other factors, such as the presence of excessive
bowel gas (which is opaque to ultrasound). In particular, very obese people are often not good candidates
for abdominal ultrasound.

Abdominal ultrasound

KEY TERMS
Accessory organ—A lump of tissue adjacent to an
organ that is similar to it, but which serves no important purpose, if functional at all. While not necessarily harmful, such organs can cause problems if they
grow too large or become cancerous. In any case,
their presence points to an underlying abnormality in
the parent organ.
Benign—In medical usage, benign is the opposite of
malignant. It describes an abnormal growth that is
stable, treatable and generally not life-threatening.
Biopsy— The surgical removal and analysis of a
tissue sample for diagnostic purposes. Usually, the
term refers to the collection and analysis of tissue
from a suspected tumor to establish malignancy.
Calculus—Any type of hard concretion (stone) in the
body, but usually found in the gallbladder, pancreas
and kidneys. They are formed by the accumulation of
excess mineral salts and other organic material such
as blood or mucous. Calculi (pl.) can cause problems
by lodging in and obstructing the proper flow of fluids,
such as bile to the intestines or urine to the bladder.
Cirrhosis—A chronic liver disease characterized by
the invasion of connective tissue and the degeneration of proper functioning–jaundice is often an
accompanying symptom. Causes of cirrhosis include
alcoholism, metabolic diseases, syphilis and congestive heart disease.
Common bile duct—The branching passage through
which bile–a necessary digestive enzyme–travels
from the liver and gallbladder into the small intestine. Digestive enzymes from the pancreas also enter
the intestines through the common bile duct.
Computed tomography scan (CT scan)—A specialized type of x-ray imaging that uses highly focused
and relatively low energy radiation to produce detailed
two-dimensional images of soft tissue structures, particularly the brain. CT scans are the chief competitor to
ultrasound and can yield higher quality images not
disrupted by bone or gas. They are, however, more
cumbersome, time consuming and expensive to perform, and they use ionizing electromagnetic radiation.

Description
Ultrasound includes all sound waves above the
frequency of human hearing–about 20 thousand
hertz, or cycles per second. Medical ultrasound generally uses frequencies between one and 10 million hertz
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Doppler—The Doppler effect refers to the apparent
change in frequency of sound wave echoes returning
to a stationary source from a moving target. If the
object is moving toward the source, the frequency
increases; if the object is moving away, the frequency decreases. The size of this frequency shift
can be used to compute the object’s speed–be it a
car on the road or blood in an artery. The Doppler
effect holds true for all types of radiation, not just
sound.
Frequency—Sound, whether traveling through air or
the human body, produces vibrations–molecules
bouncing into each other–as the shock wave travels
along. The frequency of a sound is the number of
vibrations per second. Within the audible range,
frequency means pitch–the higher the frequency,
the higher a sound’s pitch.
Ionizing radiation—Radiation that can damage living tissue by disrupting and destroying individual
cells at the molecular level. All types of nuclear
radiation–x rays, gamma rays and beta rays–are
potentially ionizing. Sound waves physically vibrate
the material through which they pass, but do not
ionize it.
Jaundice—A condition that results in a yellow tint to
the skin, eyes and body fluids. Bile retention in the
liver, gallbladder and pancreas is the immediate
cause, but the underlying cause could be as simple
as obstruction of the common bile duct by a gallstone or as serious as pancreatic cancer. Ultrasound
can distinguish between these conditions.
Malignant—The term literally means growing worse
and resisting treatment. It is used as a synonym for
cancerous and connotes a harmful condition that
generally is life-threatening.
Morphology—Literally, the study of form. In medicine, morphology refers to the size, shape and structure rather than the function of a given organ. As a
diagnostic imaging technique, ultrasound facilitates
the recognition of abnormal morphologies as symptoms of underlying conditions.

(1-10 MHz). Higher frequency ultrasound waves produce more detailed images, but are also more readily
absorbed and so cannot penetrate as deeply into the
body. Abdominal ultrasound imaging is generally performed at frequencies between 2-5 MHz.
3

Abdominal ultrasound

An ultrasound machine consists of two parts: the
transducer and the analyzer. The transducer both produces the sound waves that penetrate the body and
receives the reflected echoes. Transducers are built
around piezoelectric ceramic chips. (Piezoelectric
refers to electricity that is produced when you put
pressure on certain crystals such as quartz). These
ceramic chips react to electric pulses by producing
sound waves ( they are transmitting waves) and react
to sound waves by producing electric pulses (receiving). Bursts of high frequency electric pulses supplied
to the transducer causes it to produce the scanning
sound waves. The transducer then receives the returning echoes, translates them back into electric pulses
and sends them to the analyzer–a computer that organizes the data into an image on a television screen.
Because sound waves travel through all the body’s
tissues at nearly the same speed–about 3,400 miles per
hour–the microseconds it takes for each echo to be
received can be plotted on the screen as a distance into
the body. The relative strength of each echo, a function of the specific tissue or organ boundary that
produced it, can be plotted as a point of varying
brightness. In this way, the echoes are translated into
a picture. Tissues surrounded by bone or filled with
gas (the stomach, intestines and bowel) cannot be
imaged using ultrasound, because the waves are
blocked or become randomly scattered.
Four different modes of ultrasound are used in
medical imaging:


A-mode. This is the simplest type of ultrasound in
which a single transducer scans a line through the
body with the echoes plotted on screen as a function
of depth. This method is used to measure distances
within the body and the size of internal organs.
Therapeutic ultrasound aimed at a specific tumor
or calculus is also A-mode, to allow for pinpoint
accurate focus of the destructive wave energy.



B-mode. In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of
transducers simultaneously scans a plane through
the body that can be viewed as a two-dimensional
image on screen. Ultrasound probes containing more
than 100 transducers in sequence form the basis for
these most commonly used scanners, which cost
about $50,000.



M-Mode. The M stands for motion. A rapid
sequence of B-mode scans whose images follow
each other in sequence on screen enables doctors to
see and measure range of motion, as the organ
boundaries that produce reflections move relative
to the probe. M-mode ultrasound has been put to
particular use in studying heart motion.

4



Doppler mode. Doppler ultrasonography includes the
capability of accurately measuring velocities of moving material, such as blood in arteries and veins. The
principle is the same as that used in radar guns that
measure the speed of a car on the highway. Doppler
capability is most often combined with B-mode scanning to produce images of blood vessels from which
blood flow can be directly measured. This technique
is used extensively to investigate valve defects, arteriosclerosis and hypertension, particularly in the
heart, but also in the abdominal aorta and the portal
vein of the liver. These machines cost about
$250,000.

The actual procedure for a patient undergoing an
abdominal ultrasound is relatively simple, regardless
of the type of scan or its purpose. Fasting for at least
eight hours prior to the procedure ensures that the
stomach is empty and as small as possible, and that
the intestines and bowels are relatively inactive.
Fasting also allows the gall bladder to be seen, as it
contracts after eating and may not be seen if the stomach is full. In some cases, a full bladder helps to push
intestinal folds out of the way so that the gas they
contain does not disrupt the image. The patient’s
abdomen is then greased with a special gel that allows
the ultrasound probe to glide easily across the skin
while transmitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses.
This procedure is conducted by a doctor with the
assistance of a technologist skilled in operating the
equipment. The probe is moved around the abdomen
to obtain different views of the target areas. The
patient will likely be asked to change positions from
side to side and to hold their breath as necessary to
obtain the desired views. Discomfort during the procedure is minimal.
The many types and uses of ultrasound technology makes it difficult to generalize about the time and
costs involved. Relatively simple imaging–scanning a
suspicious abdominal mass or a suspected abdominal
aortic aneurysm–will take about half an hour to perform and will cost a few hundred dollars or more,
depending on the quality of the equipment, the
operator and other factors. More involved techniques
such as multiple M-mode and Doppler-enhanced
scans, or cases where the targets not well defined in
advance, generally take more time and are more
expensive.
Regardless of the type of scan used and the potential
difficulties encountered, ultrasound remains faster and
less expensive than computed tomography scans (CT),
its primary rival in abdominal imaging. Furthermore, as
abdominal ultrasounds are generally undertaken as
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Specific conditions for which ultrasound may be
selected as a treatment option–certain types of tumors,
lesions, kidney stones and other calculi, muscle and
ligament injuries, etc.–are described in detail under
the appropriate entries in this encyclopedia.

Preparation
A patient undergoing abdominal ultrasound will
be advised by their physician about what to expect and
how to prepare. As mentioned above, preparations
generally include fasting and arriving for the procedure with a full bladder, if necessary. This preparation
is particularly useful if the gallbladder, ovaries or veins
are to be examined.

Aftercare
In general, no aftercare related to the abdominal
ultrasound procedure itself is required.

Risks
Abdominal ultrasound carries with it no recognized risks or side effects, if properly performed using
appropriate frequency and intensity ranges. Sensitive
tissues, particularly those of the reproductive organs,
could possibly sustain damage if violently vibrated by
overly intense ultrasound waves. In general though,
such damage would only result from improper use of
the equipment.
Any woman who thinks she might be pregnant
should raise this issue with her doctor before undergoing an abdominal ultrasound, as a fetus in the early
stages of development could be injured by ultrasound
meant to probe deeply recessed abdominal organs.

Normal results
As a diagnostic imaging technique, a normal
abdominal ultrasound is one that indicates the absence
of the suspected condition that prompted the scan.
For example, symptoms such as a persistent cough,
labored breathing, and upper abdominal pain suggest
the possibility of, among other things, an abdominal
aortic aneurysm. An ultrasound scan that indicates
the absence of an aneurysm would rule out this lifeGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

threatening condition and point to other, less serious
causes.

Abnormal results
Because abdominal ultrasound imaging is generally undertaken to confirm a suspected condition, the
results of a scan often will prove abnormal–that is they
will confirm the diagnosis, be it kidney stones, cirrhosis of the liver or an aortic aneurysm. At that point,
appropriate medical treatment as prescribed by a
patient’s doctor is in order. See the relevant disease
and disorder entries in this encyclopedia for more
information.

I Abdominal wall defects
Definition
Abdominal wall defects are birth (congenital)
defects that allow the stomach or intestines to
protrude.

Description
Many unexpected and fascinating events occur
during the development of a fetus inside the womb.
The stomach and intestines begin development outside
the baby’s abdomen and only later does the abdominal
wall enclose them. Occasionally, either the umbilical
opening is too large, or it develops improperly, allowing the bowels or stomach to remain outside or
squeeze through the abdominal wall.
5

Abdominal wall defects

‘‘medically necessary’’ procedures designed to detect the
presence of suspected abnormalities, they are covered
under most types of major medical insurance. As always,
though, the patient would be wise to confirm that their
coverage extends to the specific procedure proposed.
For nonemergency situations, most underwriters stipulate prior approval as a condition of coverage.

Abortion, partial birth

Causes and symptoms
There are many causes for birth defects that still
remain unclear. Presently, the cause(s) of abdominal
wall defects is unknown, and any symptoms the
mother may have to indicate that the defects are present in the fetus are nondescript.

Diagnosis
At birth, the problem is obvious, because the base
of the umbilical cord at the navel will bulge or, in
worse cases, contain viscera (internal organs). Before
birth, an ultrasound examination may detect the problem. It is always necessary in children with one birth
defect to look for others, because birth defects are
usually multiple.

Treatment
Abdominal wall defects are effectively treated
with surgical repair. Unless there are accompanying
anomalies, the surgical procedure is not overly complicated. The organs are normal, just misplaced.
However, if the defect is large, it may be difficult to
fit all the viscera into the small abdominal cavity.

Prognosis
If there are no other defects, the prognosis after
surgical repair of this condition is relatively good.
However, 10% of those with more severe or additional
abnormalities die from it. The organs themselves
are fully functional; the difficulty lies in fitting them
inside the abdomen. The condition is, in fact, a hernia
requiring only replacement and strengthening of the
passageway through which it occurred. After surgery,
increased pressure in the stretched abdomen can compromise the function of the organs inside.

Prevention
Some, but by no means all, birth defects are preventable by early and attentive prenatal care, good
nutrition, supplemental vitamins, diligent avoidance
of all unnecessary drugs and chemicals–especially
tobacco–and other elements of a healthy lifestyle.

I Abortion, partial birth
Definition
Partial birth abortion is a method of late-term
(after 20 weeks) abortion that terminates a pregnancy
and results in the death and intact removal of a fetus.
This procedure is most commonly referred to as intact
dilatation and extraction (D & X). It occurs in a rare
percentage of pregnancies.

Purpose
Partial birth abortion, or D&X, is performed to
end a pregnancy and results in the death of a fetus,
typically in the late second or third trimester.
Although D&X is highly controversial, some physicians argue that it has advantages that make it a preferable procedure in some circumstances. One
perceived advantage is that the fetus is removed
largely intact, allowing for better evaluation and
autopsy of the fetus in cases of known fetal abnormalities. Intact removal of the fetus also may carry a lower
risk of puncturing the uterus or damaging the cervix.
Another perceived advantage is that D&X ends the
pregnancy without requiring the woman to go
through labor, which may be less emotionally traumatic than other methods of late-term abortion. In
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Precautions
Women considering D&X should be aware of the
highly controversial nature of this procedure. A controversy common to all late-term abortions is whether
the fetus is viable, or able to survive outside of the
woman’s body. A specific area of controversy with
D&X is that fetal death does not occur until after
most of the fetal body has exited the uterus. Several
states have taken legal action to limit or ban D&X and
many physicians who perform abortions do not perform D&X. This may restrict the availability of this
procedure to women seeking late-term abortions.
In March 2003, the United States Senate passed a
bill banning partial birth abortions and implementing
fines or maximum two-year jail terms for physicians
who perform them. In June 2003, the House approved
a ban as well. President George W. Bush signed the
legislation into law, but a federal judge declared the
law unconstitutional, so that the government had not
been able to enforce it. One of the opponents’ claims
was the legislation did not provide for exceptions for
cases in which the procedure was needed to protect the
mother’s health.

Description
Intact D&X, or partial birth abortion first
involves administration of medications to cause the
cervix to dilate, usually over the course of several
days. Next, the physician rotates the fetus to a footling
breech position. The body of the fetus is then drawn
out of the uterus feet first, until only the head remains
inside the uterus. Then, the physician uses an instrument to puncture the base of the skull, which collapses
the fetal head. Typically, the contents of the fetal head
are then partially suctioned out, which results in the
death of the fetus and reduces the size of the fetal head
enough to allow it to pass through the cervix. The dead
and otherwise intact fetus is then removed from the
woman’s body.

Preparation
Medical preparation for D&X involves an outpatient visit to administer medications, such as laminaria, to cause the cervix to begin dilating.
In addition, preparation may involve fulfilling
local legal requirements, such as a mandatory waiting
period, counseling, or an informed consent procedure
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Abortion, partial birth

addition, D&X may offer a lower cost and shorter
procedure time.

KEY TERMS
Cervix—The narrow outer end of the uterus that
separates the uterus from the vaginal canal.
Footling breech—A position of the fetus while in
the uterus where the feet of the fetus are nearest the
cervix and will be the first part of the fetus to exit the
uterus, with the head of the fetus being the last part
to exit the uterus.
Laminaria—A medical product made from a certain type of seaweed that is physically placed near
the cervix to cause it to dilate.

reviewing stages of fetal development, childbirth, alternative abortion methods, and adoption.

Aftercare
D&X typically does not require an overnight hospital stay, so a follow up appointment may be scheduled to monitor the woman for any complications.

Risks
With all abortion, the later in pregnancy an abortion is performed, the more complicated the procedure
and the greater the risk of injury to the woman. In
addition to associated emotional reactions, D&X carries the risk of injury to the woman, including heavy
bleeding, blood clots, damage to the cervix or uterus,
pelvic infection, and anesthesia-related complications.
There also is a risk of incomplete abortion, meaning
that the fetus is not dead when removed from the
woman’s body. Possible long-term risks include difficulty becoming pregnant or carrying a future pregnancy to term.

Normal results
The expected outcome of D&X is the termination
of a pregnancy with removal of a dead fetus from the
woman’s body.

I Abortion, selective
Definition
Selective abortion, also known as selective reduction, refers to choosing to abort a fetus, typically in a
multi-fetal pregnancy, to decrease the health risks to
the mother in carrying and giving birth to more than
one or two babies, and also to decrease the risk of
complications to the remaining fetus(es). The term
selective abortion also refers to choosing to abort a
fetus for reasons such as the woman is carrying a fetus
which likely will be born with some birth defect or
impairment, or because the sex of the fetus is not
preferred by the individual.

Purpose
A woman may decide to abort for health reasons,
for example, she is at higher risk for complications
during pregnancy because of a disorder or disease
such as diabetes. A 2004 case reported on an embryo
embedded in a cesarean section scar. Although rare, it
can be life threatening to the mother. In this care,
selective abortion was successful at saving the mother
and the remaining embryos.
However, selective reduction is recommended
often in cases of multi-fetal pregnancy, or the presence
of more than one fetus, typically, at least three or more
fetuses. In the general population, multi-fetal pregnancy happens in only about 1-2% of pregnant
women. But multi-fetal pregnancies occur far more
often in women using fertility drugs.

KEY TERMS
Multi-fetal pregnancy—A pregnancy of two or
more fetuses.
Selective reduction—Typically referred to in cases
of multifetal pregnancy, when one or more fetuses
are aborted to preserve the viability of the remaining fetuses and decrease health risks to the mother.

cases of multi-fetal pregnancy. Individuals engaging in
fertility treatment should be made aware of the risk of
multi-fetal pregnancy and consider the prospect of
recommended reduction before undergoing fertility
treatment.

Description
Selective reduction is usually performed between
nine and 12 weeks of pregnancy and is most successful
when performed in early pregnancy. It is a simple
procedure and can be performed on an outpatient
basis. A needle is inserted into the woman’s stomach
or vagina and potassium chloride is injected into the
fetus.

Preparation
Individuals who have chosen selective reduction
to safeguard the remaining fetuses should be counseled prior to the procedure. Individuals should
receive information regarding the risks of a multifetal pregnancy to both the fetuses and the mother
compared with the risks after the reduction.
Individuals seeking an abortion for any reason
should consider the ethical implications whether it be
because the fetus is not the preferred sex or because the
fetus would be born with a severe birth defect.

Aftercare
Counseling should continue after the abortion
because it is a traumatic event. Individuals may feel
guilty about choosing one fetus over another. Mental
health professionals should be consulted throughout
the process.

Precautions
Because women or couples who use fertility drugs
have made an extra effort to become pregnant, it is
possible that the individuals may be unwilling or
uncomfortable with the decision to abort a fetus in

gestational age and is used in determining the stage
of pregnancy. For example, a woman who is two
weeks late having her period is said to be six weeks
pregnant, because it is six weeks since she last
menstruated.
About 90% of women who have abortions do so
before 13 weeks and experience few complications.
Abortions performed between 13-24 weeks have a
higher rate of complications. Abortions after 24
weeks are extremely rare and are usually limited to
situations where the life of the mother is in danger.

or outpatient facilities if the procedure is performed
early in pregnancy. Women who have stable diabetes,
controlled epilepsy, mild to moderate high blood pressure, or who are HIV positive can often have abortions
as outpatients if precautions are taken. Women with
heart disease, previous endocarditis, asthma, lupus
erythematosus, uterine fibroid tumors, blood clotting
disorders, poorly controlled epilepsy, or some psychological disorders usually need to be hospitalized in
order to receive special monitoring and medications
during the procedure.

I Abortion, therapeutic
Definition
Therapeutic abortion is the intentional termination of a pregnancy before the fetus can live independently. Abortion has been a legal procedure in the
United States since 1973.

Purpose
An abortion may be performed whenever there is
some compelling reason to end a pregnancy. Women
have abortions because continuing the pregnancy
would cause them hardship, endanger their life or
health, or because prenatal testing has shown that
the fetus will be born with severe abnormalities.
Abortions are safest when performed within the
first six to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period.
The calculation of this date is referred to as the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Between five and seven weeks, a pregnancy can be
ended by a procedure called menstrual extraction.
This procedure is also sometimes called menstrual
regulation, mini-suction, or preemptive abortion.
The contents of the uterus are suctioned out through
a thin (3-4 mm) plastic tube that is inserted through the
undilated cervix. Suction is applied either by a bulb
syringe or a small pump.
Another method is called the ‘‘morning after’’ pill,
or emergency contraception. Basically, it involves taking high doses of birth control pills within 24 to 48
hours of having unprotected sex. The high doses of
hormones causes the uterine lining to change so that it
will not support a pregnancy. Thus, if the egg has been
fertilized, it is simply expelled from the body.
There are two types of emergency contraception.
One type is identical to ordinary birth control pills,
and uses the hormones estrogen and progestin). This
type is available with a prescription under the brand
name Preven. But women can even use their regular
birth control pills for emergency contraception, after
they check with their doctor about the proper dose.
About half of women who use birth control pills for

KEY TERMS
Endocarditis—An infection of the inner membrane
lining of the heart.
Fibroid tumors—Fibroid tumors are non-cancerous
(benign) growths in the uterus. They occur in
30-40% of women over age 40, and do not need
to be removed unless they are causing symptoms
that interfere with a woman’s normal activities.
Lupus erythematosus—A chronic inflammatory
disease in which inappropriate immune system
reactions cause abnormalities in the blood vessels
and connective tissue.
Prostaglandin—Oxygenated unsaturated cyclic
fatty acids responsible for various hormonal reactions such as muscle contraction.
Rh negative—Lacking the Rh factor, genetically
determined antigens in red blood cells that produce
immune responses. If an Rh negative woman is
pregnant with an Rh positive fetus, her body will
produce antibodies against the fetus’s blood, causing a disease known as Rh disease. Sensitization to
the disease occurs when the women’s blood is
exposed to the fetus’s blood. Rh immune globulin
(RhoGAM) is a vaccine that must be given to a
woman after an abortion, miscarriage, or prenatal
tests in order to prevent sensitization to Rh disease.

emergency contraception get nauseated and 20 percent
vomit. This method cuts the risk of pregnancy 75percent.
The other type of morning-after pill contains only
one hormone: progestin, and is available under the
brand name Plan B. It is more effective than the first
type with a lower risk of nausea and vomiting. It
reduces the risk of pregnancy 89 percent.
Women should check with their physicians
regarding the proper dose of pills to take, as it depends
on the brand of birth control pill. Not all birth control
pills will work for emergency contraception.
Menstrual extractions are safe, but because the
amount of fetal material is so small at this stage of
development, it is easy to miss. This results in an incomplete abortion that means the pregnancy continues.
First trimester abortions
The first trimester of pregnancy includes the first
13 weeks after the last menstrual period. In the United
States, about 90% of abortions are performed during
this period. It is the safest time in which to have an
abortion, and the time in which women have the most
choice of how the procedure is performed.
MEDICAL ABORTIONS. Medical abortions are
brought about by taking medications that end the
pregnancy. The advantages of a first trimester medical
abortion are:

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The procedure is non-invasive; no surgical instruments are used.



Anesthesia is not required.



Drugs are administered either orally or by injection.



The procedure resembles a natural miscarriage.
Disadvantages of a medical abortion are:



The effectiveness decreases after the seventh week.



The procedure may require multiple visits to the doctor.



Bleeding after the abortion lasts longer than after a
surgical abortion.



The woman may see the contents of her womb as it is
expelled.

Two different medications can be used to bring
about an abortion. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) works
by stopping fetal cells from dividing which causes the
fetus to die.
On the first visit to the doctor, the woman receives
an injection of methotrexate. On the second visit,
about a week later, she is given misoprostol
(Cytotec), an oxygenated unsaturated cyclic fatty
acid responsible for various hormonal reactions such
as muscle contraction (prostaglandin), that stimulates
contractions of the uterus. Within two weeks, the
woman will expel the contents of her uterus, ending
the pregnancy. A follow-up visit to the doctor is necessary to assure that the abortion is complete.
With this procedure, a woman will feel cramping
and may feel nauseated from the misoprostol. This
combination of drugs is 90-96% effective in ending
pregnancy.
Mifepristone (RU-486), which goes by the brand
name Mifeprex, works by blocking the action of progesterone, a hormone needed for pregnancy to continue, then stimulates ulerine contractions thus ending
the pregnancy. It can be taken as much as 49 days after
the first day of a woman’s last period. On the first visit
to the doctor, a woman takes a mifepristone pill. Two
days later she returns and, if the miscarriage has not
occurred, takes two misoprostol pills, which causes the
uterus to contract. Five percent of women won’t need
to take misoprostol. After an observation period, she
returns home.
Within four days, 90% of women have expelled
the contents of their uterus and completed the abortion. Within 14 days, 95-97% of women have completed the abortion. A third follow-up visit to the
doctor is necessary to confirm through observation
or ultrasound that the procedure is complete. In the
event that it is not, a surgical abortion is performed.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Studies show that 4.5 to 8 percent of women need
surgery or a blood transfusion after taking mifepristone, and the pregnancy persists in about 1 percent of
women. In this case, surgical abortion is recommended because the fetus may be damanged. Side
effects include nausea, vaginal bleeding and heavy
cramping. The bleeding is typically heavier than a
normal period and may last up to 16 days.
Mifepristone is not recommended for women with
ectopic pregnancy, an IUD, who have been taking
long-term steroidal therapy, have bleeding abnormalities or on blood-thinners such as Coumadin.
Surgical abortions
First trimester surgical abortions are performed
using vacuum aspiration. The procedure is also called
dilation and evacuation (D & E), suction dilation,
vacuum curettage, or suction curettage.
Advantages of a vacuum aspiration abortion are:


It is usually done as a one-day outpatient procedure.



The procedure takes only 10-15 minutes.



Bleeding after the abortion lasts five days or less.



The woman does not see the products of her womb
being removed.
Disadvantages include:



The procedure is invasive; surgical instruments are
used.



Infection may occur.

During a vacuum aspiration, the woman’s cervix
is gradually dilated by expanding rods inserted into
the cervical opening. Once dilated, a tube attached to a
suction pump is inserted through the cervix and the
contents of the uterus are suctioned out. The procedure is 97-99% effective. The amount of discomfort a
woman feels varies considerably. Local anesthesia is
often given to numb the cervix, but it does not mask
uterine cramping. After a few hours of rest, the woman
may return home.
Second trimester abortions
Although it is better to have an abortion during
the first trimester, some second trimester abortions
may be inevitable. The results of genetic testing are
often not available until 16 weeks. In addition,
women, especially teens, may not have recognized
the pregnancy or come to terms with it emotionally
soon enough to have a first trimester abortion. Teens
make up the largest group having second trimester
abortions.
11

Abortion, therapeutic



Abortion, therapeutic

Some second trimester abortions are performed
as a D & E. The procedures are similar to those used
in the first trimester, but a larger suction tube must be
used because more material must be removed. This
increases the amount of cervical dilation necessary and
increases the risk of the procedure. Many physicians are
reluctant to perform a D & E this late in pregnancy, and
for some women is it not a medically safe option.
The alternative to a D & E in the second trimester
is an abortion by induced labor. Induced labor may
require an overnight stay in a hospital. The day before
the procedure, the woman visits the doctor for tests,
and to either have rods inserted in her cervix to help
dilate it or to receive medication that will soften the
cervix and speed up labor.
On the day of the abortion, drugs, usually prostaglandins to induce contractions, and a salt water
solution, are injected into the uterus. Contractions
begin, and within eight to 72 hours the woman delivers
the fetus.
Side effects of this procedure include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea from the prostaglandins, and pain
from uterine cramps. Anesthesia of the sort used in
childbirth can be given to mask the pain. Many women
are able to go home a few hours after the procedure.
Very early abortions cost between $200-$400.
Later abortions cost more. The cost increases about
$100 per week between the thirteenth and sixteenth
week. Second trimester abortions are much more
costly because they often involve more risk, more
services, anesthesia, and sometimes a hospital stay.
Insurance carriers and HMOs may or may not cover
the procedure. Federal law prohibits federal funds
including Medicaid funds, from being used to pay for
an elective abortion.

Preparation
The doctor must know accurately the stage of a
woman’s pregnancy before an abortion is performed.
The doctor will ask the woman questions about her
menstrual cycle and also do a physical examination to
confirm the stage of pregnancy. This may be done at
an office visit before the abortion or on the day of the
abortion. Some states require a waiting period before
an abortion can be performed. Others require parental
or court consent for a child under age 18 to receive an
abortion.
Despite the fact that almost half of all women
in the United States have had at least one abortion
by the time they reach age 45, abortion is surrounded
by controversy. Women often find themselves in
12

emotional turmoil when deciding if an abortion is
a procedure they wish to undergo. Pre-abortion counseling is important in helping a woman resolve any
questions she may have about having the procedure.

Aftercare
Regardless of the method used to perform the
abortion, a woman will be observed for a period of
time to make sure her blood pressure is stable and
that bleeding is controlled. The doctor may prescribe
antibiotics to reduce the chance of infection. Women
who are Rh negative (lacking genetically determined
antigens in their red blood cells that produce immune
responses) should be given a human Rh immune
globulin (RhoGAM) after the procedure unless the
father of the fetus is also Rh negative. This prevents
blood incompatibility complications in future
pregnancies.
Bleeding will continue for about five days in a
surgical abortion and longer in a medical abortion.
To decrease the risk of infection, a woman should
avoid intercourse and not use tampons and douches
for two weeks after the abortion.
A follow-up visit is a necessary part of the
woman’s aftercare. Contraception will be offered to
women who wish to avoid future pregnancies, because
menstrual periods normally resume within a few
weeks.

Risks
Serious complications resulting from abortions
performed before 13 weeks are rare. Of the 90% of
women who have abortions in this time period, 2.5%
have minor complications that can be handled without
hospitalization. Less than 0.5% have complications
that require a hospital stay. The rate of complications
increases as the pregnancy progresses.
Complications from abortions can include:


uncontrolled bleeding



infection



blood clots accumulating in the uterus



a tear in the cervix or uterus



missed abortion where the pregnancy continues



incomplete abortion where some material from the
pregnancy remains in the uterus

Women who experience any of the following
symptoms of post-abortion complications should call
the clinic or doctor who performed the abortion
immediately.

containing digested germs, digested tissue, white
blood cells, and enzymes.
An abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection
that begins with a process called inflammation.
Initially, as the invading germ activates the body’s
immune system, several events occur:


Blood flow to the area increases.



The temperature of the area increases due to the
increased blood supply.



I Abscess

The area swells due to the accumulation of water,
blood, and other liquids.



It turns red.

Definition



It hurts, because of the irritation from the swelling
and the chemical activity.

Abruptio placentae see Placental abruption

An abscess is an enclosed collection of liquefied
tissue, known as pus, somewhere in the body. It is the
result of the body’s defensive reaction to foreign
material.

Description
There are two types of abscesses, septic and sterile.
Most abscesses are septic, which means that they are
the result of an infection. Septic abscesses can occur
anywhere in the body. Only a germ and the body’s
immune response are required. In response to the
invading germ, white blood cells gather at the infected
site and begin producing chemicals called enzymes
that attack the germ by digesting it. These enzymes
act like acid, killing the germs and breaking them
down into small pieces that can be picked up by
the circulation and eliminated from the body.
Unfortunately, these chemicals also digest body tissues. In most cases, the germ produces similar chemicals. The result is a thick, yellow liquid–pus–
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

These four signs–heat, swelling, redness, and
pain–characterize inflammation.
As the process progresses, the tissue begins to turn
to liquid, and an abscess forms. It is the nature of an
abscess to spread as the chemical digestion liquefies
more and more tissue. Furthermore, the spreading
follows the path of least resistance–the tissues most
easily digested. A good example is an abscess just
beneath the skin. It most easily continues along
beneath the skin rather than working its way through
the skin where it could drain its toxic contents. The
contents of the abscess also leak into the general circulation and produce symptoms just like any other
infection. These include chills, fever, aching, and
general discomfort.
Sterile abscesses are sometimes a milder form
of the same process caused not by germs but by nonliving irritants such as drugs. If an injected drug
like penicillin is not absorbed, it stays where it was

Specific types of abscesses

KEY TERMS
Cellulitis—Inflammation of tissue due to infection.
Enzyme—Any of a number of protein chemicals
that can change other chemicals.

Listed below are some of the more common and
important abscesses.


Carbuncles and other boils. Skin oil glands (sebaceous glands) on the back or the back of the neck
are the ones usually infected. The most common
germ involved is Staphylococcus aureus. Acne is a
similar condition of sebaceous glands on the face
and back.



Pilonidal abscess. Many people have as a birth defect
a tiny opening in the skin just above the anus. Fecal
bacteria can enter this opening, causing an infection
and subsequent abscess.



Retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, peritonsillar
abscess. As a result of throat infections like strep
throat and tonsillitis, bacteria can invade the deeper
tissues of the throat and cause an abscess. These
abscesses can compromise swallowing and even
breathing.



Lung abscess. During or after pneumonia, whether
it’s due to bacteria [common pneumonia], tuberculosis, fungi, parasites, or other germs, abscesses can
develop as a complication.



Liver abscess. Bacteria or amoeba from the intestines
can spread through the blood to the liver and cause
abscesses.



Psoas abscess. Deep in the back of the abdomen on
either side of the lumbar spine lie the psoas muscles.
They flex the hips. An abscess can develop in one of
these muscles, usually when it spreads from the
appendix, the large bowel, or the fallopian tubes.

Fallopian tubes—Part of the internal female anatomy that carries eggs from the ovaries to the uterus.
Flora—Living inhabitants of a region or area.
Pyogenic—Capable of generating pus. Streptococcus,
Staphocococcus, and bowel bacteria are the primary
pyogenic organisms.
Sebaceous glands—Tiny structures in the skin that
produce oil (sebum). If they become plugged,
sebum collects inside and forms a nurturing place
for germs to grow.

throughout the body by means of the blood stream.

injected and may cause enough irritation to generate
a sterile abscess–sterile because there is no infection
involved. Sterile abscesses are quite likely to turn into
hard, solid lumps as they scar, rather than remaining
pockets of pus.

Causes and symptoms
Many different agents cause abscesses. The most
common are the pus-forming (pyogenic) bacteria like
Staphylococcus aureus, which is nearly always the
cause of abscesses under the skin. Abscesses near
the large bowel, particularly around the anus, may
be caused by any of the numerous bacteria found
within the large bowel. Brain abscesses and liver
abscesses can be caused by any organism that can
travel there through the circulation. Bacteria,
amoeba, and certain fungi can travel in this fashion.
Abscesses in other parts of the body are caused by
organisms that normally inhabit nearby structures or
that infect them. Some common causes of specific
abscesses are:


skin abscesses by normal skin flora



dental and throat abscesses by mouth flora



lung abscesses by normal airway flora, pneumonia
germs, or tuberculosis



abdominal and anal abscesses by normal bowel
flora

14

Diagnosis
The common findings of inflammation–heat, redness, swelling, and pain–easily identify superficial
abscesses. Abscesses in other places may produce
only generalized symptoms such as fever and discomfort. If the patient’s symptoms and physical examination do not help, a physician may have to resort to a
battery of tests to locate the site of an abscess, but
usually something in the initial evaluation directs the
search. Recent or chronic disease in an organ suggests
it may be the site of an abscess. Dysfunction of an
organ or system–for instance, seizures or altered bowel
function–may provide the clue. Pain and tenderness
on physical examination are common findings.
Sometimes a deep abscess will eat a small channel
(sinus) to the surface and begin leaking pus. A sterile
abscess may cause only a painful lump deep in the
buttock where a shot was given.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Since skin is very resistant to the spread of infection, it acts as a barrier, often keeping the toxic
chemicals of an abscess from escaping the body on
their own. Thus, the pus must be drained from the
abscess by a physician. The surgeon determines when
the abscess is ready for drainage and opens a path to
the outside, allowing the pus to escape. Ordinarily, the
body handles the remaining infection, sometimes with
the help of antibiotics or other drugs. The surgeon may
leave a drain (a piece of cloth or rubber) in the abscess
cavity to prevent it from closing before all the pus has
drained out.

Alternative treatment
If an abscess is directly beneath the skin, it will be
slowly working its way through the skin as it is more
rapidly working its way elsewhere. Since chemicals
work faster at higher temperatures, applications of
hot compresses to the skin over the abscess will hasten
the digestion of the skin and eventually result in its
breaking down, releasing the pus spontaneously. This
treatment is best reserved for smaller abscesses in relatively less dangerous areas of the body–limbs, trunk,
back of the neck. It is also useful for all superficial
abscesses in their very early stages. It will ‘‘ripen’’
them.
Contrast hydrotherapy, alternating hot and
cold compresses, can also help assist the body in
resorption of the abscess. There are two homeopathic remedies that work to rebalance the body in
relation to abscess formation, Silica and Hepar
sulphuris. In cases of septic abscesses, bentonite
clay packs (bentonite clay and a small amount of
Hydrastis powder) can be used to draw the infection
from the area.

case, the result is life threatening. Blood poisoning is a
term commonly used to describe an infection that has
spilled into the blood stream and spread throughout
the body from a localized origin. Blood poisoning,
known to physicians as septicemia, is also life
threatening.
Of special note, abscesses in the hand are more
serious than they might appear. Due to the intricate
structure and the overriding importance of the hand,
any hand infection must be treated promptly and
competently.

Prevention
Infections that are treated early with heat (if
superficial) or antibiotics will often resolve without
the formation of an abscess. It is even better to avoid
infections altogether by taking prompt care of open
injuries, particularly puncture wounds. Bites are the
most dangerous of all, even more so because they
often occur on the hand.

Once the abscess is properly drained, the prognosis is excellent for the condition itself. The reason

infection to heal.

Purpose
An abscess is a pus-filled sore, usually caused by a
bacterial infection. The pus is made up of both live and
dead organisms and destroyed tissue from the white
blood cells that were carried to the area to fight the
infection. Abscesses are often found in the soft tissue
under the skin, such as the armpit or the groin.

Although abscesses are often found in the soft tissue under the skin, such as the armpit or the groin, they may develop in any
organ, such as the liver. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)

However, they may develop in any organ, and are
commonly found in the breast and gums. Abscesses
are far more serious and call for more specific treatment if they are located in deep organs such as the
lung, liver or brain.
Because the lining of the abscess cavity tends
to interfere with the amount of the drug that can
penetrate the source of infection from the blood, the
cavity itself may require draining. Once an abscess has
fully formed, it often does not respond to antibiotics.
Even if the antibiotic does penetrate into the abscess, it
doesn’t function as well in that environment.

Precautions
An abscess can usually be diagnosed visually,
although an imaging technique such as a computed
tomography scan may be used to confirm the extent of
the abscess before drainage. Such procedures may also
be needed to localize internal abscesses, such as those
in the abdominal cavity or brain.

KEY TERMS
White blood cells—Cells that protect the body
against infection.

Description
A doctor will cut into the lining of the abscess,
allowing the pus to escape either through a drainage
tube or by leaving the cavity open to the skin. How big
the incision is depends on how quickly the pus is
encountered.
Once the abscess is opened, the doctor will clean
and irrigate the wound thoroughly with saline. If it is
not too large or deep, the doctor may simply pack the
abscess wound with gauze for 24–48 hours to absorb
the pus and discharge.
If it is a deeper abscess, the doctor may insert a
drainage tube after cleaning out the wound. Once the

Preparation
The skin over the abscess will be cleansed by
swabbing gently with an antiseptic solution.

Aftercare
Much of the pain around the abscess will be gone
after the surgery. Healing is usually very fast. After the
tube is taken out, antibiotics may be continued for
several days. Applying heat and keeping the affected
area elevated may help relieve inflammation.

Risks
If there is any scarring, it is likely to become much
less noticeable as time goes on, and eventually almost
invisible. Occasionally, an abscess within a vital organ
(such as the brain) damages enough surrounding tissue
that there is some permanent loss of normal function.

Normal results
Most abscesses heal after drainage alone; others
require drainage and antibiotic drug treatment.

I Abuse

Description
Physical abuse of a child is the infliction of injury
by another person. The injuries can include punching,
kicking, biting, burning, beating, or pulling the victim’s hair. The physical abuse inflicted on a child can
result in bruises, burns, poisoning, broken bones, and
internal hemorrhages. Physical assault against an
adult primarily occurs with women, usually in the
form of domestic violence. It is estimated that approximately three million children witness domestic violence every year.
Sexual abuse of a child refers to sexual behavior
between an adult and child or between two children,
one of whom is dominant or significantly older. The
sexual behaviors can include touching breasts, genitals, and buttocks; either dressed or undressed. The
behavior also can include exhibitionism, cunnilingus,
fellatio, or penetration of the vagina or anus with
sexual organs or objects.
Pornographic photography also is used in sexual
abuse with children. Reported sex offenders are 97%
male. Reports of child pornography have increased
since with the popularity of the Internet. Females
more often are perpetrators in child-care settings,
since children may confuse sexual abuse by a female
with normal hygiene care. The 1990s and early 2000s
were rocked by reports of sexual abuse of children
committed by Catholic priests. Most of the abuse
appeared to have occurred during the 1970s and a
prominent report released early in 2004 stated that as
many as 10.667 children were sexually abused by more
than 4,300 priests. Sexual abuse by stepfathers is five
times more common than with biological fathers.
Sexual abuse of daughters by stepfathers or fathers is
the most common form of incest.
Sexual abuse also can take the form of rape. The
legal definition of rape includes only slight penile
penetration in the victim’s outer vulva area.
Complete erection and ejaculation are not necessary.
Rape is the perpetration of an act of sexual intercourse
whether:


will is overcome by force or fear (from threats or by
use of drugs).



mental impairment renders the victim incapable of
rational judgment.



if the victim is below the legal age established for
consent.

Definition
Abuse is defined as anything that is harmful,
injurious, or offensive. Abuse also includes excessive
and wrongful misuse of a substance. There are several
major types of abuse: physical and sexual abuse of a
child or an adult, substance abuse, elderly abuse, and
emotional abuse.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Substance abuse is an abnormal pattern of substance usage leading to significant distress or impairment. The criteria include one or more of the following

Encopresis—Abnormalities relating to bowel
movements that can occur as a result of stress or
fear.



obligations at home, work, or school.



using substance in situations that are physically dangerous (i.e., while driving).



recurrent substance-related legal problems.



continued usage despite recurrent social and interpersonal problems (i.e., arguments and fights with
significant other).

Abuse of the elderly is common and occurs mostly
as a result of caretaker burnout, due to the high level
of dependency frail, elderly patients usually require.
Abuse can be manifested by physical signs, fear, and
delaying or not reporting the need for advanced medical care. Elderly patients also may exhibit financial
abuse (money or possessions taken away) and
abandonment.
Emotional abuse generally continues even after
physical assaults have stopped. In most cases it is a
personally tailored form of verbal or gesture abuse
expressed to illicit a provoked response.

Causes and symptoms
Children who have been abused usually have a
variety of symptoms that encompass behavioral, emotional, and psychosomatic problems (body problems
caused by emotional or mental disturbance). Children
who have been physically abused tend to be more
aggressive, angry, hostile, depressed, and have low
self-esteem. Additionally, they exhibit fear, anxiety,
and nightmares. Severe psychological problems may
result in suicidal behavior or posttraumatic stress disorder. Physically abused children may complain of
physical illness even in the absence of a cause. They
also may suffer from eating disorders and encopresis,
or involuntary defecation caused or psychic origin.
Children who are sexually abused may exhibit abnormal sexual behavior in the form of aggressiveness and
hyperarousal. Adolescents may display promiscuity,
sexual acting out, and—in some situations—homosexual contact.
Physical abuse directed towards adults can ultimately lead to death. Approximately 50% of women
18

murdered in the United States were killed by a former
or current male partner. Approximately one-third of
emergency room consultations by women were
prompted due to domestic violence. Female victims
who are married also have a higher rate of internal
injuries and unconsciousness than victims of stranger
assault (mugging, robbery). Physical abuse or rape
also can occur between married persons and persons
of the same gender. Perpetrators usually sexually
assault their victims to dominate, hurt, and debase
them. It is common for physical and sexual violence
to occur at the same time. A large percentage of sexually assaulted persons were also physically abused in
the form of punching, beating, or threatening the victim with a weapon such as a gun or knife. Usually
males who are hurt and humiliated tend to physically
assault people whom they are intimately involved
with, such as spouses and/or children. Males who
assault a female tend to have experienced or witnessed
violence during childhood. They also tend to abuse
alcohol, to be sexually assaultive, and are at increased
risk for assaultive behavior directed against children.
Jealous males tend to monitor a women’s movements
and whereabouts and to isolate other sources of protection and support. They interpret their behavior as
betrayal of trust and this causes resentment and explosive anger outbursts during periods of losing control.
Males also may use aggression against females in an
effort to control and intimidate partners.
Abuse in the elderly usually occurs in the frail,
elderly community. The caretaker is usually the perpetrator. Caretaker abuse can be suspected if there is
evidence suggesting behavioral changes in the elderly
person when the caretaker is present. Additionally,
elderly abuse can be possible if there are delays
between injuries and treatment, inconsistencies
between injury and explanations, lack of hygiene or
clothing, and prescriptions not being filled.

Diagnosis
Children who are victims of domestic violence
frequently are injured attempting to protect their
mother from an abusive partner. Injuries are visible
by inspection or self-report. Physical abuse of an adult
may also be evident by inspection with visible cuts
and/or bruises or self-report.
Sexual abuse of both a child and an adult can be
diagnosed with a history from the victim. Victims can
be assessed for signs of ejaculatory evidence from the
perpetrator. Ejaculatory specimens can be retrieved
from the mouth, rectum, and clothing. Tests for sexually transmitted diseases may be performed.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Substance abuse can be suspected in a person who
continues to indulge in their drug of choice despite
recurrent negative consequences. The diagnosis can
be made after administration of a comprehensive
exam and standardized chemical abuse assessments
by a therapist.

Treatment
Children who are victims of physical or sexual
abuse typically require psychological support and
medical attention. A complaint may be filed with the
local family social services agency that will initiate
investigations. The authorities usually will follow up
the allegation or offense. Children may also be
referred for psychological evaluation and/or treatment. The victim also may be placed in foster care
pending the investigation outcome. The police also
may investigate physical and sexual abuse of an
adult. The victim may require immediate medical
care and long-term psychological treatment. It is common for children to be adversely affected by domestic
violence situations and the local family services agency
may be involved.
Substance abusers should elect treatment, either
inpatient or outpatient, depending on severity of
addiction. Long term treatment and/or medications
may be utilized to assist in abstinence. The patient
should be encouraged to participate in community
centered support groups.

Prognosis
The prognosis depends on the diagnosis.
Usually victims of physical and sexual abuse require
therapy to deal with emotional distress associated
with the incident. Perpetrators require further psychological evaluation and treatment. Victims of
abuse may have a variety of emotional problems
including depression, acts of suicide, or anxiety.
Children of sexual abuse may enter abusive relationships or have problems with intimacy as adults.
The substance abuser may experience relapses, since
the cardinal feature of all addictive disorders is a
tendency to return to symptoms. Elderly patients
may suffer from further medical problems and/or
anxiety, and in some cases neglect may precipitate
death.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Prevention
Prevention programs are geared to education and
awareness. Detection of initial symptoms or characteristic behaviors may assist in some situations. In
some cases treatment may be sought before incident.
The professional treating the abused persons must
develop a clear sense of the relationship dynamics
and the chances for continued harm.

I Acetaminophen
Definition
Acetaminophen is a medicine used to relieve pain
and reduce fever.

Purpose
Acetaminophen is used to relieve many kinds of
minor aches and pains—headaches, muscle aches,
backaches, toothaches, menstrual cramps, arthritis,
and the aches and pains that often accompany colds.
19

Acetaminophen

Elderly abuse can be suspected if the elderly patient
demonstrates a fear of the caretaker. Additionally,
elderly abuse can be suspected if there are signs indicating intentional delay of required medical care or a
change in medical status.

Acetaminophen

Description
This drug is available without a prescription.
Acetaminophen is sold under various brand names,
including Tylenol, Panadol, Aspirin Free Anacin, and
Bayer Select Maximum Strength Headache Pain Relief
Formula. Many multi-symptom cold, flu, and sinus
medicines also contain acetaminophen. The ingredients listing on the container should state if acetaminophen is included in the product.
Studies have shown that acetaminophen relieves
pain and reduces fever about as well as aspirin. But
differences between these two common drugs exist.
Acetaminophen is less likely than aspirin to irritate
the stomach. However, unlike aspirin, acetaminophen
does not reduce the redness, stiffness, or swelling that
accompany arthritis.

Recommended dosage
The usual dosage for adults and children age 12
and over is 325-650 mg every four to six hours as
needed. No more than 4 grams (4000 mg) should be
taken in 24 hours. Because the drug can potentially
harm the liver, people who drink alcohol in large
quantities should take considerably less acetaminophen and possibly should avoid the drug completely.
For children ages 6-11 years, the usual dose is 150300 mg, three to four times a day. A physician should
recommend doses for children under age 6 years.

Precautions
In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) launched an advertising campaign aimed at
educating consumers about proper use of acetaminophen and other over-the-counter pain killers. Often,
acetaminophen is hidden in many cold and flu products
and people unexpectedly overdose on the medicine.
Some cases have led to liver transplantation or death.
More than the recommended dosage of acetaminophen
should not be taken unless told to do so by a physician
or dentist.
Patients should not use acetaminophen for more
than 10 days to relieve pain (five days for children) or
for more than three days to reduce fever, unless directed to do so by a physician. If symptoms do not go
away—or if they get worse— a physician should be
contacted. Anyone who drinks three or more alcoholic
beverages a day should check with a physician before
using this drug and should never take more than the
recommended dosage. A risk of liver damage exists
from combining large amounts of alcohol and

acetaminophen. People who already have kidney or
liver disease or liver infections should also consult with
a physician before using the drug. So should women
who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
Many drugs can interact with one another. A
physician or pharmacist should be consulted before
combining acetaminophen with any other medicine.
Two different acetaminophen-containing products
should not be used at the same time.
Acetaminophen interferes with the results of some
medical tests. Avoiding the drug for a few days before
the tests may be necessary.

Side effects
Acetaminophen causes few side effects. The most
common one is lightheadedness. Some people may
experience trembling and pain in the side or the
lower back. Allergic reactions occur in some people,
but are rare. Anyone who develops symptoms such as
a rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing after taking
acetaminophen should stop taking the drug and get
immediate medical attention. Other rare side effects
include yellow skin or eyes, unusual bleeding or bruising, weakness, fatigue, bloody or black stools, bloody
or cloudy urine, and a sudden decrease in the amount
of urine.
Overdoses of acetaminophen may cause nausea,
vomiting, sweating, and exhaustion. Very large overdoses can cause liver damage. In case of an overdose,
immediate medical attention should be sought. In
2004, researchers announced that an injection to counteract the liver injury caused by acetaminophen overdose has been approved by the FDA.

Interactions
Acetaminophen may interact with a variety of
other medicines. When this happens, the effects of one
or both of the drugs may change or the risk of side
effects may be greater. Among the drugs that may
interact with acetaminophen are alcohol, nonsteroidal

Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is the most
common symptom of achalasia. The person with
achalasia usually has trouble swallowing both liquid
and solid foods, often feeling that food ‘‘gets stuck’’
on the way down. The person has chest pain that
is often mistaken for angina pectoris (cardiac pain).
Heartburn and difficulty belching are common.
Symptoms usually get steadily worse. Other symptoms
may include nighttime cough or recurrent pneumonia
caused by food passing into the lower airways.

I Achalasia
Definition

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of achalasia begins with a careful medical history. The history should focus on the timing of
symptoms and on eliminating other medical conditions that may cause similar symptoms. Tests used to
diagnose achalasia include:


Esophageal manometry. In this test, a thin tube is
passed into the esophagus to measure the pressure
exerted by the esophageal sphincter.



X ray of the esophagus. Barium may be swallowed to
act as a contrast agent. Barium reveals the outlines of
the esophagus in greater detail and makes it easier to
see its constriction at the sphincter.



Endoscopy. In this test, a tube containing a lens and a
light source is passed into the esophagus. Endoscopy is
used to look directly at the surface of the esophagus.
This test can also detect tumors that cause symptoms
like those of achalasia. Cancer of the esophagus occurs
as a complication of achalasia in 2-7% of patients.

Achalasia is a disorder of the esophagus that
prevents normal swallowing.

Description
Achalasia affects the esophagus, the tube that
carries swallowed food from the back of the throat
down into the stomach. A ring of muscle called the
lower esophageal sphincter encircles the esophagus
just above the entrance to the stomach. This sphincter
muscle is normally contracted to close the esophagus.
When the sphincter is closed, the contents of the stomach cannot flow back into the esophagus. Backward
flow of stomach contents (reflux) can irritate and
inflame the esophagus, causing symptoms such as
heartburn. The act of swallowing causes a wave of
esophageal contraction called peristalsis. Peristalsis
pushes food along the esophagus. Normally, peristalsis causes the esophageal sphincter to relax and allow
food into the stomach. In achalasia, which means
‘‘failure to relax,’’ the esophageal sphincter remains
contracted. Normal peristalsis is interrupted and food
cannot enter the stomach.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment
The first-line treatment for achalasia is balloon
dilation. In this procedure, an inflatable membrane
or balloon is passed down the esophagus to the sphincter and inflated to force the sphincter open. Dilation is
effective in about 70% of patients.
Three other treatments are used for achalasia when
balloon dilation is inappropriate or unacceptable.
21

Achalasia

anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Motrin,
oral contraceptives, the antiseizure drug phenytoin
(Dilantin), the blood-thinning drug warfarin
(Coumadin), the cholesterol-lowering drug cholestyramine (Questran), the antibiotic Isoniazid, and zidovudine (Retrovir, AZT). A physician or pharmacist
should be consulted before combining acetaminophen
with any other prescription or nonprescription (overthe-counter) medicine.

it to relax. Symptoms usually return within one to
two years.

Esophagomyotomy. This surgical procedure cuts the
sphincter muscle to allow the esophagus to open.
Esophagomyotomy is becoming more popular with
the development of techniques allowing very small
abdominal incisions.

reduces muscle contraction. Taken daily, this drug
provides relief for about two-thirds of patients for as
long as two years.

I Achondroplasia
Definition
Achondroplasia is the most common cause of
dwarfism, or significantly abnormal short stature.

Description
Achondroplasia is one of a number of chondodystrophies, in which the development of cartilage,
and therefore, bone is disturbed. The disorder
appears in approximately one in every 10,000
births. Achondroplasia is usually diagnosed at birth,
owing to the characteristic appearance of the
newborn.
Normal bone growth depends on the production of cartilage (a fibrous connective tissue). Over
time, calcium is deposited within the cartilage,
causing it to harden and become bone. In achondroplasia, abnormalities of this process prevent the
bones (especially those in the limbs) from growing
as long as they normally should, at the same time
allowing the bones to become abnormally thickened. The bones in the trunk of the body and the
skull are mostly not affected, although the opening
from the skull through which the spinal cord
passes (foramen magnum) is often narrower than
normal, and the opening (spinal canal) through
which the spinal cord runs in the back bones (vertebrae) becomes increasingly and abnormally small
down the length of the spine.

Causes and symptoms
Prognosis
Most patients with achalasia can be treated effectively. Achalasia does not reduce life expectancy
unless esophageal carcinoma develops.
22

Achondroplasia is caused by a genetic defect. It is
a dominant trait, meaning that anybody with
the genetic defect will display all the symptoms of
the disorder. A parent with the disorder has a 50%

Cartilage—A flexible, fibrous type of connective
tissue which serves as a base on which bone is

Foramen magnum—The opening at the base of the
skull, through which the spinal cord and the brainstem pass.
Hydrocephalus—An abnormal accumulation of
fluid within the brain. This accumulation can be
destructive by pressing on brain structures, and
damaging them.
Mutation—A new, permanent change in the structure of a gene, which can result in abnormal structure or function somewhere in the body.
Spinal canal—The opening that runs through the
center of the column of spinal bones (vertebrae),
and through which the spinal cord passes.

chance of passing it on to the offspring. Although
achondroplasia can be passed on to subsequent
offspring, the majority of cases occur due to a new
mutation (change) in a gene. Interestingly enough,
the defect seen in achondroplasia is one of only a
few defects known to increase in frequency with
increasing age of the father (many genetic defects are
linked to increased age of the mother).
People with achondroplasia have abnormally
short arms and legs. Their trunk is usually of normal
size, as is their head. The appearance of short limbs
and normal head size actually makes the head
appear to be oversized. The bridge of the nose
often has a scooped out appearance termed ‘‘saddle
nose.’’ The lower back has an abnormal curvature,
or sway back. The face often displays an overly
prominent forehead, and a relative lack of development of the face in the area of the upper jaw. Because
the foramen magnum and spinal canal are abnormally narrowed, nerve damage may occur if the
spinal cord or nerves become compressed. The narrowed foramen magnum may disrupt the normal
flow of fluid between the brain and the spinal cord,
resulting in the accumulation of too much fluid in
the brain (hydrocephalus). Children with achondroplasia have a very high risk of serious and repeated
middle ear infections, which can result in hearing
loss. The disease does not affect either mental capacity, or reproductive ability.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Vertebrae—The individual bones of the spinal column which are stacked on top of each other. There
is a hole in the center of each bone, through which
the spinal cord passes.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is often made at birth due to the characteristically short limbs, and the appearance of a
large head. X-ray examination will reveal a characteristic appearance to the bones, with the bones of the
limbs appearing short in length, yet broad in width. A
number of measurements of the bones in x-ray images
will reveal abnormal proportions.

Treatment
No treatment will reverse the defect present in
achondroplasia. All patients with the disease will be
short, with abnormally proportioned limbs, trunk,
and head. Treatment of achondroplasia primarily
addresses some of the complications of the disorder,
including problems due to nerve compression, hydrocephalus, bowed legs, and abnormal curves in the
spine. Children with achondroplasia who develop
middle ear infections (acute otitis media) will require
quick treatment with antibiotics and careful monitoring in order to avoid hearing loss.

Prognosis
Achondroplasia is a disease which causes considerable deformity. However, with careful attention

Tissues other than prostate have small amounts
of acid phosphatase, including bone, liver, spleen,
kidney, and red blood cells and platelets. Damage to
these tissues causes a moderate increase in acid phosphatase levels.

Description

I Acid phosphatase test
Definition
Acid phosphatase is an enzyme found throughout
the body, but primarily in the prostate gland. Like all
enzymes, it is needed to trigger specific chemical reactions. Acid phosphatase testing is done to diagnose
whether prostate cancer has spread to other parts of
the body (metastasized), and to check the effectiveness
of treatment. The test has been largely supplanted by
the prostate specific antigen test (PSA).

Purpose
The male prostate gland has 100 times more
acid phosphatase than any other body tissue.
When prostate cancer spreads to other parts of the
body, acid phosphatase levels rise, particularly if
the cancer spreads to the bone. One-half to threefourths of persons who have metastasized prostate
cancer have high acid phosphatase levels. Levels fall
after the tumor is removed or reduced through
treatment.
24

Laboratory testing measures the amount of acid
phosphatase in a person’s blood, and can determine
from what tissue the enzyme is coming. For example, it
is important to know if the increased acid phosphatase
is from the prostate or red blood cells. Acid phosphatase from the prostate, called prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), is the most medically significant type of
acid phosphatase.
Subtle differences between prostatic acid phosphatase and acid phosphatases from other tissues
cause them to react differently in the laboratory
when mixed with certain chemicals. For example,
adding the chemical tartrate to the test mixture inhibits the activity of prostatic acid phosphatase but not
red blood cell acid phosphatase. Laboratory test
methods based on these differences reveal how
much of a person’s total acid phosphatase is derived
from the prostate. Results are usually available the
next day.

Preparation
This test requires drawing about 5-10 mL of blood.
The patient should not have a rectal exam or prostate
massage for two to three days prior to the test.

Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site, and the person may feel dizzy or faint. Applying
pressure to the puncture site until the bleeding stops
will reduce bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site
will relieve discomfort.

Normal results
Normal results vary based on the laboratory and
the method used.

Abnormal results
The highest levels of acid phosphatase are found
in metastasized prostate cancer. Diseases of the
bone, such as Paget’s disease or hyperparathyroidism;
diseases of blood cells, such as sickle cell disease or
multiple myeloma; or lysosomal disorders, such as
Gaucher’s disease, will show moderately increased
levels.
Certain medications can cause temporary increases
or decreases in acid phosphatase levels. Manipulation
of the prostate gland through massage, biopsy, or rectal
exam before a test can increase the level.

Acne vulgaris, the medical term for common acne,
is the most common skin disease. It affects nearly 17
million people in the United States. While acne can
arise at any age, it usually begins at puberty and worsens during adolescence. Nearly 85% of people
develop acne at some time between the ages of 12-25
years. Up to 20% of women develop mild acne. It is
also found in some newborns.
The sebaceous glands lie just beneath the skin’s
surface. They produce an oil called sebum, the skin’s
natural moisturizer. These glands and the hair follicles
within which they are found are called sebaceous
follicles. These follicles open onto the skin through
pores. At puberty, increased levels of androgens
(male hormones) cause the glands to produce too
much sebum. When excess sebum combines with
dead, sticky skin cells, a hard plug, or comedo, forms
that blocks the pore. Mild noninflammatory acne consists of the two types of comedones, whiteheads and
blackheads.
Moderate and severe inflammatory types of acne
result after the plugged follicle is invaded by
Propionibacterium acnes, a bacteria that normally
lives on the skin. A pimple forms when the damaged
follicle weakens and bursts open, releasing sebum,
bacteria, and skin and white blood cells into the surrounding tissues. Inflamed pimples near the skin’s surface are called papules; when deeper, they are called
pustules. The most severe type of acne consists of cysts
(closed sacs) and nodules (hard swellings). Scarring
occurs when new skin cells are laid down to replace
damaged cells.
The most common sites of acne are the face, chest,
shoulders, and back since these are the parts of the
body where the most sebaceous follicles are found.

I Acne

Causes and symptoms
The exact cause of acne is unknown. Several risk
factors have been identified:


Age. Due to the hormonal changes they experience,
teenagers are more likely to develop acne.



Gender. Boys have more severe acne and develop it
more often than girls.



Disease. Hormonal disorders can complicate acne in
girls.



Heredity. Individuals with a family history of acne
have greater susceptibility to the disease.



Hormonal changes. Acne can flare up before menstruation, during pregnancy, and menopause.

Definition
Acne is a common skin disease characterized by
pimples on the face, chest, and back. It occurs when
the pores of the skin become clogged with oil, dead
skin cells, and bacteria.



Diet. No foods cause acne, but certain foods may
cause flare-ups.



Drugs. Acne can be a side effect of drugs including
tranquilizers, antidepressants, antibiotics, oral contraceptives, and anabolic steroids.



Personal hygiene. Abrasive soaps, hard scrubbing, or
picking at pimples will make them worse.



Cosmetics. Oil-based makeup and hair sprays worsen acne.



Environment. Exposure to oils and greases, polluted
air, and sweating in hot weather aggravate acne.



Stress. Emotional stress may contribute to acne.

Acne is usually not conspicuous, although inflamed lesions may cause pain, tenderness, itching, or
swelling. The most troubling aspects of these lesions
are the negative cosmetic effects and potential for
26

scarring. Some people, especially teenagers, become
emotionally upset about their condition, and have
problems forming relationships or keeping jobs.

Diagnosis
Acne patients are often treated by family doctors.
Complicated cases are referred to a dermatologist, a
skin disease specialist, or an endocrinologist, a specialist who treats diseases of the body’s endocrine (hormones and glands) system.
Acne has a characteristic appearance and is not
difficult to diagnose. The doctor takes a complete
medical history, including questions about skin care,
diet, factors causing flare-ups, medication use, and
prior treatment. Physical examination includes the
face, upper neck, chest, shoulders, back, and other
affected areas. Under good lighting, the doctor determines what types and how many blemishes are present, whether they are inflamed, whether they are deep
or superficial, and whether there is scarring or skin
discoloration.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Laboratory tests are not done unless the patient
appears to have a hormonal disorder or other medical
problem. In this case, blood analyses or other tests
may be ordered. Most insurance plans cover the
costs of diagnosing and treating acne.

Treatment
Acne treatment consists of reducing sebum production, removing dead skin cells, and killing bacteria
with topical drugs and oral medications. Treatment
choice depends upon whether the acne is mild, moderate, or severe.
Drugs
TOPICAL DRUGS. Treatment for mild noninflammatory acne consists of reducing the formation of new
comedones with topical tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide,
adapalene, or salicylic acid. Tretinoin is especially
effective because it increases turnover (death and
replacement) of skin cells. When complicated by
inflammation, topical antibiotics may be added to the
treatment regimen. Improvement is usually seen in
two to four weeks.

Topical medications are available as cream, gel,
lotion, or pad preparations of varying strengths.
They include antibiotics (agents that kill bacteria),
such as erythromycin, clindamycin (Cleocin-T), and
meclocycline (Meclan); comedolytics (agents that
loosen hard plugs and open pores) such as the vitamin
A acid tretinoin (Retin-A), salicylic acid, adapalene
(Differin), resorcinol, and sulfur. Drugs that act as
both comedolytics and antibiotics, such as benzoyl
peroxide, azelaic acid (Azelex), or benzoyl peroxide
plus erythromycin (Benzamycin), are also used.
These drugs may be used for months to years to
achieve disease control.
After washing with mild soap, the drugs are
applied alone or in combination, once or twice a day
over the entire affected area of skin. Possible side
effects include mild redness, peeling, irritation, dryness, and an increased sensitivity to sunlight that
requires use of a sunscreen.
ORAL DRUGS. Oral antibiotics are taken daily for
two to four months. The drugs used include tetracycline,

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

erythromycin, minocycline (Minocin), doxycycline,
clindamycin (Cleocin), and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Septra). Possible side effects include
allergic reactions, stomach upset, vaginal yeast infections, dizziness, and tooth discoloration.
The goal of treating moderate acne is to decrease
inflammation and prevent new comedone formation.
One effective treatment is topical tretinoin along with
a topical or oral antibiotic. A combination of topical
benzoyl peroxide and erythromycin is also very effective. Improvement is normally seen within four to six
weeks, but treatment is maintained for at least two to
four months.
A drug reserved for the treatment of severe
acne, oral isotretinoin (Accutane), reduces sebum
production and cell stickiness. It is the treatment
of choice for severe acne with cysts and nodules,
and is used with or without topical or oral antibiotics. Taken for four to five months, it provides longterm disease control in up to 60% of patients. If the
acne reappears, another course of isotretinoin may
be needed by about 20% of patients, while another
20% may do well with topical drugs or oral antibiotics. Side effects include temporary worsening of
the acne, dry skin, nosebleeds, vision disorders, and
elevated liver enzymes, blood fats and cholesterol.
This drug must not be taken during pregnancy since
it causes birth defects.
Anti-androgens, drugs that inhibit androgen production, are used to treat women who are unresponsive to other therapies. Certain types of oral
contraceptives (for example, Ortho-Tri-Cyclen) and
female sex hormones (estrogens) reduce hormone
activity in the ovaries. Other drugs, for example, spironolactone and corticosteroids, reduce hormone
activity in the adrenal glands. Improvement may
take up to four months.
Oral corticosteroids, or anti-inflammatory drugs,
are the treatment of choice for an extremely severe,
but rare type of destructive inflammatory acne called
acne fulminans, found mostly in adolescent males.
Acne conglobata, a more common form of severe
inflammation, is characterized by numerous, deep,
inflammatory nodules that heal with scarring. It is
treated with oral isotretinoin and corticosteroids.
Other treatments
Several surgical or medical treatments are available to alleviate acne or the resulting scars:


Comedone extraction. The comedo is removed from
the pore with a special tool.
27

Acne

In teenagers, acne is often found on the forehead,
nose, and chin. As people get older, acne tends to
appear towards the outer part of the face. Adult
women may have acne on their chins and around
their mouths. The elderly may develop whiteheads
and blackheads on the upper cheeks and skin around
the eyes.

Acoustic neuroma



Chemical peels. Glycolic acid is applied to peel off
the top layer of skin to reduce scarring.



unless told otherwise, give dry pimples a limited
amount of sun exposure



Dermabrasion. The affected skin is frozen with a
chemical spray, and removed by brushing or planing.



do not pick or squeeze blemishes



reduce stress



Punch grafting. Deep scars are excised and the area
repaired with small skin grafts.



Intralesional injection. Corticosteroids are injected
directly into inflamed pimples.



Collagen injection. Shallow scars are elevated by
collagen (protein) injections.

Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for acne focus on proper
cleansing to keep the skin oil-free; eating a wellbalanced diet high in fiber, zinc, and raw foods; and
avoiding alcohol, dairy products, smoking, caffeine,
sugar, processed foods, and foods high in iodine,
such as salt. Supplementation with herbs such as
burdock root (Arctium lappa), red clover (Trifolium
pratense), and milk thistle (Silybum marianum), and
with nutrients such as essential fatty acids, vitamin B
complex, zinc, vitamin A, and chromium is also
recommended. Chinese herbal remedies used for
acne include cnidium seed (Cnidium monnieri) and
honeysuckle flower (Lonicera japonica). Wholistic
physicians or nutritionists can recommend the proper
amounts of these herbs.

Prognosis
Acne is not curable, although long-term control is
achieved in up to 60% of patients treated with isotretinoin. It can be controlled by proper treatment, with
improvement taking two or more months. Acne tends
to reappear when treatment stops, but spontaneously
improves over time. Inflammatory acne may leave
scars that require further treatment.

Prevention
There are no sure ways to prevent acne, but the
following steps may be taken to minimize flare-ups:


gentle washing of affected areas once or twice every
day



avoid abrasive cleansers



use noncomedogenic makeup and moisturizers



shampoo often and wear hair off face



eat a well-balanced diet, avoiding foods that trigger
flare-ups

I Acoustic neuroma
Definition
An acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor involving
cells of the myelin sheath that surrounds the vestibulocochlear nerve (eighth cranial nerve).

Description
The vestibulocochlear nerve extends from the
inner ear to the brain and is made up of a vestibular
branch, often called the vestibular nerve, and a
cochlear branch, called the cochlear nerve. The vestibular and cochlear nerves lie next to one another. They
also run along side other cranial nerves. People possess
two of each type of vestibulocochlear nerve, one that
extends from the left ear and one that extends from the
right ear.
The vestibular nerve transmits information concerning balance from the inner ear to the brain and the
cochlear nerve transmits information about hearing.
The vestibular nerve, like many nerves, is surrounded
by a cover called a myelin sheath. A tumor, called
a schwannoma, can sometimes develop from the cells
of the myelin sheath. A tumor is an abnormal growth
of tissue that results from the uncontrolled growth of
cells. Acoustic neuromas are often called vestibular
schwannomas because they are tumors that arise
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

An acoustic neuroma can arise from the left
vestibular nerve or the right vestibular nerve. A unilateral tumor is a tumor arising from one nerve and
a bilateral tumor arises from both vestibular nerves.
Unilateral acoustic neuromas usually occur spontaneously (by chance). Bilateral acoustic neuromas
occur as part of a hereditary condition called
Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2). A person with
NF2 has inherited a predisposition for developing acoustic neuromas and other tumors of the
nerve cells.
Acoustic neuromas usually grow slowly and
can take years to develop. Some acoustic neuromas
remain so small that they do not cause any symptoms. As the acoustic neuroma grows it can interfere with the functioning of the vestibular nerve
and can cause vertigo and balance difficulties. If
the acoustic nerve grows large enough to press
against the cochlear nerve, then hearing loss and
a ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear will usually
occur. If untreated and the acoustic neuroma continues to grow it can press against other nerves in
the region and cause other symptoms. This tumor
can be life threatening if it becomes large enough
to press against and interfere with the functioning
of the brain.

KEY TERMS
Benign tumor—A localized overgrowth of cells
that does not spread to other parts of the body.
Chromosome—A microscopic structure, made of a
complex of proteins and DNA, that is found within
each cell of the body.
Computed tomography (CT)—An examination
that uses a computer to compile and analyze the
images produced by x rays projected at a particular
part of the body.
Cranial nerves—The set of twelve nerves found on
each side of the head and neck that control the
sensory and muscle functions of a number of organs
such as the eyes, nose, tongue face and throat.
DNA testing—Testing for a change or changes in a
gene or genes.
Gene— A building block of inheritance, made up
of a compound called DNA (deoxyribonucleic
acid) and containing the instructions for the production of a particular protein. Each gene is found
on a specific location on a chromosome.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)—A test which
uses an external magnetic field instead of x rays to
visualize different tissues of the body.
Myelin sheath—The cover that surrounds many
nerve cells and helps to increase the speed by
which information travels along the nerve.
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2)—A hereditary
condition associated with an increased risk of bilateral acoustic neuromas, other nerve cell tumors
and cataracts.
Protein— A substance produced by a gene that is
involved in creating the traits of the human body
such as hair and eye color or is involved in controlling the basic functions of the human body.

An acoustic neuroma is caused by a change or
absence of both of the NF2 tumor suppressor genes
in a nerve cell. Every person possesses a pair of NF2
genes in every cell of their body including their nerve
cells. One NF2 gene is inherited from the egg cell of the
mother and one NF2 gene is inherited from the sperm
cell of the father. The NF2 gene is responsible for
helping to prevent the formation of tumors in the
nerve cells. In particular the NF2 gene helps to prevent
acoustic neuromas.

Schwannoma—A tumor derived from the cells of
the myelin sheath that surrounds many nerve cells.
Tinnitus—A ringing sound or other noise in the ear.

Only one unchanged and functioning NF2 gene
is necessary to prevent the formation of an acoustic
neuroma. If both NF2 genes become changed or
missing in one of the myelin sheath cells of the

vestibular nerve then an acoustic neuroma will usually
develop. Most unilateral acoustic neuromas result
when the NF2 genes become spontaneously changed
or missing. Someone with a unilateral acoustic

Acoustic neuroma

from the myelin sheath that surrounds the vestibular
nerve. Acoustic neuromas are considered benign
(non-cancerous) tumors since they do not spread
to other parts of the body. They can occur anywhere along the vestibular nerve but are most likely
to occur where the vestibulocochlear nerve passes
through the tiny bony canal that connects the brain
and the inner ear.

Acoustic neuroma

neuroma that has developed spontaneously is not at
increased risk for having children with an acoustic
neuroma. Some unilateral acoustic neuromas result
from the hereditary condition NF2. It is also possible
that some unilateral acoustic neuromas may be caused
by changes in other genes responsible for preventing
the formation of tumors.
Bilateral acoustic neuromas result when someone is affected with the hereditary condition NF2.
A person with NF2 is typically born with one
unchanged and one changed or missing NF2 gene
in every cell of their body. Sometimes they inherit
this change from their mother or father. Sometimes
the change occurs spontaneously when the egg and
sperm come together to form the first cell of the
baby. The children of a person with NF2 have a
50% chance of inheriting the changed or missing
NF2 gene.
A person with NF2 will develop an acoustic neuroma if the remaining unchanged NF2 gene becomes
spontaneously changed or missing in one of the myelin
sheath cells of their vestibular nerve. People with NF2
often develop acoustic neuromas at a younger age.
The mean age of onset of acoustic neuroma in NF2
is 31 years of age versus 50 years of age for sporadic
acoustic neuromas. Not all people with NF2, however,
develop acoustic neuromas. People with NF2 are at
increased risk for developing cataracts and tumors in
other nerve cells.
Most people with a unilateral acoustic neuroma
are not affected with NF2. Some people with NF2,
however, only develop a tumor in one of the vestibulocochlear nerves. Others may initially be diagnosed
with a unilateral tumor but may develop a tumor in the
other nerve a number of years later. NF2 should be
considered in someone under the age of 40 who has a
unilateral acoustic neuroma. Someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma and other family members
diagnosed with NF2 probably is affected with NF2.
Someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma and
other symptoms of NF2 such as cataracts and other
tumors may also be affected with NF2. On the other
hand, someone over the age of 50 with a unilateral
acoustic neuroma, no other tumors and no family
history of NF2 is very unlikely to be affected
with NF2.
Recent studies in Europe have suggested a possible connection between the widespread use of mobile
phones and an increased risk of developing acoustic
neuromas. Some observers, however, question
whether mobile phones have been in use long enough
to be an identifiable risk factor.
30

Symptoms
Small acoustic neuromas usually only interfere
with the functioning of the vestibulocochlear nerve.
The most common first symptom of an acoustic neuroma is hearing loss, which is often accompanied by a
ringing sound (tinnitis). People with acoustic neuromas sometimes report difficulties in using the phone
and difficulties in perceiving the tone of a musical
instrument or sound even when their hearing appears
to be otherwise normal. In most cases the hearing loss
is initially subtle and worsens gradually over time
until deafness occurs in the affected ear. In approximately 10% of cases the hearing loss is sudden and
severe.
Acoustic neuromas can also affect the functioning of the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear
nerve and van cause vertigo and dysequilibrium.
Twenty percent of small tumors are associated with
periodic vertigo, which is characterized by dizziness
or a whirling sensation. Larger acoustic neuromas are
less likely to cause vertigo but more likely to cause
dysequilibrium. Dysequilibrium, which is characterized by minor clumsiness and a general feeling of
instability, occurs in nearly 50% of people with an
acoustic neuroma.
As the tumor grows larger it can press on the
surrounding cranial nerves. Compression of the fifth
cranial nerve can result in facial pain and or numbness. Compression of the seventh cranial nerve can
cause spasms, weakness or paralysis of the facial
muscles. Double vision is a rare symptom but can
result when the 6th cranial nerve is affected.
Swallowing and/or speaking difficulties can occur if
the tumor presses against the 9th, 10th, or 12th cranial nerves.
If left untreated, the tumor can become large
enough to press against and affect the functioning
of the brain stem. The brain stem is the stalk like
portion of the brain that joins the spinal cord to the
cerebrum, the thinking and reasoning part of the
brain. Different parts of the brainstem have different
functions such as the control of breathing and muscle
coordination. Large tumors that impact the brain
stem can result in headaches, walking difficulties
(gait ataxia) and involuntary shaking movements of
the muscles (tremors). In rare cases when an acoustic
neuroma remains undiagnosed and untreated it can
cause nausea, vomiting, lethargy and eventually
coma, respiratory difficulties and death. In the vast
majority of cases, however, the tumor is discovered
and treated long before it is large enough to cause
such serious manifestations.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Anyone with symptoms of hearing loss should
undergo hearing evaluations. Pure tone and speech
audiometry are two screening tests that are often
used to evaluate hearing. Pure tone audiometry
tests to see how well someone can hear tones of
different volume and pitch and speech audiometry
tests to see how well someone can hear and recognize speech. An acoustic neuroma is suspected in
someone with unilateral hearing loss or hearing loss
that is less severe in one ear than the other ear
(asymmetrical).
Sometimes an auditory brainstem response (ABR,
BAER) test is performed to help establish whether
someone is likely to have an acoustic neuroma.
During the ABR examination, a harmless electrical
impulse is passed from the inner ear to the brainstem.
An acoustic neuroma can interfere with the passage of
this electrical impulse and this interference can, sometimes be identified through the ABR evaluation.
A normal ABR examination does not rule out the
possibility of an acoustic neuroma. An abnormal
ABR examination increases the likelihood that an
acoustic neuroma is present but other tests are necessary to confirm the presence of a tumor.
If an acoustic neuroma is strongly suspected then
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually performed. The MRI is a very accurate evaluation that
is able to detect nearly 100% of acoustic neuromas.
Computerized tomography (CT scan, CAT scan)is
unable to identify smaller tumors; but it can be used
when an acoustic neuroma is suspected and an MRI
evaluation cannot be performed.
Once an acoustic neuroma is diagnosed, an evaluation by genetic specialists such as a geneticist and
genetic counselor may be recommended. The purpose
of this evaluation is to obtain a detailed family history
and check for signs of NF2. If NF2 is strongly suspected then DNA testing may be recommended. DNA
testing involves checking the blood cells obtained from
a routine blood draw for the common gene changes
associated with NF2.

Treatment
The three treatment options for acoustic neuroma
are surgery, radiation, and observation. The physician
and patient should discuss the pros and cons of
the different options prior to making a decision
about treatment. The patient’s, physical health, age,
symptoms, tumor size, and tumor location should be
considered.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Microsurgery
The surgical removal of the tumor or tumors is the
most common treatment for acoustic neuroma. In
most cases the entire tumor is removed during the
surgery. If the tumor is large and causing significant
symptoms, yet there is a need to preserve hearing
in that ear, then only part of the tumor may be
removed. During the procedure the tumor is removed
under microscopic guidance and general anesthetic.
Monitoring of the neighboring cranial nerves is done
during the procedure so that damage to these nerves
can be prevented. If preservation of hearing is a possibility, then monitoring of hearing will also take place
during the surgery.
Most people stay in the hospital four to seven days
following the surgery. Total recovery usually takes
four to six weeks. Most people experience fatigue and
head discomfort following the surgery. Problems with
balance and head and neck stiffness are also common.
The mortality rate of this type of surgery is less than
2% at most major centers. Approximately 20% of
patients experience some degree of post-surgical complications. In most cases these complications can be
managed successfully and do not result in long term
medical problems. Surgery brings with it a risk of
stroke, damage to the brain stem, infection, leakage
of spinal fluid and damage to the cranial nerves.
Hearing loss and/or tinnitis often result from the surgery. A follow-up MRI is recommended one to five
years following the surgery because of possible
regrowth of the tumor.
Stereotactic radiation therapy
During stereotactic radiation therapy, also called
radiosurgery or radiotherapy, many small beams of
radiation are aimed directly at the acoustic neuroma.
The radiation is administered in a single large dose,
under local anesthetic and is performed on an outpatient basis. This results in a high dose of radiation
to the tumor but little radiation exposure to the
surrounding area. This treatment approach is limited
to small or medium tumors. The goal of the surgery is
to cause tumor shrinkage or at least limit the growth
of the tumor. The long-term efficacy and risks of this
treatment approach are not known; however, as of
the early 2000s, more and more patients diagnosed
with acoustic neuromas are choosing this form of
therapy. Periodic MRI monitoring throughout the
life of the patient is therefore recommended.
Radiation therapy can cause hearing loss which
can sometimes occurs even years later. Radiation therapy can also cause damage to neighboring cranial

nerves, which can result in symptoms such as numbness, pain or paralysis of the facial muscles. In many
cases these symptoms are temporary. Radiation treatment can also induce the formation of other benign or
malignant schwannomas. This type of treatment may
therefore be contraindicated in the treatment of acoustic neuromas in those with NF2 who are predisposed
to developing schwannomas and other tumors.
Observation
Acoustic neuromas are usually slow growing and
in some cases they will stop growing and even become
smaller or disappear entirely. It may therefore be
appropriate in some cases to hold off on treatment
and to periodically monitor the tumor through MRI
evaluations. Long-term observation may be appropriate for example in an elderly person with a small
acoustic neuroma and few symptoms. Periodic observation may also be indicated for someone with a small
and asymptomatic acoustic neuroma that was
detected through an evaluation for another medical
problem. Observation may also be suggested for someone with an acoustic neuroma in the only hearing ear
or in the ear that has better hearing. The danger of an
observational approach is that as the tumor grows
larger it can become more difficult to treat.

Prognosis
The prognosis for someone with a unilateral
acoustic neuroma is usually quite good provided the
tumor is diagnosed early and appropriate treatment is
instituted. Long term-hearing loss and tinnitis in the
affected ear are common, even if appropriate treatment is provided. Many patients also experience
facial weakness, balance problems, and headaches.
Regrowth of the tumor is also a possibility following
surgery or radiation therapy and repeat treatment may
be necessary. The prognosis can be poorer for those
with NF2 who have an increased risk of bilateral
acoustic neuromas and other tumors.

I Acrocyanosis
Definition
Acrocyanosis is a decrease in the amount of
oxygen delivered to the extremities. The hands and
feet turn blue because of the lack of oxygen.
Decreased blood supply to the affected areas is caused
by constriction or spasm of small blood vessels.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Acrocyanosis is a painless disorder caused by constriction or narrowing of small blood vessels in the
skin of affected patients. The spasm of the blood
vessels decreases the amount of blood that passes
through them, resulting in less blood being delivered
to the hands and feet. The hands may be the main area
affected. The affected areas turn blue and become cold
and sweaty. Localized swelling may also occur.
Emotion and cold temperatures can worsen the symptoms, while warmth can decrease symptoms. The disease is seen mainly in women and the effect of the
disorder is mainly cosmetic. People with the disease
tend to be uncomfortable, with sweaty, cold, bluish
colored hands and feet.

KEY TERMS
Sympathetic nerve—A nerve of the autonomic nervous system that regulates involuntary and automatic reactions, especially to stress.

Prognosis
Acrocyanosis is a benign and persistent disease.
The main concern of patients is cosmetic. Left
untreated, the disease does not worsen.
Resources
BOOKS

Causes and symptoms
The sympathetic nerves cause constriction or
spasms in the peripheral blood vessels that supply
blood to the extremities. The spasms are a contraction
of the muscles in the walls of the blood vessels. The
contraction decreases the internal diameter of the
blood vessels, thereby decreasing the amount of
blood flow through the affected area. The spasms
occur on a persistent basis, resulting in long term
reduction of blood supply to the hands and feet.
Sufficient blood still passes through the blood vessels
so that the tissue in the affected areas does not starve
for oxygen or die. Mainly, blood vessels near the surface of the skin are affected.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made by observation of the main
clinical symptoms, including persistently blue and
sweaty hands and/or feet and a lack of pain. Cooling
the hands increases the blueness, while warming the
hands decreases the blue color. The acrocyanosis
patient’s pulse is normal, which rules out obstructive
diseases. Raynaud’s disease differs from acrocyanosis
in that it causes white and red skin coloration phases,
not just bluish discoloration.

Treatment
Acrocyanosis usually isn’t treated. Drugs that
block the uptake of calcium (calcium channel blockers)
and alpha-one antagonists reduce the symptoms in
most cases. Drugs that dilate blood vessels are
only effective some of the time. Sweating from the
affected areas can be profuse and require treatment.
Surgery to cut the sympathetic nerves is performed
rarely.

I Acromegaly and gigantism
Definition
Acromegaly is a disorder in which the abnormal release of a particular chemical from the pituitary gland in the brain causes increased growth in
bone and soft tissue, as well as a variety of other
disturbances throughout the body. This chemical
released from the pituitary gland is called growth
hormone (GH). The body’s ability to process and
use nutrients like fats and sugars is also altered. In
children whose bony growth plates have not closed,
the chemical changes of acromegaly result in
exceptional growth of long bones. This variant is
called gigantism, with the additional bone growth
causing unusual height. When the abnormality occurs
after bone growth stops, the disorder is called
acromegaly.

Description
Acromegaly is a relatively rare disorder, occurring
in approximately 50 out of every one million people
(50/1,000,000). Both men and women are affected.
Because the symptoms of acromegaly occur so gradually, diagnosis is often delayed. The majority of patients
are not identified until they are middle aged.

Acromegaly and gigantism

Description

Acromegaly and gigantism

KEY TERMS
Adenoma—A type of noncancerous (benign) tumor
that often involves the overgrowth of certain cells
found in glands.
Gland—A collection of cells that releases certain
chemicals, or hormones, that are important to the
functioning of other organs or body systems.
Hormone—A chemical produced in one part of the
body that travels to another part of the body in order
to exert an effect.
Hypothalamus—A structure within the brain
responsible for a large number of normal functions
throughout the body, including regulating sleep,
temperature, eating, and sexual development. The
hypothalamus also regulates the functions of the
pituitary gland by directing the pituitary to stop or
start production of its hormones.
Pituitary—A gland located at the base of the brain
that produces a number of hormones, including
those that regulate growth and reproductive functions. Overproduction of the pituitary hormone
called growth hormone (GH) is responsible for the
condition known as acromegaly.

Causes and symptoms
The pituitary is a small gland located at the base of
the brain. A gland is a collection of cells that releases
certain chemicals, or hormones, which are important
to the functioning of other organs or body systems.
The pituitary hormones travel throughout the body
and are involved in a large number of activities,
including the regulation of growth and reproductive
functions. The cause of acromegaly can be traced to
the pituitary’s production of GH.
Under normal conditions, the pituitary receives
input from another brain structure, the hypothalamus,
located at the base of the brain. This input from the
hypothalamus regulates the pituitary’s release of hormones. For example, the hypothalamus produces
growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which
directs the pituitary to release GH. Input from the
hypothalamus should also direct the pituitary to stop
releasing hormones.
34

In acromegaly, the pituitary continues to release
GH and ignores signals from the hypothalamus. In the
liver, GH causes production of a hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is responsible
for growth throughout the body. When the pituitary
refuses to stop producing GH, the levels of IGF-1 also
reach abnormal peaks. Bones, soft tissue, and organs
throughout the body begin to enlarge, and the body
changes its ability to process and use nutrients like
sugars and fats.
In acromegaly, an individual’s hands and feet begin
to grow, becoming thick and doughy. The jaw line, nose,
and forehead also grow, and facial features are described
as ‘‘coarsening’’. The tongue grows larger, and because
the jaw is larger, the teeth become more widely spaced.
Due to swelling within the structures of the throat
and sinuses, the voice becomes deeper and sounds
more hollow, and patients may develop loud snoring.
Various hormonal changes cause symptoms such as:


heavy sweating



oily skin



increased coarse body hair



improper processing of sugars in the diet (and sometimes actual diabetes)
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

high blood pressure



increased calcium in the urine (sometimes leading to
kidney stones)



increased risk of gallstones; and



swelling of the thyroid gland

People with acromegaly have more skin tags, or
outgrowths of tissue, than normal. This increase in
skin tags is also associated with the development of
growths, called polyps, within the large intestine that
may eventually become cancerous. Patients with acromegaly often suffer from headaches and arthritis. The
various swellings and enlargements throughout the
body may press on nerves, causing sensations of local
tingling or burning, and sometimes result in muscle
weakness.
The most common cause of this disorder (in 90%
of patients) is the development of a noncancerous
tumor within the pituitary, called a pituitary adenoma.
These tumors are the source of the abnormal release of
GH. As these tumors grow, they may press on nearby
structures within the brain, causing headaches and
changes in vision. As the adenoma grows, it may disrupt other pituitary tissue, interfering with the release
of other hormones. These disruptions may be responsible for changes in the menstrual cycle of women,
decreases in the sexual drive in men and women, and
the abnormal production of breast milk in women.
In rare cases, acromegaly is caused by the abnormal
production of GHRH, which leads to the increased
production of GH. Certain tumors in the pancreas,
lungs, adrenal glands, thyroid, and intestine produce
GHRH, which in turn triggers production of an
abnormal quantity of GH.

Diagnosis
Because acromegaly produces slow changes over
time, diagnosis is often significantly delayed. In fact,
the characteristic coarsening of the facial features is
often not recognized by family members, friends, or
long-time family physicians. Often, the diagnosis is
suspected by a new physician who sees the patient for
the first time and is struck by the patient’s characteristic facial appearance. Comparing old photographs
from a number of different time periods will often
increase suspicion of the disease.
Because the quantity of GH produced varies
widely under normal conditions, demonstrating high
levels of GH in the blood is not sufficient to merit a
diagnosis of acromegaly. Instead, laboratory tests measuring an increase of IGF-1 (3-10 times above the
normal level) are useful. These results, however, must

be carefully interpreted because normal laboratory
values for IGF-1 vary when the patient is pregnant,
undergoing puberty, elderly, or severely malnourished.
Normal patients will show a decrease in GH production when given a large dose of sugar (glucose). Patients
with acromegaly will not show this decrease, and will
often show an increase in GH production. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is useful for viewing the
pituitary, and for identifying and locating an adenoma.
When no adenoma can be located, the search for a
GHRH-producing tumor in another location begins.

Treatment
The first step in treatment of acromegaly is
removal of all or part of the pituitary adenoma.
Removal requires surgery, usually performed by
entering the skull through the nose. While this surgery
can cause rapid improvement of many acromegaly
symptoms, most patients will also require additional
treatment with medication. Bromocriptine (Parlodel)
is a medication that can be taken by mouth, while
octreotide (Sandostatin) must be injected every eight
hours. Both of these medications are helpful in reducing GH production, but must often be taken for life
and produce their own unique side effects. Some
patients who cannot undergo surgery are treated
with radiation therapy to the pituitary in an attempt
to shrink the adenoma. Radiating the pituitary may
take up to 10 years, however, and may also injure/
destroy other normal parts of the pituitary.

Prognosis
Without treatment, patients with acromegaly will
most likely die early because of the disease’s effects on

I Actinomycosis
Definition
Actinomycosis is an infection primarily caused by
the bacterium Actinomyces israelii. Infection most
often occurs in the face and neck region and is characterized by the presence of a slowly enlarging, hard,
red lump.

Description
Actinomycosis is a relatively rare infection
occurring in one out of 300,000(1/300,000) people
per year. It is characterized by the presence of a
lump or mass that often forms, draining sinus tracts
to the skin surface. Fifty percent of actinomycosis
cases are of the head and neck region (also called
‘‘lumpy jaw’’ and ‘‘cervicofacial actinomycosis’’),
15% are in the chest, 20% are in the abdomen, and
the rest are in the pelvis, heart, and brain. Men are
three times more likely to develop actinomycosis than
women.

36

KEY TERMS

Actinomycosis is usually caused by the bacterium
Actinomyces israelii. This bacterium is normally present in the mouth but can cause disease if it enters
tissues following an injury. Actinomyces israelii is an
anaerobic bacterium which means it dislikes oxygen
but grows very well in deep tissues where oxygen levels
are low. Tooth extraction, tooth disease, root canal
treatment, jaw surgery, or poor dental hygiene can
allow Actinomyces israelii to cause an infection in the
head and neck region.
The main symptom of cervicofacial actinomycosis
is the presence of a hard lump on the face or neck. The
lump may or may not be red. Fever occurs in some
cases.

Diagnosis
Cervicofacial actinomycosis can be diagnosed by
a family doctor or dentist and the patient may be
referred to an oral surgeon or infectious disease
specialist. The diagnosis of actinomycosis is based
upon several things. The presence of a red lump with
draining sinuses on the head or neck is strongly
suggestive of cervicofacial actinomycosis. A recent
history of tooth extraction or signs of tooth decay or
poor dental hygiene aid in the diagnosis. Microscopic
examination of the fluid draining from the sinuses
shows the characteristic ‘‘sulfur Granules’’ (small
yellow colored material in the fluid) produced by
Actinomyces israelii. A biopsy may be performed to
remove a sample of the infected tissue. This procedure
can be performed under local anesthesia in the doctor’s
office. Occasionally the bacteria can be cultured
from the sinus tract fluid or from samples of the
infected tissue.
Actinomycosis in the lungs, abdomen, pelvis, or
brain can be very hard to diagnose since the symptoms
often mimic those of other diseases. Actinomycosis

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment
Actinomycosis is difficult to treat because of its
dense tissue location. Surgery is often required to
drain the lesion and/or to remove the site of infection. To kill the bacteria, standard therapy has
included large doses of penicillin given through a
vein daily for two to six weeks followed by six to
twelve months of penicillin taken by mouth.
Tetracycline, clindamycin, or erythromycin may be
used instead of penicillin. The antibiotic therapy
must be completed to ensure that the infection
does not return. However, a report in 2004 on
several cases of actinomycosis said that therapy
depends on the individual case and that many
patients today will be diagnosed in earlier stages
of the disease. Sometimes, shorter courses of antibiotic treatment are effective, with close diagnostic
x-ray monitoring. Hyperbaric oxygen (oxygen
under high pressure) therapy in combination with
the antibiotic therapy has been successful.

Prognosis
Complete recovery is achieved following treatment. If left untreated, the infection may cause localized bone destruction.

I Acupressure
Definition
Acupressure is a form of touch therapy that
utilizes the principles of acupuncture and Chinese
medicine. In acupressure, the same points on the
body are used as in acupuncture, but are stimulated
with finger pressure instead of with the insertion of
needles. Acupressure is used to relieve a variety of
symptoms and pain.

Purpose
Acupressure massage performed by a therapist
can be very effective both as prevention and as a
treatment for many health conditions, including
headaches, general aches and pains, colds and flu,
arthritis, allergies, asthma, nervous tension, menstrual cramps, sinus problems, sprains, tennis elbow,
and toothaches, among others. Unlike acupuncture
which requires a visit to a professional, acupressure
can be performed by a layperson. Acupressure techniques are fairly easy to learn, and have been used to
provide quick, cost-free, and effective relief from
many symptoms. Acupressure points can also be
stimulated to increase energy and feelings of wellbeing, reduce stress, stimulate the immune system,
and alleviate sexual dysfunction.

One of the oldest text of Chinese medicine is the
Huang Di, The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal
Medicine, which may be at least 2,000 years old.
Chinese medicine has developed acupuncture, acupressure, herbal remedies, diet, exercise, lifestyle changes,
and other remedies as part of its healing methods.
Nearly all of the forms of Oriental medicine that are
used in the West today, including acupuncture, acupressure, shiatsu, and Chinese herbal medicine, have
their roots in Chinese medicine. One legend has it that
acupuncture and acupressure evolved as early Chinese
healers studied the puncture wounds of Chinese warriors, noting that certain points on the body created
interesting results when stimulated. The oldest known
text specifically on acupuncture points, the Systematic
Classic of Acupuncture, dates back to 282 A.D.
Acupressure is the non-invasive form of acupuncture,
as Chinese physicians determined that stimulating
points on the body with massage and pressure could
be effective for treating certain problems.

Outside of Asian-American communities, Chinese
medicine remained virtually unknown in the United
States until the 1970s, when Richard Nixon became
the first U.S. president to visit China. On Nixon’s trip,
journalists were amazed to observe major operations
being performed on patients without the use of anesthetics. Instead, wide-awake patients were being operated on, with only acupuncture needles inserted into
them to control pain. At that time, a famous columnist
for the New York Times, James Reston, had to
undergo surgery and elected to use acupuncture for
anesthesia. Later, he wrote some convincing stories
on its effectiveness. Despite being neglected by
mainstream medicine and the American Medical
Association (AMA), acupuncture and Chinese medicine became a central to alternative medicine practitioners in the United States. Today, there are millions
of patients who attest to its effectiveness, and nearly
9,000 practitioners in all 50 states.
Acupressure is practiced as a treatment by Chinese
medicine practitioners and acupuncturists, as well as
by massage therapists. Most massage schools in
American include acupressure techniques as part of
38

their bodywork programs. Shiatsu massage is very
closely related to acupressure, working with the same
points on the body and the same general principles,
although it was developed over centuries in Japan
rather than in China. Reflexology is a form of bodywork based on acupressure concepts. Jin Shin Do is a
bodywork technique with an increasing number of
practitioners in America that combines acupressure
and shiatsu principles with qigong, Reichian theory,
and meditation.
Acupressure and Chinese medicine
Chinese medicine views the body as a small part
of the universe, subject to laws and principles of
harmony and balance. Chinese medicine does not
make as sharp a destinction as Western medicine
does between mind and body. The Chinese system
believes that emotions and mental states are every
bit as influential on disease as purely physical
mechanisms, and considers factors like work, environment, and relationships as fundamental to a
patient’s health. Chinese medicine also uses very different symbols and ideas to discuss the body and

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Everything in the universe has properties of
yin and yang. Yin is associated with cold, female,
passive, downward, inward, dark, wet. Yang can be
described as hot, male, active, upward, outward, light,
dry, and so on. Nothing is either completely yin or
yang. These two principles always interact and affect
each other, although the body and its organs can
become imbalanced by having either too much or too
little of either.
Chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qi or ki in
Japanese shiatsu) is the fundamental life energy. It is
found in food, air, water, and sunlight, and it travels
through the body in channels called meridians. There
are 12 major meridians in the body that transport chi,
corresponding to the 12 main organs categorized by
Chinese medicine.
Disease is viewed as an imbalance of the organs
and chi in the body. Chinese medicine has developed
intricate systems of how organs are related to physical
and mental symptoms, and it has devised corresponding treatments using the meridian and pressure point
networks that are classified and numbered. The goal

Acupressure

KEY TERMS

Acupressure

of acupressure, and acupuncture, is to stimulate and
unblock the circulation of chi, by activating very specific points, called pressure points or acupoints.
Acupressure seeks to stimulate the points on the chi
meridians that pass close to the skin, as these are
easiest to unblock and manipulate with finger
pressure.
Acupressure can be used as part of a Chinese
physician’s prescription, as a session of massage therapy, or as a self-treatment for common aches and illnesses. A Chinese medicine practitioner examines a
patient very thoroughly, looking at physical, mental
and emotional activity, taking the pulse usually at the
wrists, examining the tongue and complexion, and
observing the patient’s demeanor and attitude, to get
a complete diagnosis of which organs and meridian
points are out of balance. When the imbalance is
located, the physician will recommend specific pressure points for acupuncture or acupressure. If acupressure is recommended, the patient might opt for a series
of treatments from a massage therapist.
In massage therapy, acupressurists will evaluate a
patient’s symptoms and overall health, but a massage
therapist’s diagnostic training isn’t as extensive as a
Chinese physician’s. In a massage therapy treatment, a
person usually lies down on a table or mat, with thin
clothing on. The acupressurist will gently feel and
palpate the abdomen and other parts of the body to
determine energy imbalances. Then, the therapist will
work with different meridians throughout the body,
depending on which organs are imbalanced in the
abdomen. The therapist will use different types of
finger movements and pressure on different acupoints,
depending on whether the chi needs to be increased
or dispersed at different points. The therapist observes
and guides the energy flow through the patient’s body
throughout the session. Sometimes, special herbs
(Artemesia vulgaris or moxa) may be placed on a
point to warm it, a process called moxibustion. A session of acupressure is generally a very pleasant experience, and some people experience great benefit
immediately. For more chronic conditions, several
sessions may be necessary to relieve and improve
conditions.
Acupressure massage usually costs from $30–70
per hour session. A visit to a Chinese medicine physician or acupuncturist can be more expensive, comparable to a visit to an allopathic physician if the
practitioner is an MD. Insurance reimbursement varies widely, and consumers should be aware if their
policies cover alternative treatment, acupuncture, or
massage therapy.

40

Self-treatment
Acupressure is easy to learn, and there are many
good books that illustrate the position of acupoints
and meridians on the body. It is also very versatile, as
it can be done anywhere, and it’s a good form of
treatment for spouses and partners to give to each
other and for parents to perform on children for
minor conditions.
While giving self-treatment or performing acupressure on another, a mental attitude of calmness
and attention is important, as one person’s energy
can be used to help another’s. Loose, thin clothing is
recommended. There are three general techniques for
stimulating a pressure point.


Tonifying is meant to strengthen weak chi, and is
done by pressing the thumb or finger into an acupoint with a firm, steady pressure, holding it for up to
two minutes.



Dispersing is meant to move stagnant or blocked
chi, and the finger or thumb is moved in a circular
motion or slightly in and out of the point for two
minutes.



Calming the chi in a pressure point utilizes the palm
to cover the point and gently stroke the area for
about two minutes.

There are many pressure points that are easily
found and memorized to treat common ailments
from headaches to colds.


For headaches, toothaches, sinus problems, and
pain in the upper body, the ‘‘LI4’’ point is recommended. It is located in the web between the thumb
and index finger, on the back of the hand. Using the
thumb and index finger of the other hand, apply a
pinching pressure until the point is felt, and hold it
for two minutes. Pregnant women should never
press this point.



To calm the nerves and stimulate digestion, find the
‘‘CV12’’ point that is four thumb widths above the
navel in the center of the abdomen. Calm the point
with the palm, using gentle stroking for several
minutes.



To stimulate the immune system, find the ‘‘TH5’’
point on the back of the forearm two thumb widths
above the wrist. Use a dispersing technique, or circular pressure with the thumb or finger, for two
minutes on each arm.



For headaches, sinus congestion, and tension, locate
the ‘‘GB20’’ points at the base of the skull in the
back of the head, just behind the bones in back of

the ears. Disperse these points for two minutes with

which is in the middle of the forehead between the

minutes to clear the mind and to relieve headaches.

Precautions
Acupressure is a safe technique, but it is not meant
to replace professional health care. A physician should
always be consulted when there are doubts about
medical conditions. If a condition is chronic, a professional should be consulted; purely symptomatic treatment can exacerbate chronic conditions. Acupressure
should not be applied to open wounds, or where there
is swelling and inflammation. Areas of scar tissue,
blisters, boils, rashes, or varicose veins should be
avoided. Finally, certain acupressure points should
not be stimulated on people with high or low blood
pressure and on pregnant women.

Research and general acceptance
In general, Chinese medicine has been slow to
gain acceptance in the West, mainly because it rests
on ideas very foreign to the scientific model. For
instance, Western scientists have trouble with the
idea of chi, the invisible energy of the body, and the
idea that pressing on certain points can alleviate
certain conditions seems sometimes too simple for
scientists to believe.
Western scientists, in trying to account for the
action of acupressure, have theorized that chi is actually part of the neuroendocrine system of the body.
Celebrated orthopedic surgeon Robert O. Becker,
who was twice nominated for the Nobel Prize, wrote
a book on the subject called Cross Currents: The
Promise of Electromedicine; The Perils of Electropollution. By using precise electrical measuring
devices, Becker and his colleagues showed that the
body has a complex web of electromagnetic energy,
and that traditional acupressure meridians and points
contained amounts of energy that non-acupressure
points did not.
The mechanisms of acupuncture and acupressure remain difficult to document in terms of the
biochemical processes involved; numerous testimonials are the primary evidence backing up the
effectiveness of acupressure and acupuncture.
However, a body of research is growing that verifies the effectiveness in acupressure and acupuncture techniques in treating many problems and in
controlling pain.

I Acupuncture
Definition
Acupuncture is one of the main forms of treatment in traditional Chinese medicine. It involves the
use of sharp, thin needles that are inserted in the body
at very specific points. This process is believed to
adjust and alter the body’s energy flow into healthier
patterns, and is used to treat a wide variety of illnesses
and health conditions.

Purpose
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends acupuncture as an effective treatment for over
forty medical problems, including allergies, respiratory conditions, gastrointestinal disorders, gynecological problems, nervous conditions, and disorders of
the eyes, nose and throat, and childhood illnesses,
among others. Acupuncture has been used in the
treatment of alcoholism and substance abuse. It is
an effective and low-cost treatment for headaches
and chronic pain, associated with problems like
back injuries and arthritis. It has also been used
to supplement invasive Western treatments like
chemotherapy and surgery. Acupuncture is generally
most effective when used as prevention or before a
health condition becomes acute, but it has been used
to help patients suffering from cancer and AIDS.
Acupuncture is limited in treating conditions or
traumas that require surgery or emergency care
(such as for broken bones).

Description
Origins
The original text of Chinese medicine is the Nei
Ching, The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal
Medicine, which is estimated to be at least 2,500 years
old. Thousands of books since then have been written
on the subject of Chinese healing, and its basic philosophies spread long ago to other Asian civilizations.
Nearly all of the forms of Oriental medicine which are
used in the West today, including acupuncture, shiatsu,
acupressure massage, and macrobiotics, are part of or
have their roots in Chinese medicine. Legend has it that
acupuncture developed when early Chinese physicians
observed unpredicted effects of puncture wounds in
Chinese warriors. The oldest known text on acupuncture, the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture, dates back
to 282 A.D. Although acupuncture is its best known
technique, Chinese medicine traditionally utilizes herbal remedies, dietary therapy, lifestyle changes and
other means to treat patients.
In the early 1900s, only a few Western physicians
who had visited China were fascinated by acupuncture,
42

but outside of Asian-American communities it
remained virtually unknown until the 1970s, when
Richard Nixon became the first U.S. president to
visit China. On Nixon’s trip, journalists were amazed
to observe major operations being performed on
patients without the use of anesthetics. Instead,
wide-awake patients were being operated on with
only acupuncture needles inserted into them to control pain. During that time, a famous columnist for
the New York Times, James Reston, had to undergo
surgery and elected to use acupuncture instead of
pain medication, and he wrote some convincing
stories on its effectiveness.
Today, acupuncture is being practiced in all 50
states by over 9,000 practitioners, with over 4,000
MDs including it in their practices. Acupuncture has
shown notable success in treating many conditions,
and over 15 million Americans have used it as a therapy. Acupuncture, however, remains largely unsupported by the medical establishment. The American
Medical Association has been resistant to researching
it, as it is based on concepts very different from the
Western scientific model.

Basic ideas of Chinese medicine
Chinese medicine views the body as a small part
of the universe, and subject to universal laws and
principles of harmony and balance. Chinese medicine
does not draw a sharp line, as Western medicine does,
between mind and body. The Chinese system believes
that emotions and mental states are every bit as
influential on disease as purely physical mechanisms,
and considers factors like work, environment, lifestyle and relationships as fundamental to the overall
picture of a patient’s health. Chinese medicine also
uses very different symbols and ideas to discuss the
body and health. While Western medicine typically
describes health in terms of measurable physical
processes made up of chemical reactions, the Chinese
use ideas like yin and yang, chi, the organ system, and
43

Acupuncture

the five elements to describe health and the body. To
understand the ideas behind acupuncture, it is worthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms.
YIN AND YANG. According to Chinese philosophy,
the universe and the body can be described by two
separate but complementary principles, that of yin
and yang. For example, in temperature, yin is cold
and yang is hot. In gender, yin is female and yang is
male. In activity, yin is passive and yang is active. In
light, yin is dark and yang is bright; in direction yin is
inward and downward and yang is outward and up,
and so on. Nothing is ever completely yin or yang, but
a combination of the two. These two principles are
always interacting, opposing, and influencing each
other. The goal of Chinese medicine is not to eliminate
either yin or yang, but to allow the two to balance each
other and exist harmoniously together. For instance, if
a person suffers from symptoms of high blood pressure,
the Chinese system would say that the heart organ
might have too much yang, and would recommend
methods either to reduce the yang or to increase the
yin of the heart, depending on the other symptoms and
organs in the body. Thus, acupuncture therapies seek to
either increase or reduce yang, or increase or reduce yin
in particular regions of the body.
CHI. Another fundamental concept of Chinese
medicine is that of chi (pronounced chee, also spelled
qi). Chi is the fundamental life energy of the universe.
It is invisible and is found in the environment in the
air, water, food and sunlight. In the body, it is the
invisible vital force that creates and animates life.
We are all born with inherited amounts of chi, and
we also get acquired chi from the food we eat and the
air we breathe. The level and quality of a person’s chi
also depends on the state of physical, mental and
emotional balance. Chi travels through the body
along channels called meridians.
THE ORGAN SYSTEM. In the Chinese system, there
are twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, stomach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder,
kidney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the ‘‘triple
warmer,’’ which represents the entire torso region.
Each organ has chi energy associated with it, and
each organ interacts with particular emotions on the
mental level. As there are twelve organs, there are
twelve types of chi which can move through the body,
and these move through twelve main channels or meridians. Chinese doctors connect symptoms to organs.
That is, symptoms are caused by yin/yang imbalances
in one or more organs, or by an unhealthy flow of chi
to or from one organ to another. Each organ has a
different profile of symptoms it can manifest.

44

THE FIVE ELEMENTS. Another basis of Chinese theory is that the world and body are made up of five
main elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water.
These elements are all interconnected, and each element either generates or controls another element. For
instance, water controls fire and earth generates metal.
Each organ is associated with one of the five elements.
The Chinese system uses elements and organs to
describe and treat conditions. For instance, the kidney
is associated with water and the heart is associated
with fire, and the two organs are related as water and
fire are related. If the kidney is weak, then there might
be a corresponding fire problem in the heart, so treatment might be made by acupuncture or herbs to cool
the heart system and/or increase energy in the kidney
system.

The Chinese have developed an intricate system of
how organs and elements are related to physical and
mental symptoms, and the above example is a very
simple one. Although this system sounds suspect to
Western scientists, some interesting parallels have
been observed. For instance, Western medicine has
observed that with severe heart problems, kidney failure often follows, but it still does not know exactly
why. In Chinese medicine, this connection between the
two organs has long been established.
MEDICAL PROBLEMS AND ACUPUNCTURE. In
Chinese medicine, disease as seen as imbalances in
the organ system or chi meridians, and the goal of
any remedy or treatment is to assist the body in reestablishing its innate harmony. Disease can be caused
by internal factors like emotions, external factors like
the environment and weather, and other factors like
injuries, trauma, diet, and germs. However, infection
is seen not as primarily a problem with germs and
viruses, but as a weakness in the energy of the body
which is allowing a sickness to occur. In Chinese medicine, no two illnesses are ever the same, as each body
has its own characteristics of symptoms and balance.
Acupuncture is used to open or adjust the flow of chi
throughout the organ system, which will strengthen
the body and prompt it to heal itself.
A VISIT TO THE ACUPUNCTURIST. The first thing
an acupuncturist will do is get a thorough idea of a
patient’s medical history and symptoms, both physical and emotional. This is done with a long questionnaire and interview. Then the acupuncturist will
examine the patient to find further symptoms, looking closely at the tongue, the pulse at various points
in the body, the complexion, general behavior,
and other signs like coughs or pains. From this, the
practitioner will be able to determine patterns of

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Acupuncture needles are always sterilized and
acupuncture is a very safe procedure. The depth of
insertion of needles varies, depending on which chi
channels are being treated. Some points barely go
beyond superficial layers of skin, while some acupuncture points require a depth of 1-3 in (2.5-7.5 cm) of
needle. The needles generally do not cause pain.
Patients sometimes report pinching sensations and
often pleasant sensations, as the body experiences
healing. Depending on the problem, the acupuncturist
might spin or move the needles, or even pass a slight
electrical current through some of them. Moxibustion
may be sometimes used, in which an herbal mixture
(moxa or mugwort) is either burned like incense on the
acupuncture point or on the end of the needle, which
is believed to stimulate chi in a particular way. Also,
acupuncturists sometimes use cupping, during which
small suction cups are placed on meridian points to
stimulate them.
How long the needles are inserted also varies.
Some patients only require a quick in and out insertion to clear problems and provide tonification
(strengthening of health), while some other conditions might require needles inserted up to an hour or
more. The average visit to an acupuncturist takes
about thirty minutes. The number of visits to the
acupuncturist varies as well, with some conditions
improved in one or two sessions and others requiring
a series of six or more visits over the course of weeks
or months.
Costs for acupuncture can vary, depending
on whether the practitioner is an MD. Initial visits
with non-MD acupuncturists can run from $50$100, with follow-up visits usually costing less.
Insurance reimbursement also varies widely, depending on the company and state. Regulations have been
changing often. Some states authorize Medicaid to
cover acupuncture for certain conditions, and some
states have mandated that general coverage pay
for acupuncture. Consumers should be aware of
the provisions for acupuncture in their individual
policies.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Precautions
Acupuncture is generally a very safe procedure. If
a patient is in doubt about a medical condition, more
than one physician should be consulted. Also, a
patient should always feel comfortable and confident
that their acupuncturist is knowledgable and properly
trained.

Research and general acceptance
Mainstream medicine has been slow to accept
acupuncture; although more MDs are using it, the
American Medical Association does not recognize
it as a specialty. The reason for this is that the
mechanism of acupuncture is difficult to scientifically understand or measure, such as the invisible
energy of chi in the body. Western medicine,
admitting that acupuncture works in many cases,
has theorized that the energy meridians are actually part of the nervous system and that acupuncture relieves pain by releasing endorphins, or
natural pain killers, into the bloodstream. Despite
the ambiguity in the biochemistry involved, acupuncture continues to show effectiveness in clinical
tests, from reducing pain to alleviating the symptoms of chronic illnesses, and research in acupuncture is currently growing. The Office of Alternative
Medicine of the National Institute of Health is
currently funding research in the use of acupuncture for treating depression and attention-deficit
disorder.

are imbalanced. Depending on the problem, the acupuncturist will insert needles to manipulate chi on
one or more of the twelve organ meridians. On these
twelve meridians, there are nearly 2,000 points which
can be used in acupuncture, with around 200 points
being most frequently used by traditional acupuncturists. During an individual treatment, one to
twenty needles may be used, depending on which

Acute kidney failure

I Acute kidney failure

KEY TERMS

Definition

Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)—A waste product that
is formed in the liver and collects in the bloodstream; patients with kidney failure have high
BUN levels.
Creatinine—A protein produced by muscle that
healthy kidneys filter out.

Acute kidney failure occurs when illness, infection, or injury damages the kidneys. Temporarily, the
kidneys cannot adequately remove fluids and wastes
from the body or maintain the proper level of certain
kidney-regulated chemicals in the bloodstream.

Extracorporeal—Outside of, or unrelated to, the
body.

Description
The kidneys are the body’s natural filtration
system. They perform the critical task of processing approximately 200 quarts of fluid in the
bloodstream every 24 hours. Waste products like
urea and toxins, along with excess fluids, are
removed from the bloodstream in the form of
urine. Kidney (or renal) failure occurs when kidney
functioning becomes impaired. Fluids and toxins
begin to accumulate in the bloodstream. As fluids
build up in the bloodstream, the patient with acute
kidney failure may become puffy and swollen (edematous) in the face, hands, and feet. Their blood
pressure typically begins to rise, and they may
experience fatigue and nausea.
Unlike chronic kidney failure, which is long
term and irreversible, acute kidney failure is a
temporary condition. With proper and timely treatment, it can typically be reversed. Often there is no
permanent damage to the kidneys. Acute kidney
failure appears most frequently as a complication
of serious illness, like heart failure, liver failure,
dehydration, severe burns, and excessive bleeding
(hemorrhage). It may also be caused by an
obstruction to the urinary tract or as a direct result
of kidney disease, injury, or an adverse reaction to
a medicine.

Causes and symptoms
Acute kidney failure can be caused by many different illnesses, injuries, and infections. These conditions
fall into three main categories: prerenal, postrenal, and
intrarenal conditions.
Prerenal conditions do not damage the kidney,
but can cause diminished kidney function. They are
the most common cause of acute renal failure, and
include:


dehydration



hemorrhage



septicemia, or sepsis

46

Ischemia—A lack of blood supply to an organ or
tissue.
Nephrotoxic—Toxic, or damaging, to the kidney.
Radiocontrast agents—Dyes administered to a
patient for the purposes of a radiologic study.
Sepsis—A bacterial infection of the bloodstream.
Vasopressors—Medications that constrict the
blood vessels.



heart failure



liver failure



burns

Postrenal conditions cause kidney failure by
obstructing the urinary tract. These conditions
include:


inflammation of the prostate gland in men
(prostatitis)



enlargement of the prostate gland (benign prostatic
hypertrophy)



bladder or pelvic tumors



kidney stones (calculi)

Intrarenal conditions involve kidney disease
or direct injury to the kidneys. These conditions
include:


lack of blood supply to the kidneys (ischemia)



use of radiocontrast agents in patients with kidney
problems



drug abuse or overdose



long-term use of nephrotoxic medications, like certain pain medicines



acute inflammation of the glomeruli, or filters, of the
kidney (glomerulonephritis)



kidney infections (pyelitis or pyelonephritis).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



anemia. The kidneys are responsible for producing
erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone that stimulates red
blood cell production. If kidney disease causes
shrinking of the kidney, red blood cell production is
reduced, leading to anemia.



bad breath or bad taste in mouth. Urea in the saliva
may cause an ammonia-like taste in the mouth.



bone and joint problems. The kidneys produce
vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium
and keeps bones strong. For patients with kidney
failure, bones may become brittle. In children,
normal growth may be stunted. Joint pain may
also occur as a result of high phosphate levels
in the blood. Retention of uric acid may cause
gout.



edema. Puffiness or swelling in the arms, hands, feet,
and around the eyes.



frequent urination.



foamy or bloody urine. Protein in the urine may
cause it to foam significantly. Blood in the urine
may indicate bleeding from diseased or obstructed
kidneys, bladder, or ureters.



headaches. High blood pressure may trigger
headaches.



hypertension, or high blood pressure. The retention
of fluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase.
This makes blood pressure rise.



increased fatigue. Toxic substances in the blood and
the presence of anemia may cause the patient to feel
exhausted.



itching. Phosphorus, normally eliminated in the
urine, accumulates in the blood of patients with
kidney failure. An increased phosphorus level may
cause the skin to itch.



lower back pain. Patients suffering from certain kidney problems (like kidney stones and other obstructions) may have pain where the kidneys are located,
in the small of the back below the ribs.



nausea. Urea in the gastric juices may cause upset
stomach.

Diagnosis
Kidney failure is diagnosed by a doctor. A
nephrologist, a doctor that specializes in the kidney, may be consulted to confirm the diagnosis and
recommend treatment options. The patient that is
suspected of having acute kidney failure will have
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

blood and urine tests to determine the level of
kidney function. A blood test will assess the levels
of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric
acid, phosphate, sodium, and potassium. The kidney regulates these agents in the blood. Urine samples will also be collected, usually over a 24-hour
period, to assess protein loss and/or creatinine
clearance.
Determining the cause of kidney failure is critical
to proper treatment. A full assessment of the kidneys
is necessary to determine if the underlying disease
is treatable and if the kidney failure is chronic or
acute. X rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
computed tomography scan (CT), ultrasound, renal
biopsy, and/or arteriogram of the kidneys may be
used to determine the cause of kidney failure and
level of remaining kidney function. X rays and ultrasound of the bladder and/or ureters may also be
needed.

Treatment
Treatment for acute kidney failure varies.
Treatment is directed to the underlying, primary medical condition that has triggered kidney failure.
Prerenal conditions may be treated with replacement
fluids given through a vein, diuretics, blood transfusion,
or medications. Postrenal conditions and intrarenal
conditions may require surgery and/or medication.
Frequently, patients in acute kidney failure
require hemodialysis, hemofiltration, or peritoneal
dialysis to filter fluids and wastes from the bloodstream until the primary medical condition can be
controlled.

Hemodialysis
Hemodialysis involves circulating the patient’s
blood outside of the body through an extracorporeal
circuit (ECC), or dialysis circuit. The ECC is made up
of plastic blood tubing, a filter known as a dialyzer (or
artificial kidney), and a dialysis machine that monitors
and maintains blood flow and administers dialysate.
Dialysate is a sterile chemical solution that is used to
draw waste products out of the blood. The patient’s
blood leaves the body through the vein and travels
through the ECC and the dialyzer, where fluid
removal takes place.
During dialysis, waste products in the bloodstream are carried out of the body. At the same time,
electrolytes and other chemicals are added to the
blood. The purified, chemically-balanced blood is
then returned to the body.
47

Acute kidney failure

Common symptoms of acute kidney failure
include:

Acute kidney failure

A dialysis ‘‘run’’ typically lasts three to four hours,
depending on the type of dialyzer used and the physical
condition of the patient. Dialysis is used several times a
week until acute kidney failure is reversed.
Blood pressure changes associated with hemodialysis may pose a risk for patients with heart problems.
Peritoneal dialysis may be the preferred treatment
option in these cases.

Hemofiltration
Hemofiltration, also called continuous renal
replacement therapy (CRRT), is a slow, continuous
blood filtration therapy used to control acute kidney
failure in critically ill patients. These patients are
typically very sick and may have heart problems or
circulatory problems. They cannot handle the rapid
filtration rates of hemodialysis. They also frequently
need antibiotics, nutrition, vasopressors, and other
fluids given through a vein to treat their primary
condition. Because hemofiltration is continuous,
prescription fluids can be given to patients in kidney
failure without the risk of fluid overload.
Like hemodialysis, hemofiltration uses an ECC.
A hollow fiber hemofilter is used instead of a dialyzer
to remove fluids and toxins. Instead of a dialysis
machine, a blood pump makes the blood flow through
the ECC. The volume of blood circulating through
the ECC in hemofiltration is less than that in hemodialysis. Filtration rates are slower and gentler on the
circulatory system. Hemofiltration treatment will
generally be used until kidney failure is reversed.

Peritoneal dialysis
Peritoneal dialysis may be used if an acute kidney
failure patient is stable and not in immediate crisis.
In peritoneal dialysis (PD), the lining of the patient’s
abdomen, the peritoneum, acts as a blood filter.
A flexible tube-like instrument (catheter) is surgically
inserted into the patient’s abdomen. During treatment, the catheter is used to fill the abdominal cavity
with dialysate. Waste products and excess fluids move
from the patient’s bloodstream into the dialysate
solution. After a certain time period, the waste-filled
dialysate is drained from the abdomen, and replaced
with clean dialysate. There are three type of peritoneal
dialysis, which vary according to treatment time and
administration method.
Peritoneal dialysis is often the best treatment
option for infants and children. Their small size can
make vein access difficult to maintain. It is not recommended for patients with abdominal adhesions or
48

other abdominal defects (like a hernia) that might
reduce the efficiency of the treatment. It is also not
recommended for patients who suffer frequent bouts
of an inflammation of the small pouches in the intestinal tract (diverticulitis).

Prognosis
Because many of the illnesses and underlying
conditions that often trigger acute kidney failure
are critical, the prognosis for these patients many
times is not good. Studies have estimated overall
death rates for acute kidney failure at 42-88%.
Many people, however, die because of the primary
disease that has caused the kidney failure. These
figures may also be misleading because patients
who experience kidney failure as a result of less
serious illnesses (like kidney stones or dehydration)
have an excellent chance of complete recovery.
Early recognition and prompt, appropriate treatment are key to patient recovery.
Up to 10% of patients who experience acute
kidney failure will suffer irreversible kidney damage.
They will eventually go on to develop chronic kidney
failure or end-stage renal disease. These patients will
require long-term dialysis or kidney transplantation to
replace their lost renal functioning.

Prevention
Since acute kidney failure can be caused by many
things, prevention is difficult. Medications that may
impair kidney function should be given cautiously.
Patients with pre-existing kidney conditions who are
hospitalized for other illnesses or injuries should be
carefully monitored for kidney failure complications.
Treatments and procedures that may put them at risk
for kidney failure (like diagnostic tests requiring radiocontrast agents or dyes) should be used with extreme
caution.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Definition
Acute lymphangitis is a bacterial infection in the
lymphatic vessels which is characterized by painful,
red streaks below the skin surface. This is a potentially
serious infection which can rapidly spread to the
bloodstream and be fatal.

Description
Acute lymphangitis affects a critical member of
the immune system–the lymphatic system. Waste
materials from nearly every organ in the body drain
into the lymphatic vessels and are filtered in small
organs called lymph nodes. Foreign bodies, such as
bacteria or viruses, are processed in the lymph nodes
to generate an immune response to fight an infection.
In acute lymphangitis, bacteria enter the body
through a cut, scratch, insect bite, surgical wound, or
other skin injury. Once the bacteria enter the lymphatic system, they multiply rapidly and follow the lymphatic vessel like a highway. The infected lymphatic
vessel becomes inflamed, causing red streaks that are
visible below the skin surface. The growth of the bacteria occurs so rapidly that the immune system does
not respond fast enough to stop the infection.
If left untreated, the bacteria can cause tissue
destruction in the area of the infection. A pus-filled,
painful lump called an abscess may be formed in the
infected area. Cellulitis, a generalized infection of
the lower skin layers, may also occur. In addition,
the bacteria may invade the bloodstream and cause
septicemia. Lay people, for that reason, often call
the red streaks seen in the skin ‘‘blood poisoning.’’
Septicemia is a very serious illness and may be fatal.

Causes and symptoms
Acute lymphangitis is most often caused by the
bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes. This potentially
dangerous bacterium also causes strep throat, infections of the heart, spinal cord, and lungs, and in the
1990s has been called the ‘‘flesh-eating bacterium.’’
Staphylococci bacteria may also cause lymphangitis.
Although anyone can develop lymphangitis, some
people are more at risk. People who have had radical
mastectomy (removal of a breast and nearby lymph
nodes), a leg vein removed for coronary bypass surgery, or recurrent lymphangitis caused by tinea pedis
(a fungal infection on the foot) are at an increased risk
for lymphangitis.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS
Biopsy—The process which removes a sample of
diseased or infected tissue for microscopic examination to aid in diagnosis.
Lymphatic system—A component of the immune
system consisting of vessels and nodes. Waste
materials from organs drain into the lymphatic vessels and are filtered by the lymph nodes.
Septicemia—Disease caused by the presence and
growth of bacteria in the bloodstream.

The characteristic symptoms of acute lymphangitis are the wide, red streaks which travel from the site
of infection to the armpit or groin. The affected areas
are red, swollen, and painful. Blistering of the affected
skin may occur. The bacterial infection causes a fever
of 100-104 8F (38-40 8C). In addition, a general ill
feeling, muscle aches, headache, chills, and loss of
appetite may be felt.

Diagnosis
If lymphangitis is suspected, the person should
call his or her doctor immediately or go to an emergency room. Acute lymphangitis could be diagnosed
by the family doctor, infectious disease specialist,
or an emergency room doctor. The painful, red
streaks just below the skin surface and the high
fever are diagnostic of acute lymphangitis. A sample
of blood would be taken for culture to determine
whether the bacteria have entered the bloodstream.
A biopsy (removal of a piece of infected tissue)
sample may be taken for culture to identify which
type of bacteria is causing the infection. Diagnosis is
immediate because it is based primarily on the symptoms. Most insurance policies should cover the
expenses for the diagnosis and treatment of acute
lymphangitis.

Treatment
Because of the serious nature of this infection, treatment would begin immediately even before the bacterial
culture results were available. The only treatment for
acute lymphangitis is to give very large doses of an
antibiotic, usually penicillin, through the vein. Growing streptococcal bacteria are usually eliminated rapidly
and easily by penicillin. The antibiotic clindamycin may
be included in the treatment to kill any streptococci
which are not growing and are in a resting state.

Alternatively, a ‘‘broad spectrum’’ antibiotic may be
used which would kill many different kinds of bacteria.

KEY TERMS
Streptococcus—A gram-positive, round or oval
bacteria in the genus Streptococcus. Group A streptococci cause a number of human diseases including strep throat, impetigo, and ASPGN.

Prognosis
Complete recovery is expected if antibiotic treatment is begun at an early stage of the infection.
However, if untreated, acute lymphangitis can be a
very serious and even deadly disease. Acute lymphangitis that goes untreated can spread, causing tissue
damage. Extensive tissue damage would need to be
repaired by plastic surgery. Spread of the infection
into the bloodstream could be fatal.

Prevention
Although acute lymphangitis can occur in anyone, good hygiene and general health may help to
prevent infections.

one to six weeks (average two weeks) after the streptococcal infection.
APSGN is a relatively uncommon disease affecting about one of every 10,000 people, although four or
five times that many may actually be affected by it
but show no symptoms. APSGN is most prevalent
among boys between the ages of 3 and 7, but it can
occur at any age.

Definition
Acute
poststreptococcal
glomerulonephritis
(APSGN) is an inflammation of the kidney tubules
(glomeruli) that filter waste products from the blood,
following a streptococcal infection such as strep
throat. APSGN is also called postinfectious
glomerulonephritis.

Description
APSGN develops after certain streptococcal
bacteria (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci) have
infected the skin or throat. Antigens from the dead
streptococci clump together with the antibodies that
killed them. These clumps are trapped in the kidney
tubules, cause the tubules to become inflamed, and
impair that organs’ ability to filter and eliminate
body wastes. The onset of APSGN usually occurs
50

Frequent sore throats and a history of streptococcal infection increase the risk of acquiring APSGN.
Symptoms of APSGN include:


fluid accumulation and tissue swelling (edema)
initially in the face and around the eyes, later in
the legs



low urine output (oliguria)



blood in the urine (hematuria)



protein in the urine (proteinuria)



high blood pressure



joint pain or stiffness

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of APSGN is made by taking the
patient’s history, assessing his/her symptoms, and
performing certain laboratory tests. Urinalysis
usually shows blood and protein in the urine.
Concentrations of urea and creatinine (two waste
products normally filtered out of the blood by the
kidneys) in the blood are often high, indicating
impaired kidney function. A reliable, inexpensive
blood test called the anti-streptolysin-O test can
confirm that a patient has or has had a streptococcal infection. A throat culture may also show the
presence of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.

Treatment
Treatment of ASPGN is designed to relieve the
symptoms and prevent complications. Some patients

Prognosis

Dissociation—A reaction to trauma in which the
mind splits off certain aspects of the trauma from conscious awareness. Dissociation can affect the patient’s memory, sense of reality, and sense of identity.

Most children (up to 95%) fully recover from
APSGN in a matter of weeks or months. Most adults
(up to 70%) also recover fully. In those who do
not recover fully, chronic or progressive problems of

I Acute stress disorder
Definition
Acute stress disorder (ASD) is an anxiety disorder
characterized by a cluster of dissociative and anxiety
symptoms occurring within one month of a traumatic
event. (Dissociation is a psychological reaction to
trauma in which the mind tries to cope by ‘‘sealing
off ’’ some features of the trauma from conscious
awareness).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Causes and symptoms
Acute stress disorder is caused by exposure to
trauma, which is defined as a stressor that causes
intense fear and, usually, involves threats to life or
serious injury to oneself or others. Examples are
rape, mugging, combat, natural disasters, etc.
The symptoms of stress disorder include a combining of one or more dissociative and anxiety symptoms with the avoidance of reminders of the traumatic
event. Dissociative symptoms include emotional
detachment, temporary loss of memory, depersonalization, and derealization.
Anxiety symptoms connected with acute stress
disorder include irritability, physical restlessness,
sleep problems, inability to concentrate, and being
easily startled.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of acute stress disorder is based on a
combination of the patient’s history and a physical
examination to rule out diseases that can cause
anxiety. The essential feature is a traumatic event
within one month of the onset of symptoms. Other
diagnostic criteria include:


The symptoms significantly interfere with normal
social or vocational functioning



The symptoms last between two days and four weeks.
51

Acute stress disorder

are advised to stay in bed until they feel better and
to restrict fluid and salt intake. Antibiotics may be
prescribed to kill any lingering streptococcal bacteria,
if their presence is confirmed. Antihypertensives may
be given to help control high blood pressure and
diuretics may be used to reduce fluid retention and
swelling. Kidney dialysis is rarely needed.

Addiction

Treatment
Treatment for acute stress disorder usually
includes a combination of antidepressant medications
and short-term psychotherapy.

Prognosis
The prognosis for recovery is influenced by the
severity and duration of the trauma, the patient’s
closeness to it, and the patient’s previous level of functioning. Favorable signs include a short time period
between the trauma and onset of symptoms, immediate
treatment, and appropriate social support. If the
patient’s symptoms are severe enough to interfere
with normal life and have lasted longer than one
month, the diagnosis may be changed to PTSD. If the
symptoms have lasted longer than one month but are
not severe enough to meet the definition of PTSD, the
diagnosis may be changed to adjustment disorder.
Patients who do not receive treatment for acute
stress disorder are at increased risk for substance abuse
or major depressive disorders.

Prevention
Traumatic events cannot usually be foreseen and,
thus, cannot be prevented. However, in theory, professional intervention soon after a major trauma might
reduce the likelihood or severity of ASD. In addition,
some symptoms of acute stress disorder result from
biochemical changes in the central nervous system,
muscles, and digestive tract that are not subject to
conscious control.

I Addiction
Definition
Addiction is a persistent, compulsive dependence
on a behavior or substance. The term has been partially replaced by the word dependence for substance
abuse. Addiction has been extended, however, to
include mood-altering behaviors or activities. Some
researchers speak of two types of addictions: substance addictions (for example, alcoholism, drug
abuse, and smoking); and process addictions (for
example, gambling, spending, shopping, eating, and
sexual activity). There is a growing recognition that
many addicts, such as polydrug abusers, are addicted
to more than one substance or process.

Description
Addiction is one of the most costly public
health problems in the United States. It is a progressive syndrome, which means that it increases in
severity over time unless it is treated. Substance
abuse is characterized by frequent relapse, or return
to the abused substance. Substance abusers often
make repeated attempts to quit before they are
successful.
The economic cost of substance abuse in the
United States exceeds $414 billion, with health care
costs attributed to substance abuse estimated at more
than $114 billion.
By eighth grade, 52% of adolescents have consumed alcohol, 41% have smoked tobacco, and 20%
have smoked marijuana. Compared to females, males
are almost four times as likely to be heavy drinkers,
nearly one and a half more likely to smoke a pack or
more of cigarettes daily, and twice as likely to smoke
marijuana weekly. However, among adolescents
these gender differences are not as pronounced and
girls are almost as likely to abuse substances such
as alcohol and cigarettes. Although frequent use
of tobacco, cocaine and heavy drinking appears
to remain stable in the 1990s, marijuana use has
increased.
An estimated four million Americans over the age
of 12 used prescription pain relievers, sedatives, and
stimulants for ‘‘nonmedical’’ reasons during one
month.
In the United States, 25% of the population regularly uses tobacco. Tobacco use reportedly kills 2.5
times as many people each year as alcohol and drug
abuse combined. According to data from the World

Addictive personality—A concept that was formerly used to explain addiction as the result of
pre-existing character defects in individuals.
Process addiction—Addiction to certain moodaltering behaviors, such as eating disorders, gambling, sexual activity, overwork, and shopping.

higher doses of a substance to achieve the same
effect previously achieved with a lower dose.

to the discontinuation of use of some drugs after

Health Organization, there were 1.1 billion smokers
worldwide and 10,000 tobacco-related deaths per
day. Furthermore, in the United States, 43% of children aged 2-11 years are exposed to environmental
tobacco smoke, which has been implicated in sudden
infant death syndrome, low birth weight, asthma, middle ear disease, pneumonia, cough, and upper respiratory infection.
Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa,
bulimia nervosa, and binge eating, affect more than
five million American women and men. Fifteen percent of young women have substantially disordered
attitudes toward eating and eating behaviors. More
than 1,000 women die each year from anorexia
nervosa.
A Harvard study found that an estimated 15.4
million Americans suffered from a gambling addiction.
More than one-half (7.9 million) were adolescents.

Genetic factor
Some people appear to be more vulnerable to
addiction because their body chemistry increases
their sensitivity to drugs. Some forms of substance
abuse and dependence seem to run in families; and
this may be the result of a genetic predisposition,
environmental influences, or a combination of both.
Brain structure and function
Using drugs repeatedly over time changes brain
structure and function in fundamental and long-lasting ways. Addiction comes about through an array of
changes in the brain and the strengthening of new
memory connections. Evidence suggests that those
long-lasting brain changes are responsible for the distortions of cognitive and emotional functioning that
characterize addicts, particularly the compulsion to
use drugs. Although the causes of addiction remain
the subject of ongoing debate and research, many
experts now consider addiction to be a brain disease:
a condition caused by persistent changes in brain
structure and function. However, having this brain

Addiction

disease does not absolve the addict of responsibility
for his or her behavior, but it does explain why many
addicts cannot stop using drugs by sheer force of will
alone.
Scientists may have come closer to solving the
brain’s specific involvement in addiction in 2004.
Psychiatrists say they have found the craving center
of the brain that triggers relapse in addicts. The anterior cingulated cortex in the frontal lobe of the brain is
the area responsible for long-term craving in addicts.
Knowing the area of the brain from which long-term
cravings come may help scientists pinpoint therapies.
Social learning
Social learning is considered the most important
single factor in addiction. It includes patterns of use in
the addict’s family or subculture, peer pressure, and
advertising or media influence.
Availability
Inexpensive or readily available tobacco, alcohol,
or drugs produce marked increases in rates of
addiction.
Individual development
Before the 1980s, the so-called addictive personality was used to explain the development of addiction. The addictive personality was described as
escapist, impulsive, dependent, devious, manipulative,
and self-centered. Many doctors now believe that
these character traits develop in addicts as a result of
the addiction, rather than the traits being a cause of
the addiction.

Diagnosis
In addition to a preoccupation with using and
acquiring the abused substance, the diagnosis of
addiction is based on five criteria:


loss of willpower



harmful consequences



unmanageable lifestyle



tolerance or escalation of use



withdrawal symptoms upon quitting

group psychotherapy is often helpful, but only after
substance use has stopped. Anti-addiction medications,
such as methadone and naltrexone, are also commonly
used. A new treatment option has been developed that
allows family physicians to treat heroine addiction
from their offices rather than sending patients to
methadone clinics. The drug is called buprenorphine
(Suboxone).
Researchers continue to work to identify workable pharmacological treatments for various addictions. In 2004, clinical trials were testing a number of
drugs currently in use for other diseases and conditions to see if they could be used to treat addiction.
This would speed up their approval by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA). For example,
cocaine withdrawal is eased by boosting dopamine
levels in the brain, so scientists are studying drugs
that boost dopamine, such as Ritalin, which is used
to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and
amantadine, a drug used for flu and Parkinson’s
diease.
The most frequently recommended social form of
outpatient treatment is the twelve-step program. Such
programs are also frequently combined with psychotherapy. According to a recent study reported
by the American Psychological Association (APA),
anyone, regardless of his or her religious beliefs or
lack of religious beliefs, can benefit from participation
in 12-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous
(AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA). The number of
visits to 12-step self-help groups exceeds the number of
visits to all mental health professionals combined.
There are twelve-step groups for all major substance
and process addictions.
The Twelve Steps are:


Admit powerlessness over the addiction.



Believe that a Power greater than oneself could
restore sanity.



Make a decision to turn your will and your life over
to the care of God, as you understand him.



Make a searching and fearless moral inventory of
self.



Admit to God, yourself, and another human being
the exact nature of your wrongs.



Become willing to have God remove all these defects
from your character.



Humbly ask God to remove shortcomings.



Make a list of all persons harmed by your wrongs
and become willing to make amends to them all.

Treatment
Treatment requires both medical and social
approaches. Substance addicts may need hospital treatment to manage withdrawal symptoms. Individual or

Make direct amends to such people, whenever possible except when to do so would injure them or others.



Continue to take personal inventory and promptly
admit any future wrongdoings.



Seek to improve contact with a God of the individual’s understanding through meditation and prayer.



Carry the message of spiritual awakening to others
and practice these principles in all your affairs.

Prognosis
The prognosis for recovery from any addiction
depends on the substance or process, the individual’s
circumstances, and underlying personality structure.
Polydrug users have the worst prognosis for recovery.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Addison’s disease is a disorder involving disrupted functioning of the part of the adrenal gland
called the cortex. This results in decreased production
of two important chemicals (hormones) normally
released by the adrenal cortex: cortisol and
aldosterone.

Description
The adrenals are two glands, each perched on the
upper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of the
gland is known as the cortex; the inner part is known
as the medulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal
gland is responsible for producing different types of
hormones.
Cortisol is a very potent hormone produced by the
adrenal cortex. It is involved in regulating the functioning of nearly every type of organ and tissue
throughout the body, and is considered to be one of
the few hormones absolutely necessary for life.
Cortisol is involved in:


the very complex processing and utilization of many
nutrients, including sugars (carbohydrates), fats, and
proteins



the normal functioning of the circulatory system and
the heart
55

Addison’s disease



Addison’s disease



the functioning of muscles



normal kidney function



production of blood cells



the normal processes involved in maintaining the
skeletal system



proper functioning of the brain and nerves



the normal responses of the immune system

Aldosterone, also produced by the adrenal cortex,
plays a central role in maintaining the appropriate
proportions of water and salts in the body. When
this balance is upset, the volume of blood circulating
throughout the body will fall dangerously low, accompanied by a drop in blood pressure.
Addison’s disease is also called primary adrenocortical insufficiency. In other words, some process
interferes directly with the ability of the adrenal cortex
to produce its hormones. Levels of both cortisol and
aldosterone drop, and numerous functions throughout the body are disrupted.
Addison’s disease occurs in about four in every
100,000 people. It strikes both men and women of all
ages.

Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of Addison’s disease is
the destruction and/or shrinking (atrophy) of the adrenal cortex. In about 70% of all cases, this atrophy is
believed to occur due to an autoimmune disorder. In an
autoimmune disorder, the immune system of the body,
responsible for identifying foreign invaders such as
viruses or bacteria and killing them, accidentally begins
to identify the cells of the adrenal cortex as foreign,
and destroy them. In about 20% of all cases, destruction of the adrenal cortex is caused by tuberculosis. The
remaining cases of Addison’s disease may be caused
by fungal infections, such as histoplasmosis, coccidiomycosis, and cryptococcosis, which affect the adrenal
gland by producing destructive, tumor-like masses
called granulomas; a disease called amyloidosis, in
which a starchy substance called amyloid is deposited
in abnormal places throughout the body, interfering
with the function of whatever structure it is present
within; or invasion of the adrenal glands by cancer.
In about 75% of all patients, Addison’s disease
tends to be a very gradual, slowly developing disease.
Significant symptoms are not noted until about
90% of the adrenal cortex has been destroyed. The
most common symptoms include fatigue and loss
of energy, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, muscle weakness,
56

KEY TERMS
Gland—A collection of cells whose function is to
release certain chemicals, or hormones, which are
important to the functioning of other, sometimes
distantly located, organs or body systems.
Hormone—A chemical produced in one part of the
body, which travels to another part of the body in
order to exert its effect.

dizziness when standing, dehydration, unusual areas of
darkened (pigmented) skin, and dark freckling. As the
disease progresses, the patient may appear to have
very tanned, or bronzed skin, with darkening of the
lining of the mouth, vagina, and rectum, and dark
pigmentation of the area around the nipples (aereola). As dehydration becomes more severe, the
blood pressure will continue to drop and the patient
will feel increasingly weak and light-headed. Some
patients have psychiatric symptoms, including
depression and irritability. Women lose pubic and
underarm hair, and stop having normal menstrual
periods.
When a patient becomes ill with an infection,
or stressed by an injury, the disease may suddenly and
rapidly progress, becoming life-threatening. Symptoms
of this ‘‘Addisonian crisis’’ include abnormal heart
rhythms, severe pain in the back and abdomen,
uncontrollable nausea and vomiting, a drastic drop in
blood pressure, kidney failure, and unconsciousness.
About 25% of all Addison’s disease patients are
identified due to the development of Addisonian crisis.

Diagnosis
Many patients do not recognize the slow progression of symptoms and the disease is ultimately identified when a physician notices the areas of increased
pigmentation of the skin. Once suspected, a number
of blood tests can lead to the diagnosis of Addison’s
disease. It is not sufficient to demonstrate low blood
cortisol levels, as normal levels of cortisol vary quite
widely. Instead, patients are given a testing dose of
another hormone called corticotropin (ACTH).
ACTH is produced in the body by the pituitary
gland, and normally acts by promoting growth
within the adrenal cortex and stimulating the production and release of cortisol. In Addison’s disease,
even a dose of synthetic ACTH does not increase
cortisol levels.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment
Treatment of Addison’s disease involves replacing the missing or low levels of cortisol. In the case
of Addisonian crisis, this will be achieved by injecting
a potent form of steroid preparation through a needle
placed in a vein (intravenous or IV). Dehydration
and salt loss will also be treated by administering
carefully balanced solutions through the IV.
Dangerously low blood pressure may require special
medications to safely elevate it until the steroids take
effect.
Patients with Addison’s disease will need to take a
steroid preparation (hydrocortisone) and a replacement for aldosterone (fludrocortisone) by mouth for
the rest of their lives. When a patient has an illness
which causes nausea and vomiting (such that they
cannot hold down their medications), he or she will
need to enter a medical facility where IV medications
can be administered. When a patient has any kind of
infection or injury, the normal dose of hydrocortisone
will need to be doubled.

I Adenoid hyperplasia
Definition
Adenoid hyperplasia is the overenlargement of
the lymph glands located above the back of the mouth.

Description
Located at the back of the mouth above and
below the soft palate are two pairs of lymph glands.
The tonsils below are clearly visible behind the back
teeth; the adenoids lie just above them and are hidden
from view by the palate. Together these four arsenals
of immune defense guard the major entrance to the
body from foreign invaders–the germs we breathe and
eat. In contrast to the rest of the body’s tissues, lymphoid tissue reaches its greatest size in mid-childhood
and recedes thereafter. In this way children are best
able to develop the immunities they need to survive in
a world full of infectious diseases.
Beyond its normal growth pattern, lymphoid tissue grows excessively (hypertrophies) during an acute
infection, as it suddenly increases its immune activity
to fight off the invaders. Often it does not completely
return to its former size. Each subsequent infection
leaves behind a larger set of tonsils and adenoids. To
make matters worse, the sponge-like structure of these
hypertrophied glands can produce safe havens for
germs where the body cannot reach and eliminate
them. Before antibiotics and the reduction in infectious
childhood diseases over the past few generations, tonsils and adenoids caused greater health problems.

Prognosis
Prognosis for patients appropriately treated with
hydrocortisone and aldosterone is excellent. These
patients can expect to enjoy a normal lifespan. Without
treatment, or with substandard treatment, patients
are always at risk of developing Addisonian crisis.

Causes and symptoms
Most tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy is simply
caused by the normal growth pattern for that type of
tissue. Less often, the hypertrophy is due to repeated
throat infections by cold viruses, strep throat, mononucleosis, and in times gone by, diphtheria. The acute
infections are usually referred to as tonsillitis, the adenoids getting little recognition because they cannot be
seen without special instruments. Symptoms include
painful, bright red, often ulcerated tonsils, enlargement of lymph nodes (glands) beneath the jaw, fever,
and general discomfort.
After the acute infection subsides, symptoms are
generated simply by the size of the glands. Extremely
large tonsils can impair breathing and swallowing,
although that is quite rare. Large adenoids can impair
nose breathing and require a child to breathe through
the mouth. Because they encircle the only connection
57

Adenoid hyperplasia

To distinguish between primary adrenocortical
insufficiency (Addison’s disease) and secondary adrenocortical insufficiency (caused by failure of the pituitary to produce enough ACTH), levels of ACTH in
the blood are examined. Normal or high levels of
ACTH indicate that the pituitary is working properly,
but the adrenal cortex is not responding normally
to the presence of ACTH. This confirms the diagnosis
of Addison’s disease.

contribution to optimal function in the tonsils and
adenoids. Food allergies are often the culprits for
recurring ear infections, as well as tonsilitis and adenoiditis. Identification and removal of the allergic
food(s) can greatly assist in alleviating the cause of
the problem. Acute tonsillitis also benefits from
warm saline gargles.

Prognosis
Hypertrophied adenoids are a normal part of
growing up and should be respected for their important role in the development of immunity. Only when
their size causes problems by obstructing breathing or
middle ear drainage do they demand intervention.

Prevention
between the middle ear and the eustachian tube,
hypertrophied adenoids can also obstruct it and
cause middle ear infections.

Diagnosis
A simple tongue blade depressing the tongue
allows an adequate view of the tonsils. Enlarged tonsils may have deep pockets (crypts) containing dead
tissue (necrotic debris). Viewing adenoids requires a
small mirror or fiberoptic scope. A child with recurring
middle ear infections may well have large adenoids. A
throat culture or mononucleosis test will usually reveal
the identity of the germ.

Treatment
It used to be standard practice to remove tonsils
and/or adenoids after a few episodes of acute throat or
ear infection. The surgery is called tonsillectomy and
adenoidectomy (T and A). Opinion changed as it was
realized that this tissue is beneficial to the development
of immunity. For instance, children without tonsils
and adenoids produce only half the immunity to oral
polio vaccine. In addition, treatment of ear and throat
infections with antibiotics and of recurring ear infections with surgical drainage through the ear drum
(tympanostomy) has greatly reduced the incidence of
surgical removal of these lymph glands.

Alternative treatment
There are many botanical/herbal remedies that
can be used alone or in formulas to locally assist the
tonsils and adenoids in their immune function at the
opening of the oral cavity and to tone these glands.
Keeping the Eustachian tubes open is an important

Prevention can be directed toward prompt evaluation and appropriate treatment of sore throats to prevent overgrowth of adenoid tissue. Avoiding other
children with acute respiratory illness will also reduce
the spread of these common illnesses.

I Adenovirus infections
Definition
Adenoviruses are DNA viruses (small infectious
agents) that cause upper respiratory tract infections,
conjunctivitis, and other infections in humans.

Description
Adenoviruses were discovered in 1953. About 47
different types have been identified since then, and

Conjunctivitis—Inflammation of the conjunctiva,

about half of them are believed to cause human diseases. Infants and children are most commonly
affected by adenoviruses. Adenovirus infections can
occur throughout the year, but seem to be most common from fall to spring.
Adenoviruses are responsible for 3-5% of acute
respiratory infections in children and 2% of respiratory illnesses in civilian adults. They are more apt to
cause infection among military recruits and other
young people who live in institutional environments.
Outbreaks among children are frequently reported at
boarding schools and summer camps. Another example includes an increased outbreak of gastroenteritis
among cruise passengers in 2002.

by types 3 and 7. Symptoms, which appear suddenly
and usually disappear in less than a week, include:


inflammation of the lining of the eyelid (conjunctivitis)



fever



sore throat (pharyngitis)



runny nose



inflammation of lymph glands in the neck (cervical
adenitis)

Adenoviruses also cause acute diarrhea in young
children, characterized by fever and watery stools.
This condition is caused by adenovirus types 40 and
41 and can last as long as two weeks.
As much as 51% of all hemorrhagic cystitis
(inflammation of the bladder and of the tubes that
carry urine to the bladder from the kidneys) in
American and Japanese children can be attributed to
adenovirus infection. A child who has hemorrhagic
cystitis has bloody urine for about three days, and
invisible traces of blood can be found in the urine a
few days longer. The child will feel the urge to urinate
frequently–but find it difficult to do so–for about the
same length of time.
Adult infections

Acquired immunity
Most children have been infected by at least one
adenovirus by the time they reach school age. Most
adults have acquired immunity to multiple adenovirus
types due to infections they had as children.
In one mode of adenovirus infection (called lytic
infection because it destroys large numbers of cells),
adenoviruses kill healthy cells and replicate up to
one million new viruses per cell killed (of which 1-5%
are infectious). People with this kind of infection feel
sick. In chronic or latent infection, a much smaller number of viruses are released and healthy cells can multiply
more rapidly than they are destroyed. People who have
this kind of infection don’t seem to be sick. This is
probably why many adults have immunity to adenoviruses without realizing they have been infected.
Childhood infections
In children, adenoviruses most often cause acute
upper respiratory infections with fever and runny nose.
Adenovirus types 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are responsible for most
of these infections. Occasionally more serious lower
respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia, may occur.
Adenoviruses also cause acute pharyngoconjunctival fever in children. This disease is most often caused
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

In adults, the most frequently reported adenovirus infection is acute respiratory disease (ARD,
caused by types 4 and 7) in military recruits.
Influenza-like symptoms including fever, sore throat,
runny nose, and cough are almost always present;
weakness, chills, headache, and swollen lymph glands
in the neck also may occur. The symptoms typically
last three to five days.
Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC, caused by
adenovirus types 8, 19, and 37) was first seen in shipyard workers whose eyes had been slightly injured by
chips of rust or paint. This inflammation of tissues
lining the eyelid and covering the front of the eyeball
also can be caused by using contaminated contact lens
solutions or by drying the hands or face with a towel
used by someone who has this infection.
The inflamed, sticky eyelids characteristic of
conjunctivitis develop 4-24 days after exposure and
last between one and four weeks. Only 5-8% of
patients with epidemic keratoconjunctivitis experience
respiratory symptoms. One or both eyes may be
affected. As symptoms of conjunctivitis subside, eye
pain and watering and blurred vision develop. These
symptoms of keratitis may last for several months, and
about 10% of these infections spread to at least one
other member of the patient’s household.

Other illnesses associated with adenovirus include:


encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and other
infections of the central nervous system (CNS)



gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and
intestines)



acute mesenteric lymphadenitis (inflammation of
lymph glands in the abdomen)



chronic interstitial fibrosis (abnormal growth of
connective tissue between cells)



intussusception (a type of intestinal obstruction)



pneumonia that doesn’t respond to antibiotic therapy



whooping cough syndrome when Bordetella pertussis
(the bacterium that causes classic whooping cough) is
not found

Causes and symptoms
Specific adenovirus infections can be traced to
particular sources and produce distinctive symptoms.
In general, however, adenovirus infection is caused by:


inhaling airborne viruses



getting the virus in the eyes by swimming in contaminated water, using contaminated eye solutions or
instruments, wiping the eyes with contaminated
towels, or rubbing the eyes with contaminated fingers.



not washing the hands after using the bathroom, and
then touching the mouth or eyes

Symptoms common to most types of adenovirus
infections include:


cough



fever



runny nose



sore throat



watery eyes

Treatment
Treatment of adenovirus infections is usually
supportive and aimed at relieving symptoms of the
illness. Bed rest may be recommended along with
medications to reduce fever and/or pain. (Aspirin
should not be given to children because of concerns
about Reye’s syndrome.) Eye infections may benefit
from topical corticosteroids to relieve symptoms and
shorten the course of the disease. Hospitalization is
usually required for severe pneumonia in infants and
for EKC (to prevent blindness). No effective antiviral
drugs have been developed.

Prognosis
Adenovirus infections are rarely fatal. Most
patients recover fully.

Prevention
Practicing good personal hygiene and avoiding
people with infectious illnesses can reduce the
risk of developing adenovirus infection. Proper handwashing can prevent the spread of the virus by oralfecal transmission. Sterilization of instruments and
solutions used in the eye can prevent the spread of
EKC, as can adequate chlorination of swimming
pools.
A vaccine for pertussis has been developed
and is in use in combination with diphtheria and tetanus vaccines for infants. It is shown to have nearly
90% efficacy. A vaccine containing live adenovirus
types 4 and 7 is used to control disease in military
recruits, but it is not recommended or available for
civilian use. A recent resurgence of the adenovirus
was found in a military population as soon as the
vaccination program was halted. Vaccines prepared
from purified subunits of adenovirus are under
investigation.
Resources

Diagnosis
Although symptoms may suggest the presence of
adenovirus, distinguishing these infections from other
viruses can be difficult. A definitive diagnosis is based
on culture or detection of the virus in eye secretions,
sputum, urine, or stool.
The extent of infection can be estimated from the
results of blood tests that measure increases in the
quantity of antibodies the immune system produces to
fight it. Antibody levels begin to rise about a week after
infection occurs and remain elevated for about a year.

Adhesions are fibrous bands of scar tissue that
form between internal organs and tissues, joining
them together abnormally.

Description
Adhesions are made up of blood vessels and fibroblasts—connective tissue cells. They form as a normal
part of the body’s healing process and help to limit
the spread of infection. However when adhesions
cause the wrong tissues to grow into each other,
many different complex inflammatory disorders can
arise. Worldwide millions of people suffer pain and
dysfunction due to adhesion disease.
Depending on their location, the most common
types of adhesions may called:


abdominal adhesions



intestinal adhesions



intraperitoneal adhesions



pelvic adhesions



intrauterine adhesions or Asherman’s syndrome.

Adhesions can form between various tissues in the
body including:


loops of the intestines



the intestines and other abdominal organs or the
abdominal wall



abdominal organs such as the liver or bladder and
the abdominal wall



tissues of the uterus.

Although adhesions can be congenital (present at
birth) or result from inflammation, injury, or infection, the vast majority of adhesions form following
surgery. Adhesions are a major complication of
many common surgical procedures and may occur in
55% to more than 90% of patients, depending on the
type of surgery.
All abdominal surgeries carry the risk of adhesion
formation. Abdominal adhesions are rare in people
who have not had abdominal surgery and very common in people who have had multiple abdominal surgeries. Adhesions are more common following
procedures involving the intestines, colon, appendix,
or uterus. They are less common following surgeries
involving the stomach, gall bladder, or pancreas.

Adhesions

I Adhesions

Adhesions

Postoperative intestinal adhesions are a major
cause of intestinal or small bowel obstruction (SBO).
In a small number of people the scar tissue pulls sections of the small or large intestines out of place and
partially or completely blocks the passage of food and
fluids. Thus SBOs can result from abdominal surgery
and also are one of the most common reasons for
abdominal surgery. Although intestinal obstruction
is fatal in about 5% of patients, the mortality rate
associated with SBO has decreased dramatically over
the past century.
Intrauterine adhesions are relatively common in
women and the majority of women undergoing gynecological surgery develop postoperative adhesions.
Sometimes these pelvic adhesions cause chronic pelvic
pain and/or infertility.
Adhesions can cause a rare form of glaucoma
called irido corneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome. In
this disorder cells from the back surface of the cornea
of the eye spread over the surface of the iris and the
tissue that drains the eye, forming adhesions that bind
the iris to the cornea and causing further blockage of
the drainage channels. This blockage increases the
pressure inside the eye, which may damage the optic
nerve. ICE syndrome occurs most often in lightskinned females.

Causes and symptoms
Post-surgical adhesions
Common causes of postoperative adhesions
include:


abdominal surgery



gynecological surgery



thoracic surgery



orthopedic surgery



plastic surgery.

Abdominal adhesions most often result from surgeries in which the organs are handled or temporarily
moved. Intrauterine adhesions form after surgeries
involving the uterus, particularly curettage—the
scraping of the uterine contents. Surgery to control
uterine bleeding after giving birth also can lead to
intrauterine adhesions. Such adhesions can cause
Asherman’s syndrome, closing the uterus and preventing menstruation.
Other causes of adhesions
Any inflammation or infection of the membranes
that line the abdominal and pelvic walls and enclose
62

the organs—the peritoneum—can cause adhesions.
An example peritonitis, a severe infection that can
result from appendicitis, may lead to adhesions. In
addition to surgery or injury, pelvic adhesions can be
caused by inflammation resulting from an infection
such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).
Symptoms
In the majority of people adhesions do not cause
symptoms or serious problems. However in some people adhesions can lead to a variety of disorders. The
symptoms depend on the type of adhesion and the
tissues that are involved. Adhesions may cause pain
and/or fever in some people.
ABDOMINAL OBSTRUCTION. If a loop of intestine
becomes trapped under an adhesion, the intestine may
become partially or completely blocked. The symptoms of intestinal obstruction or SBOs due to adhesions depend on the degree and location of the
obstruction. Partial or off-and-on intestinal obstruction due to adhesions may result in intermittent periods of painful abdominal cramping and other
symptoms, including diarrhea.

Symptoms of significant intestinal obstruction
due to adhesions include:


severe abdominal pain and cramping



nausea and vomiting



abdominal distension (swelling)



constipation and the inability to pass gas



symptoms of dehydration.
Symptoms of dehydration include:



dry mouth and tongue



severe thirst



infrequent urination



dry skin



fast heart rate



low blood pressure.

In about 10% of SBOs, part of the intestine twists
tightly and repeatedly around a band of adhesions,
cutting off the blood supply to the intestine and resulting in strangulation and death of the twisted bowel.
The mortality rate for strangulation of the bowel may
be as high as 37%.
Symptoms of bowel strangulation due to adhesions include:


severe abdominal pain, either cramping or constant
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

abdominal distension due to the inability to pass
stool and gas



an extremely tender abdomen



signs of systemic (body-wide) illness, including fever,
fast heart rate, and low blood pressure.

When a portion of the obstructed bowel begins to
die from lack of blood flow, fluids and bacteria that
help digest food can leak out of the intestinal wall and
into the abdominal cavity causing peritonitis.
PELVIC ADHESIONS. Pelvic adhesions can interfere
with the functioning of the ovaries and fallopian tubes
and are among the common causes of female infertility. Adhesions on the ovaries or fallopian tubes can
prevent pregnancy by trapping the released egg.
Adhesions resulting from endometriosis can cause pelvic pain, particularly during menstruation, as well as
fertility problems.

Diagnosis
Adhesions are diagnosed based on the symptoms,
surgical history, and a physical examination. The physician examines the abdomen and rectum and performs
a pelvic examination on women. Blood tests and chest
and abdominal x rays are taken. Sometimes exploratory surgery is used to locate the adhesions and
sources of pain.
Abdominal computed axial tomography—a CT
or CAT scan—is the most common diagnostic tool
for SBO and intestinal strangulation due to adhesions.
In this procedure a computer reconstructs a portion
of the abdomen from x-ray scans. Barium contrast
x-ray studies also may be used to locate an obstruction. The ingestion of a barium solution provides better visualization of the abdominal organs. However
sometimes intestinal obstruction or strangulation
cannot be confirmed without abdominal surgery.
Exploratory laparoscopy may be used to detect
either abdominal or pelvic adhesions. This procedure
usually is performed in a hospital under local or general anesthesia. A small incision is made near the naval
and carbon dioxide gas is injected to raise the abdominal wall. A tube called a trocar is inserted into the
abdomen. The laparascope, equipped with a light and
a small video camera, is passed through the trocar
for visualization of the peritoneal cavity and the
abdominal or pelvic organs.
Pelvic adhesions also may be detected by hysteroscopy. In this procedure a uterine endoscope is
inserted through the cervix to visualize the cervix and
uterine cavity. With hysterosalpingography (HSG) a
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

radiopaque or contrast dye is injected through a catheter in the cervix and x rays are taken of the uterus and
fallopian tubes.

Treatment
Although the symptoms of adhesion disease
sometimes disappear on their own, adhesions are permanent without a surgical procedure called adhesion
lysis to disrupt or remove the tissue.
Abdominal adhesions
Sometimes an adhesion-trapped intestine frees
itself spontaneously. Surgery may be used to reposition the intestine to relieve symptoms. Various other
techniques include using suction to decompress the
intestine; however untreated intestinal adhesions may
lead to bowel obstruction.
Although dilation with an endoscope may be used
to widen the region around an intestinal obstruction to
relieve symptoms, SBOs caused almost always require
immediate surgery. In cases of a partial obstruction or
a complete obstruction without severe symptoms, surgery may be delayed for 12–24 hours so that a dehydrated patient can be treated with intravenous fluids.
A small suction tube may be placed through the nose
into the stomach to remove the stomach contents to
relieve pain and nausea and prevent further bloating.
If an adhesion-related SBO disrupts the blood
supply to part of the intestine, gangrene—tissue
death—can occur. Strangulation of the bowel usually
requires emergency abdominal surgery to remove the
adhesions and restore blood flow to the intestine.
Intestinal obstruction repair is performed under general anesthesia. An incision is made in the abdomen,
the obstruction is located, and the adhesions are cut
away, releasing the intestine. The bowel is examined
for injury or tissue death. If possible, injured and dead
sections are removed and the healthy ends of the intestine are stitched together (resectioned). If resectioning
is not possible, the ends of the intestine are brought
through an opening in the abdomen called an ostomy.
In some cases laparoscopic surgery can be used to
removed damaged portions of the intestines. Five or
six small incisions—0.2–0.4 in. (5–10 mm) in length—
are made in the abdomen. The laparoscope, equipped
with its light and camera, and surgical instruments are
inserted through the incisions. The laparoscope guides
the surgeon by projecting images of the abdominal
organs on a video monitor. However the existence of
multiple adhesions may preclude the use of laparoscopic surgery.

Adhesions caused by endometriosis may be
removed by either traditional open abdominal or pelvic surgery or by laparoscopic surgery. In the latter
technique the laparoscope includes a laser for destroying the tissue with heat. Although untreated gynecological adhesions can lead to infertility, both types of
surgeries also can result in adhesion formation.







ICE-type glaucoma caused by adhesions is difficult to treat; however untreated ICE syndrome can
lead to blindness. Treatment usually includes medication and/or filtering surgery. Filtering microsurgery
involves cutting a tiny hole in the white of the eye
(the sclera) to allow fluid to drain, thereby lowering
the pressure in the eye and preventing or reducing
damage to the optic nerve.

Systemic anti-inflammatory medications may be
used to help prevent adhesion formation. Recent studies suggest that the common oral arthritis drug,
Celebrex, an anti-inflammatory COX-2 inhibitor,
taken before and immediately after surgery, may
help prevent abdominal adhesions. Celebrex is
known to inhibit both the formation of blood vessels
and fibroblast activity, which are necessary for the
formation of scar tissue.

Alternative treatment
In cases where the intestines are partially blocked
by adhesions, a diet low in fiber—called a low-residue
diet—may enable food to move more easily through
the obstruction.

Prognosis
Intestinal obstruction surgery usually has a favorable outcome if the surgery is performed before tissue
damage or death occurs. Surgery to remove adhesions
and to free or reconnect the intestine often is sufficient
for reducing symptoms and returning normal function
to the intestine or other organ. However the risk of
new adhesion formation increases with each additional surgery. Thus abdominal adhesions can become
a recurring problem. Adhesions reform in 11–21% of
patients who have surgery to remove an adhesionrelated intestinal obstruction. The risk of recurrence
is particularly high among survivors of bowel
strangulation.

Prevention
Abdominal and gynecological laparoscopic surgeries—also known as ‘‘keyhole’’ surgeries—reduce
the size of the incision and the amount of contact
with the organs, thereby lowering the risk of adhesion
formation. Sometimes the intestines are fixed in place
during surgery so as to promote benign adhesions that
will not cause obstructions.
Within five days after surgery the disturbed tissue
surfaces have formed a new lining of mesothelial cells
that prevent adhesions from forming. Therefore biodegradable barrier membranes, films, gels, or sprays
64

Recent research has focused on the incorporation
of anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferation drugs into
polymeric films used for preventing and treating postsurgical adhesions. New types of gels to prevent postoperative adhesions also are under development.

KEY TERMS

Definition

Multiple sclerosis—A progressive disorder of the
central nervous system in which scattered patches
of the protective sheath covering the nerves is
destroyed. The disease, which causes progressive
paralysis, is marked by periods of exacerbation and
remission. There is no cure.

An adjustment disorder is a debilitating reaction,
usually lasting less than six months, to a stressful event
or situation. It is not the same thing as post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), which usually occurs in reaction to a life-threatening event and can be longer
lasting.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)—A specific
form of anxiety that begins after a life-threatening
event, such as rape, a natural disaster, or combatrelated trauma.

Description
An adjustment disorder usually begins within
three months of a stressful event, and ends within six
months after the stressor stops. There are many different subtypes of adjustment disorders, including
adjustment disorder with:



crying



anxiety



depression



worry



anxiety



headaches or stomachaches



mixed anxiety and depression



withdrawal



conduct disturbances



inhibition



mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct



truancy



unspecified



vandalism



reckless driving



fighting



other destructive acts

Adjustment disorders are very common and can
affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, race, or lifestyle. By definition, an adjustment disorder is shortlived, unless a person is faced with a chronic recurring
crisis (such as a child who is repeatedly abused). In
such cases, the adjustment disorder may last more
than six months.

Causes and symptoms
An adjustment disorder occurs when a person
can’t cope with a stressful event and develops emotional or behavioral symptoms. The stressful event can
be anything: it might be just one isolated incident, or a
string of problems that wears the person down. The
stress might be anything from a car accident or illness,
to a divorce, or even a certain time of year (such as
Christmas or summer).
People with adjustment disorder may have a wide
variety of symptoms. How those symptoms combine
depend on the particular subtype of adjustment disorder and on the individual’s personality and psychological defenses. Symptoms normally include some
(but not all) of the following:


hopelessness



sadness

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis
It is extremely important that a thorough evaluation rule out other more serious mental disorders,
since the treatment for adjustment disorder may be
very different than for other mental problems.
In order to be diagnosed as a true adjustment
disorder, the level of distress must be more severe
than what would normally be expected in response to
the stressor, or the symptoms must significantly interfere with a person’s social, job, or school functioning.
Normal expression of grief, in bereavement for
instance, is not considered an adjustment disorder.

Treatment
Psychotherapy (counseling) is the treatment of
choice for adjustment disorders, since the symptoms
are an understandable reaction to a specific stress. The
type of therapy depends on the mental health expert,
but it usually is short-term treatment that focuses on
resolving the immediate problem.
65

Adjustment disorders

I Adjustment disorders

Adrenal gland cancer

Therapy usually will help clients:


develop coping skills



understand how the stressor has affected their lives



develop alternate social or recreational activities

Family or couples therapy may be helpful in some
cases. Medications are not usually used to treat adjustment disorders, although sometimes a few days or
weeks of an anti-anxiety drug can control anxiety or
sleeping problems.
Self-help groups aimed at a specific problem (such
as recovering from divorce or job loss) can be extremely helpful to people suffering from an adjustment
disorder. Social support, which is usually an important part of self-help groups, can lead to a quicker
recovery.

Prognosis
Most people recover completely from adjustment
disorders, especially if they had no previous history of
mental problems, and have a stable home life with
strong social support. People with progressive or cyclic
disorders (such as multiple sclerosis) may experience an
adjustment disorder with each exacerbation period.

When tumors develop in the adrenal gland, they
secrete excess amounts of these hormones. A cancer
that arises in the adrenal cortex is called an adrenocortical carcinoma and can produce high blood pressure, weight gain, excess body hair, weakening of the
bones and diabetes. A cancer in the adrenal medulla is
called a pheochromocytoma and can cause high blood
pressure, headache, palpitations, and excessive perspiration. Although these cancers can happen at any
age, most occur in young adults.

Causes and symptoms
It is not known what causes adrenal gland cancer,
but some cases are associated with hereditary diseases.
Symptoms of adrenal cancer are related to the specific
hormones produced by that tumor. An adrenocortical
carcinoma typically secretes high amounts of cortisol,
producing Cushing’s Syndrome. This syndrome produces progressive weight gain, rounding of the face,
and increased blood pressure. Women can experience
menstrual cycle alterations and men can experience
feminization. The symptoms for pheochromocytoma
include hypertension, acidosis, unexplained fever and
weight loss. Because of the hormones produced by this
type of tumor, anxiety is often a feature also.

Diagnosis for adrenal cancer usually begins with
blood tests to evaluate the hormone levels. These hormones include epinephrine, cortisol, and testosterone.
It also includes magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomography scans to determine the extent of the
disease. Urine and blood tests can be done to detect
the high levels of hormone secreted by the tumor.

Treatment

I Adrenal gland cancer
Definition
Adrenal gland cancers are rare cancers occuring in
the endocrine tissue of the adrenals. They are characterized by overproduction of adrenal gland hormones.

Description
Cancers of the adrenal gland are very rare. The
adrenal gland is a hormone producing endocrine gland
with two main parts, the cortex and the medulla. The
main hormone of the adrenal cortex is cortisol and the
main hormone of the adrenal medulla is epinephrine.
66

Treatment is aimed at removing the tumor by
surgery. In some cases, this can be done by laparoscopy. Surgery is sometimes followed by chemotherapy
and/or radiation therapy. Because the surgery removes
the source of many important hormones, hormones
must be supplemented following surgery. If adrenocortical cancer recurs or has spread to other parts of
the body (metastasized), additional surgery may be
done followed by chemotherapy using the drug
mitotane.

Alternative treatment
As with any form of cancer, all conventional treatment options should be considered and applied as

appropriate. Nutritional support, as well as supporting the functioning of the entire person diagnosed with
adrenal gland cancer through homeopathic medicine,
acupuncture, vitamin and mineral supplementation,
and herbal medicine, can benefit recovery and enhance
quality of life.

I Adrenal gland scan
Definition
The adrenal gland scan is a nuclear medicine evaluation of the medulla (inner tissue) of the adrenal
gland.

Purpose
The adrenal glands are a pair of small organs
located just above the kidney, which contain two
types of tissue. The adrenal cortex produces hormones
that affect water balance and metabolism in the body.
The adrenal medulla produces adrenaline and noradrenaline (also called epinepherine and norepinepherine).
An adrenal gland scan is done when too much
adrenaline and noradrenaline is produced in the
body and a tumor in the adrenal gland is suspected.
One such situation in which a tumor might be suspected is when high blood pressure (hypertension)
does not respond to medication. Tumors that secrete
adrenaline and noradrenaline can also be found outside the adrenal gland. An adrenal gland scan usually
covers the abdomen, chest, and head.

Precautions

Prognosis
The prognosis for adrenal gland cancer is variable. For localized pheochromocytomas the 5-year
survival rate is 95%. This rate decreases with aggressive tumors that have metastasized. The prognosis for
adrenal cortical cancer is not as good with a 5-year
survival rate of 10-35%.

Prevention
Since so little is known about the cause of adrenal
gland cancer, it is not known if it can be prevented.

Adrenal gland scans are not recommended for
pregnant women because of the potential harm to
the developing fetus. A pregnant woman should discuss with her doctor the risks of the procedure against
the benefits of the information it can provide in evaluating her individual medical situation.
People who have recently undergone tests that use
barium must wait until the barium has been eliminated
from their system in order to obtain accurate results
from the adrenal gland scan.

The adrenal gland scan takes several days. On the
first day, a radiopharmaceutical is injected intravenously into the patient. On the second, third, and
fourth day the patient is positioned under the camera
for imaging. The scanning time each day takes
approximately 30 minutes. It is essential that the
patient remain still during imaging.
Occasionally, the scanning process may involve
fewer than three days, or it may continue several
days longer. The area scanned extends from the pelvis
and lower abdomen to the lower chest. Sometimes the
upper legs, thighs, and head are also included.

KEY TERMS

Adrenal virilism

Adrenal hypofunction see Addison’s disease

KEY TERMS
Adrenal cortex—The outer tissue of the adrenal
gland. It produces a group of chemically related
hormones called corticosteroids that control
mineral and water balance in the body and include
aldosterone and cortisol.
Adrenal medulla—The inner tissue of the adrenal
gland. It produces the hormones adrenaline and
noradrenaline.
Lugol’s solution—A strong iodine solution.

Preparation
For two days before and ten days after the injection of the radiopharmaceutical, patients are given
either Lugol’s solution or potassium iodine. This prevents the thyroid from taking up radioactive iodine
and interfering with the scan.

Aftercare
The patient should not feel any adverse effects of
the test and can resume normal activity immediately.
Follow-up tests that might be ordered include a
nuclear scan of the bones or kidney, a computed
tomography scan (CT) of the adrenals, or an ultrasound of the pelvic area.

Adrenal insufficiency see Addison’s disease

I Adrenal virilism
Definition
Adrenal virilism is the development or premature
development of male secondary sexual characteristics
caused by male sex hormones (androgens) excessively
produced by the adrenal gland. This disorder can
occur before birth and can lead to sexual abnormalities in newborns. It can also occur in girls and women
later in life.

Description
In the normal human body, there are two adrenal
glands. They are small structures that lie on top of the
kidneys. The adrenal glands produce many hormones
that regulate body functions. These hormones include
androgens, or male hormones. Androgens are produced in normal girls and women. Sometimes, one or
both of the adrenal glands becomes enlarged or overactive, producing more than the usual amount of
androgens. The excess androgens create masculine
characteristics.

Risks
The main risk associated with this test is to the
fetus of a pregnant woman.

Normal results
Normal results will show no unusual areas of
hormone secretion and no tumors.

Abnormal results
Abnormal results will show evidence of a tumor
where there is excessive secretion of adrenaline or
noradrenaline. Over 90% of these tumors are in the
abdomen.

Causes and symptoms
In infants and children, adrenal virilism is usually
the result of adrenal gland enlargement that is present
at birth. This is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
The cause is usually a genetic problem that leads to
severe enzyme deficiencies. In rare cases, adrenal
virilism is caused by an adrenal gland tumor. The
tumor can be benign (adrenal adenoma) or cancerous
(adrenal carcinoma). Sometimes virilism is caused by a
type of tumor on a woman’s ovary (arrhenoblastoma).
Newborn girls with adrenal virilism have external
sex organs that seem to be a mixture of male and
female organs (called female pseudohermaphrodism).
Newborn boys with the disorder have enlarged external sex organs, and these organs develop at an abnormally rapid pace.
Children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia begin
growing abnormally fast, but they stop growing earlier
than normal. Later in childhood, they are typically
shorter than normal but have well-developed trunks.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis
Endocrinologists, doctors who specialize in the
diagnosis and treatment of glandular disorders, have
the most expertise to deal with adrenal virilization.
Some doctors who treat disorders of the internal
organs (internists) and doctors who specialize in treating the reproductive system of women (gynecologists)
may also be able to help patients with this disorder.
Diagnosis involves performing many laboratory
tests on blood samples from the patient. These tests
measure the concentration of different hormones.
Different abnormalities of the adrenal gland produce
a different pattern of hormonal abnormalities. These
tests can also help determine if the problem is adrenal
or ovarian. If a tumor is suspected, special x rays may
be done to visualize the tumor in the body. Final
diagnosis may depend on obtaining a tissue sample
from the tumor (biopsy), and examining it under a
microscope in order to verify its characteristics.

KEY TERMS
Glucocorticoid—A hormone produced by the
adrenal gland; this hormone leads to an increase
in blood sugar and creation of sugar molecules by
the liver.
Hydrocortisone—A hormone in the group of glucocorticoid hormones.
Prednisone—A drug that functions as a glucocorticoid hormone.

but there is no cure. If a cancerous tumor has caused
the disorder, patients have a better prognosis if they
have an early stage of cancer that is diagnosed quickly
and has not spread.

Treatment
Adrenal virilism caused by adrenal hyperplasia is
treated with daily doses of a glucocorticoid. Usually
prednisone is the drug of choice, but in infants hydrocortisone is usually given. Laboratory tests are usually
needed from time to time to adjust the dosage. Girls
with pseudohermaphrodism may require surgery to
make their external sex organs appear more normal.
If a tumor is causing the disorder, the treatment will
depend on the type and location of the tumor.
Information about the tumor cell type and the spread
of the tumor is used to decide the best kind of treatment
for a particular patient. If the tumor is cancerous, the
patient will require special treatment depending on how
far the cancer has advanced. Treatment can be a combination of surgery, medications used to kill cancer cells
(chemotherapy), and x rays or other high energy rays
used to kill cancer cells (radiation therapy). Sometimes
the doctor must remove the adrenal gland and the
surrounding tissues. If the tumor is benign, then surgically removing the tumor may be the best option.

Prognosis
Ongoing glucocorticoid treatment usually controls adrenal virilism in cases of adrenal hyperplasia,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

I Adrenalectomy
Definition
Adrenalectomy is the surgical removal of one or
both of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are
paired endocrine glands, one located above each kidney, that produce hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, androgens, estrogens, aldosterone, and
cortisol. Adrenalectomy is usually performed by conventional (open) surgery, but in selected patients surgeons may use laparoscopy. With laparoscopy,
adrenalectomy can be accomplished through four
very small incisions.

Purpose
Adrenalectomy is usually advised for patients
with tumors of the adrenal glands. Adrenal gland
tumors may be malignant or benign, but all typically
excrete excessive amounts of one or more hormones. A
successful procedure will aid in correcting hormone
imbalances, and may also remove cancerous tumors
that can invade other parts of the body. Occasionally,
adrenalectomy may be recommended when hormones

produced by the adrenal glands aggravate another
condition such as breast cancer.

Precautions
The adrenal glands are fed by numerous blood
vessels, so surgeons need to be alert to extensive bleeding during surgery. In addition, the adrenal glands lie
close to one of the body’s major blood vessels (the
vena cava), and to the spleen and the pancreas. The
surgeon needs to remove the gland(s) without damaging any of these important and delicate organs.

Description
Open adrenalectomy
The surgeon may operate from any of four directions, depending on the exact problem and the
patient’s body type.
In the anterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the
abdominal wall. Usually the incision will be horizontal, just under the rib cage. If the surgeon intends to
operate on only one of the adrenal glands, the incision
will run under just the right or the left side of the rib
cage. Sometimes a vertical incision in the middle of the
abdomen provides a better approach, especially if
both adrenal glands are involved.
In the posterior approach, the surgeon cuts into
the back, just beneath the rib cage. If both glands are
to be removed, an incision is made on each side of the
body. This approach is the most direct route to the
adrenal glands, but it does not provide quite as clear a
view of the surrounding structures as the anterior
approach.
In the flank approach, the surgeon cuts into the
patient’s side. This is particularly useful in massively
obese patients. If both glands need to be removed, the
surgeon must remove one gland, repair the surgical
wound, turn the patient onto the other side, and repeat
the entire process.
The last approach involves an incision into the
chest cavity, either with or without part of the incision
into the abdominal cavity. It is used when the surgeon
anticipates a very large tumor, or if the surgeon needs
to examine or remove nearby structures as well.
Laparoscopic adrenalectomy
This technique does not require the surgeon to
open the body cavity. Instead, four small incisions
(about 1/2 in diameter each) are made into a patient’s
flank, just under the rib cage. A laparoscope, which
enables the surgeon to visualize the inside of the

through one of the incisions. The other incisions are
for tubes that carry miniaturized versions of surgical
tools. These tools are designed to be operated by
manipulations that the surgeon makes outside the
body.

Preparation
Most aspects of preparation are the same as in
other major operations. In addition, hormone imbalances are often a major challenge. Whenever possible,
physicians will try to correct hormone imbalances
through medication in the days or weeks before surgery. Adrenal tumors may cause other problems such
as hypertension or inadequate potassium in the blood,
and these problems also should be resolved if possible
before surgery is performed. Therefore, a patient may
take specific medicines for days or weeks before
surgery.
Most adrenal tumors can be imaged very well with
a CT scan or MRI, and benign tumors tend to look
different on these tests than do cancerous tumors.
Surgeons may order a CT scan, MRI, or scintigraphy
(viewing of the location of a tiny amount of radioactive agent) to help locate exactly where the tumor is.
The day before surgery, patients will probably
have an enema to clear the bowels. In patients with
lung problems or clotting problems, physicians may
advise special preparations.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Patients stay in the hospital for various lengths of
time after adrenalectomy. The longest hospital stays
are required for open surgery using an anterior
approach; hospital stays of about three days are indicated for open surgery using the posterior approach or
for laparoscopic adrenalectomy.
The special concern after adrenalectomy is the
patient’s hormone balance. There may be several sets
of lab tests to define hormone problems and monitor
the results of drug treatment. In addition, blood pressure problems and infections are more common after
removal of certain types of adrenal tumors.
As with most open surgery, surgeons are also
concerned about blood clots forming in the legs and
traveling to the lungs (venous thromboembolism),
bowel problems, and postoperative pain. With laparoscopic adrenalectomy, these problems are somewhat
less difficult, but they are still present.

I Adrenocorticotropic
hormone
test
Definition
Adrenocorticotropic hormone test (also known as
an ACTH test or a corticotropin test) measures pituitary gland function.

Purpose
The pituitary gland produces the hormone
ACTH, which stimulates the outer layer of the adrenal
gland (the adrenal cortex). ACTH causes the release of
the hormones hydrocortisone (cortisol), aldosterone,
and androgen. The most important of these hormones
released is cortisol. The ACTH test is used to determine if too much cortisol is being produced (Cushing’s
syndrome) or if not enough cortisol is being produced
(Addison’s disease).

Precautions

Risks
The special risks of adrenalectomy involve major
hormone imbalances, caused by the underlying disease, the surgery, or both.These can include problems
with wound healing itself, blood pressure fluctuations,
and other metabolic problems.
Other risks are typical of many operations.These
include:


bleeding



damage to adjacent organs (spleen, pancreas)



loss of bowel function



blood clots in the lungs



lung problems



surgical infections



pain



extensive scarring

ACTH has diurnal variation, meaning that the
levels of this hormone vary according to the time of
day. The highest levels occur in the morning hours.
Testing for normal secretion, as well as for Cushing’s
disease, may require multiple samples. For sequential
follow-up, a blood sample analyzed for ACTH should
always be drawn at the same time each day.
ACTH can be directly measured by an analyzing
method (immunoassay) in many large laboratories.
However, smaller laboratories are usually not
equipped to perform this test and they may need to
send the blood sample to a larger laboratory. Because
of this delay, results may take several days to obtain.

ACTH production is partly controlled by an area
in the center of the brain (the hypothalamus) and partly
controlled by the level of cortisol in the blood. When
ACTH levels are too high, cortisol production increases
to suppress ACTH release from the pituitary gland. If
ACTH levels are too low, the hypothalamus produces
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to stimulate
the pituitary gland to make more ACTH. ACTH levels
rise in response to stress, emotions, injury, infection,
burns, surgery, and decreased blood pressure.

may be the result of an adrenal gland tumor or enlargement of both adrenal glands due to a pituitary
tumor. The high level of hydrocortisone may be the
result of taking corticosteroid drugs for a long time.
Corticosteroid drugs are widely used for inflammation
in disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory
bowel disease, and asthma.
Addison’s disease
Addison’s disease is a rare disorder in which
symptoms are caused by a deficiency of hydrocortisone and aldosterone. The most common cause of
this disease is an autoimmune disorder. The immune
system normally fights foreign invaders in the body
like bacteria. In an autoimmune disorder, the
immune systems attacks the body. In this case, the
immune system produces antibodies that attack
the adrenal glands. Addison’s disease generally progresses slowly, with symptoms developing gradually
over months or years. However, acute episodes,
called Addisonian crises, are brought on by infection,
injury, or other stresses. Diagnosis is generally made
if the patient fails to respond to an injection of
ACTH, which normally stimulates the secretion of
hydrocortisone.

Preparation
A person’s ACTH level is determined from a
blood sample. The patient must fast from midnight
until the test the next morning. This means that the
patient cannot eat or drink anything after midnight
except water. The patient must also avoid radioisotope scanning tests or recently administered radioisotopes prior to the blood test.

Risks
The risks associated with this test are minimal.
They may include slight bleeding from the location
where the blood was drawn. The patient may feel faint
or lightheaded after the blood is drawn. Sometimes
72

the patient may have an accumulation of blood
under the puncture site (hematoma) after the test.

Normal results
Each laboratory will have its own set of normal
values for this test. The normal values can range from:
Morning (4-8 A.M.) 8-100 pg/mL or 10-80 ng/L (SI
units) Evening (8-10 P.M.) less than 50 pg/mL or less
than 50 ng/L (SI units)

Abnormal results
In Cushing’s syndrome, high levels of ACTH may
be caused by ACTH-producing tumors. These tumors
may be either in the pituitary or in another area (like
tumors from lung cancer or ovarian cancer). Low
ACTH levels may be caused by adrenal enlargement
due to high levels of cortisol and feedback to the
pituitary.
In Addison’s disease, high levels of ACTH may be
caused by adrenal gland diseases. These diseases
decrease adrenal hormones and the pituitary attempts
to increase functioning. Low levels of ACTH may
occur because of decreased pituitary function.

I Adrenoleukodystrophy
Definition
Adrenoleukodystrophy is a rare genetic disease
characterized by a loss of myelin surrounding nerve
cells in the brain and progressive adrenal gland
dysfunction.

Description
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a member of a
group of diseases, leukodystrophies, that cause damage
to the myelin sheath of nerve cells. Approximately one
in 100,000 people is affected by ALD. There are three
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The adult-onset form of the disease, also called
adrenomyeloneuropathy, is milder, progresses slowly,
is usually associated with a normal life span, and
usually appears between ages 21-35. Symptoms may
include progressive stiffness, weakness, or paralysis of
the lower limbs and loss of coordination. Brain function deterioration may also been seen. Women who
are carriers of the disease occasionally experience the
same symptoms, as well as others, including ataxia,
hypertonia (excessive muscle tone), mild peripheral
neuropathy, and urinary problems. The neonatal
form affects both male and female infants and may
produce mental retardation, facial abnormalities, seizures, retinal degeneration, poor muscle tone,
enlarged liver, and adrenal dysfunction. Neonatal
ALD usually progresses rapidly.

Causes and symptoms
The genetic defect in ALD causes a decrease in the
ability to degrade very long chain fatty acids. These
build up in the adrenal glands, brain, plasma, and
fibroblasts. The build-up of very long chain fatty
acids interferes with the ability of the adrenal gland
to convert cholesterol into steroids and causes demyelination of nerves in the white matter of the brain.
Demyelinated nerve cells are unable to function
properly.

KEY TERMS
Amniocentesis—The collection of amniotic fluid
through a needle inserted through the abdomen.
Used to collect fetal cells for genetic analysis.
Ataxia—Loss of coordination of muscular movement.
Hypertonia—Having excessive muscular tone.
Myelin—A layer that encloses nerve cells and some
axons and is made largely of lipids and lipoproteins.
Neuropathy—A disease or abnormality of the peripheral nerves.

Treatment
Treatment for all forms of ALD consists of treating the symptoms and supporting the patient with
physical therapy, psychological counseling, and special education in some cases. There is no cure for this
disease, and there are no drugs that can reverse demyelination of nerve and brain cells. Dietary measures
consist of reducing the intake of foods high in fat,
which are a source of very long chain fatty acids. A
mixture called Lorenzo’s Oil has been shown to reduce
the level of long chain fatty acids if used long term;
however, the rate of myelin loss is unaffected.
Experimental bone marrow transplantation has not
been very effective.

Prognosis
Prognosis for childhood and neonatal ALD
patients is poor because of the progressive myelin
degeneration. Death usually occurs between one and
ten years after onset of symptoms.

Prevention
Since ALD is a genetic disease, prevention is largely limited to genetic counseling and fetal monitoring
through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.
Resources

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made based on observed symptoms, a
biochemical test, and a family history. The biochemical test detects elevated levels of very long chain fatty
acids in samples from amniocentesis, chorionic villi,
plasma, red blood cells, or fibroblasts. A family history may indicate the likelihood of ALD because the
disease is carried on the X-chromosome by the female
lineage of families.

basic forms of ALD: childhood, adult-onset, and
neonatal. The childhood form of the disease is the
classical form and is the most severe. Childhood
ALD is progressive and usually leads to total disability or death. It affects only boys because the genetic
defect is sex-linked (carried on the X chromosome).
Onset usually occurs between ages four and ten and
can include many different symptoms, not all of
which appear together. The most common symptoms
are behavioral problems and poor memory. Other
symptoms frequently seen are loss of vision, seizures,
poorly articulated speech, difficulty swallowing,
deafness, problems with gait and coordination, fatigue, increased skin pigmentation, and progressive
dementia.

Adult respiratory distress syndrome

I Adult
respiratory distress
syndrome

KEY TERMS
Alveoli—The tiny air sacs at the ends of the breathing tubes of the lung where oxygen normally is
taken up by the capillaries to enter the circulation.
Aspiration—The process in which solid food,
liquids, or secretions that normally are swallowed
are, instead, breathed into the lungs.

Definition
Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also
called acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a type
of lung (pulmonary) failure that may result from any
disease that causes large amounts of fluid to collect
in the lungs. ARDS is not itself a specific disease, but a
syndrome, a group of symptoms and signs that
make up one of the most important forms of lung or
respiratory failure. It can develop quite suddenly in
persons whose lungs have been perfectly normal.
Very often ARDS is a true medical emergency. The
basic fault is a breakdown of the barrier, or membrane, that normally keeps fluid from leaking out of
the small blood vessels of the lung into the breathing
sacs (the alveoli).

Capillaries—The smallest arteries which, in the
lung, are located next to the alveoli so that they
can pick up oxygen from inhaled air.
Face mask—The simplest way of delivering a high
level of oxygen to patients with ARDS or other lowoxygen conditions.
Steroids—A class of drugs resembling normal body
substances that often help control inflammation in
the body tissues.
Ventilator—A mechanical device that can take
over the work of breathing for a patient whose
lungs are injured or are starting to heal.

Description
Another name for ARDS is shock lung. Its formal
name is misleading, because children, as well as adults,
may be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood vessels, or capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny
air sacs at the tips of the smallest breathing tubes (the
bronchi). This is the all-important site where oxygen
passes from air that is inhaled to the blood, which
carries it to all parts of the body. Any form of lung
injury that damages this point of contact, called the
alveolo-capillary junction, will allow blood and tissue
fluid to leak into the alveoli, eventually filling them so
that air cannot enter. The result is the type of breathing distress called ARDS. ARDS is one of the major
causes of excess fluid in the lungs, the other being heart
failure.
Along with fluid there is a marked increase in
inflamed cells in the lungs. There also is debris left
over from damaged lung cells, and fibrin, a semisolid material derived from blood in the tissues.
Typically these materials join together with large
molecules in the blood (proteins), to form hyaline
membranes. (These membranes are very prominent
in premature infants who develop respiratory distress
syndrome; it is often called hyaline membrane disease.) If ARDS is very severe or lasts a long time, the
lungs do not heal, but rather become scarred, a process
known as fibrosis. The lack of a normal amount of
oxygen causes the blood vessels of the lung to become
narrower, and in time they, too, may become scarred
and filled with clotted blood. The lungs as a whole
become very ‘‘stiff,’’ and it becomes much harder for
the patient to breathe.
74

Causes and symptoms
A very wide range of diseases or toxic substances,
including some drugs, can cause ARDS. They include:


Breathing in (aspiration) of the stomach contents
when regurgitated, or salt water or fresh water from
nearly drowning.



Inhaling smoke, as in a fire; toxic materials in the air,
such as ammonia or hydrocarbons; or too much
oxygen, which itself can injure the lungs.



Infection by a virus or bacterium, or sepsis, a widespread infection that gets into the blood.



Massive trauma, with severe injury to any part of the
body.



Shock with persistently low blood pressure may not
in itself cause ARDS, but it can be an important
factor.



A blood clotting disorder called disseminated intravascular coagulation, in which blood clots form in
vessels throughout the body, including the lungs.



A large amount of fat entering the circulation and
traveling to the lungs, where it lodges in small blood
vessels, injuring the cells lining the vessel walls.



An overdose of a narcotic drug, a sedative, or, rarely,
aspirin.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), when
blood proteins, called enzymes, pass to the lungs
and injure lung cells.



Severe burn injury.



Injury of the brain, or bleeding into the brain, from
any cause may be a factor in ARDS for reasons that
are not clear. Convulsions also may cause some
cases.

Usually ARDS develops within one to two days of
the original illness or injury. The person begins to take
rapid but shallow breaths. The doctor who listens to
the patient’s chest with a stethoscope may hear
‘‘crackling’’ or wheezing sounds. The low blood oxygen content may cause the skin to appear mottled or
even blue. As fluid continues to fill the breathing sacs,
the patient may have great trouble breathing, take
very rapid breaths, and gasp for air.

Diagnosis
A simple test using a device applied to the ear will
show whether the blood is carrying too little oxygen,
and this can be confirmed by analyzing blood taken
from an artery. The chest x ray may be normal in the
early stages, but, in a short time, fluid will be seen
where it does not belong. The two lungs are about
equally affected. A heart of normal size indicates that
the problem actually is ARDS and not heart failure.
Another way a physician can distinguish between
these two possibilities is to place a catheter into a
vein and advance it into the main artery of the lung.
In this way, the pressure within the pulmonary capillaries can be measured. Pressure within the pulmonary
capillaries is elevated in heart failure, but normal
in ARDS.

Treatment
The three main goals in treating patients with
ARDS are:


To treat whatever injury or disease has caused
ARDS. Examples are: to treat septic infection with
the proper antibiotics, and to reduce the level of
oxygen therapy if ARDS has resulted from a toxic
level of oxygen.



To control the process in the lungs that allows fluid
to leak out of the blood vessels. At present there
is no certain way to achieve this. Certain steroid
hormones have been tried because they can combat
inflammation, but the actual results have been
disappointing.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



To make sure the patient gets enough oxygen until
the lung injury has had time to heal. If oxygen delivered by a face mask is not enough, the patient is
placed on a ventilator, which takes over breathing,
and, through a tube placed in the nose or mouth (or
an incision in the windpipe), forces oxygen into the
lungs. This treatment must be closely supervised, and
the pressure adjusted so that too much oxygen is not
delivered.

Patients with ARDS should be cared for in an
intensive care unit, where experienced staff and all
needed equipment are available. Enough fluid must
be provided, by vein if necessary, to prevent dehydration. Also, the patient’s nutritional state must be maintained, again by vein, if oral intake is not sufficient.

Prognosis
If the patient’s lung injury does not soon begin to
heal, the lack of sufficient oxygen can injure other
organs, such as the kidneys. There always is a risk
that bacterial pneumonia will develop at some point.
Without prompt treatment, as many as 90% of
patients with ARDS can be expected to die. With
modern treatment, however, about half of all patients
will survive. Those who do live usually recover completely, with little or no long-term breathing difficulty.
Lung scarring is a risk after a long period on a ventilator, but it may improve in the months after the
patient is taken off ventilation. Whether a particular
patient will recover depends to a great extent on
whether the primary disease that caused ARDS to
develop in the first place can be effectively treated.

Prevention
The only way to prevent ARDS is to avoid those
diseases and harmful conditions that damage the lung.
For instance, the danger of aspirating stomach contents into the lungs can be avoided by making sure a
patient does not eat shortly before receiving general
anesthesia. If a patient needs oxygen therapy, as low a
level as possible should be given. Any form of lung
infection, or infection anywhere in the body that gets
into the blood, must be treated promptly to avoid the
lung injury that causes ARDS.

I Aging
Definition
Starting at what is commonly called middle age,
operations of the human body begin to be more vulnerable to daily wear and tear; there is a general
decline in physical, and possibly mental, functioning.
In the Western countries, the length of life is often into
the 70s. The upward limit of the life span, however,
can be as high as 120 years. During the latter half of
life, an individual is more prone to have problems with
the various functions of the body and to develop any
number of chronic or fatal diseases. The cardiovascular, digestive, excretory, nervous, reproductive and
urinary systems are particularly affected. The most
common diseases of aging include Alzheimer’s, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, depression, and heart disease.

Description
Human beings reach a peak of growth and development around the time of their mid 20s. Aging is the
normal transition time after that flurry of activity.
Although there are quite a few age-related changes
that tax the body, disability is not necessarily a part
of aging. Health and lifestyle factors together with
the genetic makeup of the individual, and determines
the response to these changes. Body functions that are
most often affected by age include:
76

Causes and symptoms
There are several theories as to why the aging
body loses functioning. It may be that several factors
work together or that one particular factor is at work
more than others in a given individual.


Programmed senescence, or aging clock, theory. The
aging of the cells of each individual is programmed
into the genes, and there is a preset number of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



Genetic theory. Human cells maintain their own seed
of destruction at the level of the chromosomes.



Connective tissue, or cross-linking theory. Changes
in the make-up of the connective tissue alter the
stability of body structures, causing a loss of elasticity and functioning, and leading to symptoms of
aging.





Free-radical theory. The most commonly held theory
of aging, it is based on the fact that ongoing chemical
reactions of the cells produce free radicals. In the
presence of oxygen, these free radicals cause the
cells of the body to break down. As time goes on,
more cells die or lose the ability to function, and the
body soon ceases to function as a whole.
Immunological theory. There are changes in the immune system as it begins to wear out, and the body is
more prone to infections and tissue damage, which
may finally cause death. Also, as the system breaks
down, the body is more apt to have autoimmune
reactions, in which the body’s own cells are mistaken
for foreign material and are destroyed or damaged
by the immune system.

Diagnosis
Many problems can arise due to age-related
changes in the body. Although there is no one test to
be given, a thorough physical exam and a basic blood
screening and blood chemistry panel can point to
areas in need of further attention. When older people
become ill, the first signs of disease are often nonspecific. Further exams should be conducted if any of the
following occur:

KEY TERMS
Antioxidants—Substances that reduce the damage
of the highly reactive free radicals that are the
byproducts of the cells.
Alzheimer’s disease—A condition causing a
decline in brain function that interferes with the
ability to reason and to perform daily activities.
Senescence—Aging.

found under Ayurvedic principles. Keeping one’s
particular constitution in balance is considered
important in maintaining health.

take medications for various complaints. More
women than men use these medications. The most
common drugs used by the elderly are painkillers,
diuretics or water pills, sedatives, cardiac drugs, antibiotics, and mental health drugs.
Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is commonly prescribed to postmenopausal women for
symptoms of aging. It is often used in conjunction
with progesterone. ERT functions to help keep bones
strong, reduce risk of heart disease, restore vaginal
lubrication, and to improve skin elasticity. Evidence
suggests that it may also help maintain mental
functions.

Expected results
Aging is unavoidable, but major physical impairment is not. People can lead a healthy, disability-free
life well through their later years. A well established
support system of family, friends, and health care
providers, together with focus on good nutrition and
lifestyle habits and good stress management, can
prevent disease and lessen the impact of chronic
conditions.

possible rejuvenations in the life of a given cell. When
cells die at a rate faster than they are replaced, organs
do not function properly, and they are soon unable
to maintain the functions necessary for life.

Consumption of a high–quality multivitamin is
recommended. Common nutritional deficiencies connected with aging include B vitamins, vitamins A and
C, folic acid, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, chromium, and trace minerals. Since stomach acids may
be decreased, it is suggested that the use of a powdered
multivitamin formula in gelatin capsules be used, as

this form is the easiest to digest. Such formulas may
also contain enzymes for further help with digestion.
Antioxidants can help to neutralize damage by
the free radical actions thought to contribute to problems of aging. They are also helpful in preventing
and treating cancer and in treating cataracts and
glaucoma. Supplements that serve as antioxidants
include:


Vitamin E, 400–1,000 IUs daily. Protects cell membranes against damage. It shows promise in prevention against heart disease, and Alzheimer’s and
Parkinson’s diseases.



Selenium, 50 mg taken twice daily. Research suggests
that selenium may play a role in reducing the risk of
cancer.



Beta-carotene, 25,000–40,000 IUs daily. May help in
treating cancer, colds and flu, arthritis, and immune
support.



Vitamin C, 1,000–2,000 mg per day. It may cause
diarrhea in large doses. If this occurs, however, all
that is needed is a decrease in the dosage.

Other supplements that are helpful in treating agerelated problems including:


B12/B-complex vitamins, studies show that B12 may
help reduce mental symptoms, such as confusion,
memory loss, and depression.



Coenzyme Q10 may be helpful in treating heart disease, as up to three-quarters cardiac patients have
been found to be lacking in this heart enzyme.
Hormones

The following hormone supplements may be
taken to prevent or to treat various age-related problems. However, caution should be taken before
beginning treatment, and the patient should consult
his or her health care professional.
DHEA improves brain functioning and serves as a
building block for many other important hormones in
the body. It may be helpful in restoring declining
hormone levels and in building up muscle mass,
strengthening the bones, and maintaining a healthy
heart.
Melatonin may be helpful for insomnia. It has also
been used to help fight viruses and bacterial infections,
reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sexual functioning, and to protect against cancer.
Human growth hormone (hGH) has been shown
to regulate blood sugar levels and to stimulate bone,
cartilage, and muscle growth while reducing fat.
78

Herbs
Garlic (Allium sativa) is helpful in preventing
heart disease, as well as improving the tone and texture
of skin. Garlic stimulates liver and digestive system
functions, and also helps in dealing with heart disease
and high blood pressure.
Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus)
supports the adrenal glands and immune functions.
It is believed to be helpful in treating problems related
to stress. Siberian ginseng also increases mental
and physical performance, and may be useful in treating memory loss, chronic fatigue, and immune
dysfunction.
Proanthocyanidins, or PCO, are Pycnogenol,
derived from grape seeds and skin, and from pine
tree bark, and may help in the prevention of cancer
and poor vision.
In Ayurvedic medicine, aging is described as a
process of increased vata, in which there is a tendency
to become thinner, drier, more nervous, more restless,
and more fearful, while having a loss of appetite
as well as sleep. Bananas, almonds, avocados, and
coconuts are some of the foods used in correcting
such conditions. One of the main herbs used for
such conditions is gotu kola (Centella asiatica),
which is used to revitalize the nervous system and
brain cells and to fortify the immune system. Gotu
kola is also used to treat memory loss, anxiety, and
insomnia.
In Chinese medicine, most symptoms of aging are
regarded as symptoms of a yin deficiency. Moistening
foods such as millet, barley soup, tofu, mung beans,
wheat germ, spirulina, potatoes, black sesame seeds,
walnuts, and flax seeds are recommended. Jing tonics
may also be used. These include deer antler, dodder
seeds, processed rehmannia, longevity soup, mussels,
and chicken.

Prevention
Preventive health practices such as healthy diet,
daily exercise, stress management, and control of lifestyle habits such as smoking and drinking, can
lengthen the life span and improve the quality of life
as people age. Exercise can improve the appetite, the
health of the bones, the emotional and mental outlook, and the digestion and circulation.
Drinking plenty of fluids aids in maintaining
healthy skin, good digestion, and proper elimination
of wastes. Up to eight glasses of water should be consumed daily, along with plenty of herbal teas, diluted

Because of a decrease in the sense of taste, older
people often increase their intake of salt, which can
contribute to high blood pressure and nutrient loss.
Use of sugar is also increased. Seaweeds and small
amounts of honey can be used as replacements.
Alcohol, nicotine, and caffeine all have potential
damaging effects, and should be limited or completely
eliminated from consumption.
A diet high in fiber and low in fat is recommended.
Processed foods should be replaced by complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains. If chewing becomes
a problem, there should be an increased intake of
protein drinks, freshly juiced fruits and vegetables,
and creamed cereals.

Patience Paradox

I Agoraphobia
Definition
The word agoraphobia is derived from Greek
words literally meaning ‘‘fear of the marketplace.’’
The term is used to describe an irrational and often
disabling fear of being out in public.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS
Benzodiazepines—A group of tranquilizers often
used to treat anxiety.
Desensitization—A treatment for phobias which
involves exposing the phobic person to the feared
situation. It is often used in conjunction with
relaxation techniques.
Phobia—An intense and irrational fear of a specific
object, activity, or situation.

Description
Agoraphobia is just one type of phobia, or irrational fear. People with phobias feel dread or panic
when they face certain objects, situations, or activities.
People with agoraphobia frequently also experience
panic attacks, but panic attacks, or panic disorder,
are not a requirement for a diagnosis of agoraphobia.
The defining feature of agoraphobia is anxiety about
being in places from which escape might be embarrasing or difficult, or in which help might be unavailable.
The person suffering from agoraphobia usually avoids
the anxiety-provoking situation and may become
totally housebound.

Causes and symptoms
Agoraphobia is the most common type of phobia,
and it is estimated to affect between 5-12% of
Americans within their lifetime. Agoraphobia is
twice as common in women as in men and usually
strikes between the ages of 15-35.
The symptoms of the panic attacks which may
accompany agoraphobia vary from person to person,
and may include trembling, sweating, heart palpitations (a feeling of the heart pounding against the
chest), jitters, fatigue, tingling in the hands and feet,
nausea, a rapid pulse or breathing rate, and a sense of
impending doom.
Agoraphobia and other phobias are thought to be
the result of a number of physical and environmental
factors. For instance, they have been associated with
biochemical imbalances, especially related to certain neurotransmitters (chemical nerve messengers) in the brain.
People who have a panic attack in a given situation
(e.g., a shopping mall) may begin to associate the panic
with that situation and learn to avoid it. According to
some theories, irrational anxiety results from unresolved
emotional conflicts. All of these factors may play a
role to varying extents in different cases of agoraphobia.

Diagnosis
People who suffer from panic attacks should discuss the problem with a physician. The doctor can
diagnose the underlying panic or anxiety disorder
and make sure the symptoms aren’t related to some
other underlying medical condition.
The doctor makes the diagnosis of agoraphobia
based primarily on the patient’s description of his or
her symptoms. The person with agoraphobia experiences anxiety in situations where escape is difficult or
help is unavailable–or in certain situations, such as
being alone. While many people are somewhat apprehensive in these situations, the hallmark of agoraphobia is that a person’s active avoidance of the feared
situation impairs his or her ability to work, socialize,
or otherwise function.

Treatment
Treatment for agoraphobia usually consists of
both medication and psychotherapy. Usually,
patients can benefit from certain antidepressants,
such as amitriptyline (Elavil), or selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, such as paroxetine (Paxil),
fluoxetine (Prozac), or sertraline (Zoloft). In addition, patients may manage panic attacks in progress
with certain tranquilizers called benzodiazepines,
such as alprazolam (Xanax) or clonazepam
(Klonipin).
The mainstay of treatment for agoraphobia and
other phobias is cognitive behavioral therapy. A
specific technique that is often employed is called
desensitization. The patient is gradually exposed to
the situation that usually triggers fear and avoidance,
and, with the help of breathing or relaxation techniques, learns to cope with the situation. This helps
break the mental connection between the situation and
the fear, anxiety, or panic. Patients may also benefit
from psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy,
discussing underlying emotional conflicts with a therapist or support group.

Prognosis
With proper medication and psychotherapy, 90%
of patients will find significant improvement in their
symptoms.

I AIDS
Definition
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is
an infectious disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It was first recognized in the
United States in 1981. AIDS is the advanced form of
infection with the HIV virus, which may not cause
recognizable disease for a long period after the initial
exposure (latency). No vaccine is currently available to
prevent HIV infection. At present, all forms of AIDS
therapy are focused on improving the quality and
length of life for AIDS patients by slowing or halting
the replication of the virus and treating or preventing
infections and cancers that take advantage of a person’s weakened immune system.

Description
AIDS is considered one of the most devastating
public health problems in recent history. In June 2000,
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) reported that 120,223 (includes only those
cases in areas that have confidential HIV reporting)
in the United States are HIV-positive, and 311,701 are
living with AIDS (includes only those cases where vital
status is known). Of these patients, 44% are gay or
bisexual men, 20% are heterosexual intravenous drug
users, and 17% are women. In addition, approximately 1,000-2,000 children are born each year with
HIV infection. The World Health Organization
(WHO) estimates that 33 million adults and 1.3 million children worldwide were living with HIV/AIDS as
of 1999 with 5.4 million being newly infected that year.
Most of these cases are in the developing countries of
Asia and Africa.

Risk factors
AIDS can be transmitted in several ways. The risk
factors for HIV transmission vary according to category:






Sexual contact. Persons at greatest risk are those who
do not practice safe sex, those who are not monogamous, those who participate in anal intercourse, and
those who have sex with a partner with symptoms of
advanced HIV infection and/or other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In the United States and
Europe, most cases of sexually transmitted HIV infection have resulted from homosexual contact, whereas
in Africa, the disease is spread primarily through sexual
intercourse among heterosexuals.
Transmission in pregnancy. High-risk mothers
include women married to bisexual men or men
who have an abnormal blood condition called hemophilia and require blood transfusions, intravenous
drug users, and women living in neighborhoods
with a high rate of HIV infection among heterosexuals. The chances of transmitting the disease to the
child are higher in women in advanced stages of the
disease. Breast feeding increases the risk of transmission by 10-20%. The use of zidovudine (AZT) during
pregnancy, however, can decrease the risk of transmission to the baby.
Exposure to contaminated blood or blood products.
With the introduction of blood product screening in
the mid-1980s, the incidence of HIV transmission in
blood transfusions has dropped to one in every 100,000

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



Needle sticks among health care professionals.
Present studies indicate that the risk of HIV transmission by a needle stick is about one in 250. This
rate can be decreased if the injured worker is given
AZT, an anti-retroviral medication, in combination
with other medication.

HIV is not transmitted by handshakes or other
casual non-sexual contact, coughing or sneezing, or by
bloodsucking insects such as mosquitoes.
AIDS in women
AIDS in women is a serious public health concern.
Women exposed to HIV infection through heterosexual contact are the most rapidly growing risk
group in the United States population. The percentage
of AIDS cases diagnosed in women has risen from 7%
in 1985 to 23% in 1999. Women diagnosed with AIDS
may not live as long as men, although the reasons for
this finding are unclear.
AIDS in children
Since AIDS can be transmitted from an infected
mother to the child during pregnancy, during the birth
process, or through breast milk, all infants born to
HIV-positive mothers are a high-risk group. As of
2000, it was estimated that 87% of HIV-positive
women are of childbearing age; 41% of them are
drug abusers. Between 15-30% of children born to
HIV-positive women will be infected with the virus.
AIDS is one of the 10 leading causes of death in
children between one and four years of age. The interval between exposure to HIV and the development of
AIDS is shorter in children than in adults. Infants
infected with HIV have a 20-30% chance of developing AIDS within a year and dying before age three. In
the remainder, AIDS progresses more slowly; the
average child patient survives to seven years of age.
Some survive into early adolescence.

Causes and symptoms
Because HIV destroys immune system cells, AIDS
is a disease that can affect any of the body’s major
organ systems. HIV attacks the body through three
disease processes: immunodeficiency, autoimmunity,
and nervous system dysfunction.
81

transfused. With respect to HIV transmission among
drug abusers, risk increases with the duration of using
injections, the frequency of needle sharing, the number of persons who share a needle, and the number of
AIDS cases in the local population.

Immunodeficiency describes the condition in
which the body’s immune response is damaged, weakened, or is not functioning properly. In AIDS, immunodeficiency results from the way that the virus binds
to a protein called CD4, which is primarily found on
the surface of certain subtypes of white blood cells
called helper T cells or CD4 cells. After the virus has
attached to the CD4 receptor, the virus-CD4 complex
refolds to uncover another receptor called a chemokine receptor that helps to mediate entry of the virus
into the cell. One chemokine receptor in particular,
CCR5, has gotten recent attention after studies
showed that defects in its structure (caused by genetic
mutations) cause the progression of AIDS to be prevented or slowed. Scientists hope that this discovery
will lead to the development of drugs that trigger an
artificial mutation of the CCR5 gene or target the
CCR5 receptor.

functioning of the remaining CD4 cells. Because the
immune system cells are destroyed, many different
types of infections and cancers that take advantage
of a person’s weakened immune system (opportunistic) can develop.

Once HIV has entered the cell, it can replicate
intracellularly and kill the cell in ways that are still
not completely understood. In addition to killing some
lymphocytes directly, the AIDS virus disrupts the

Researchers do not know precisely how HIV
attacks the nervous system since the virus can cause
damage without infecting nerve cells directly. One
theory is that, once infected with HIV, one type of

82

Autoimmunity is a condition in which the body’s
immune system produces antibodies that work against
its own cells. Antibodies are specific proteins produced in response to exposure to a specific, usually
foreign, protein or particle called an antigen. In this
case, the body produces antibodies that bind to blood
platelets that are necessary for proper blood clotting
and tissue repair. Once bound, the antibodies mark the
platelets for removal from the body, and they are
filtered out by the spleen. Some AIDS patients develop
a disorder, called immune-related thrombocytopenia
purpura (ITP), in which the number of blood platelets
drops to abnormally low levels.

KEY TERMS
Acute retroviral syndrome—A group of symptoms
resembling mononucleosis that often are the first
sign of HIV infection in 50-70% of all patients and
45-90% of women.

Autoimmunity—A condition in which the body’s

CD4—A type of protein molecule in human blood,
sometimes called the T4 antigen, that is present on
the surface of 65% of immune cells. The HIV virus
infects cells with CD4 surface proteins, and as a
result, depletes the number of T cells, B cells, natural
killer cells, and monocytes in the patient’s blood.

Antigen—Any substance that stimulates the body to
produce antibody.

AIDS

Most of the damage to an AIDS patient’s immune
system is done by the virus’ destruction of CD4+
lymphocytes.
Chemokine receptor—A receptor on the surface of
some types of immune cells that helps to mediate
entry of HIV into the cell.
Hairy leukoplakia of the tongue—A white area of
diseased tissue on the tongue that may be flat or
slightly raised. It is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus
and is an important diagnostic sign of AIDS.
Hemophilia—Any of several hereditary blood coagulation disorders occurring almost exclusively in
males. Because blood does not clot properly, even
minor injuries can cause significant blood loss that
may require a blood transfusion, with its associated
minor risk of infection.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—A transmissible retrovirus that causes AIDS in humans. Two
forms of HIV are now recognized: HIV-1, which
causes most cases of AIDS in Europe, North and
South America, and most parts of Africa; and HIV-2,
which is chiefly found in West African patients.
HIV-2, discovered in 1986, appears to be less virulent
than HIV-1 and may also have a longer latency period.
Immunodeficient—A condition in which the body’s
immune response is damaged, weakened, or is not
functioning properly.
Kaposi’s sarcoma—A cancer of the connective tissue
that produces painless purplish red (in people with
light skin) or brown (in people with dark skin) blotches
on the skin. It is a major diagnostic marker of AIDS.
Latent period—Also called incubation period, the
time between infection with a disease-causing
agent and the development of disease.
Lymphocyte—A type of white blood cell that is important in the formation of antibodies and that can be used
to monitor the health of AIDS patients.
Lymphoma—A cancerous tumor in the lymphatic
system that is associated with a poor prognosis in
AIDS patients.
Macrophage—A large white blood cell, found primarily in the bloodstream and connective tissue, that
helps the body fight off infections by ingesting the
disease-causing organism. HIV can infect and kill
macrophages.
Monocyte—A large white blood cell that is formed
in the bone marrow and spleen. About 4% of the
white blood cells in normal adults are monocytes.

Mycobacterium avium (MAC) infection—A type
of opportunistic infection that occurs in about 40%
of AIDS patients and is regarded as an AIDS-defining
disease.
Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors—
The newest class of antiretroviral drugs that work
by inhibiting the reverse transcriptase enzyme
necessary for HIV replication.
Nucleoside analogues—The first group of effective
anti-retroviral medications. They work by interfering
with the AIDS virus’ synthesis of DNA.
Opportunistic infection—An infection by organisms
that usually don’t cause infection in people whose
immune systems are working normally.
Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL)—A
condition in which HIV continues to produce
chronic painless swellings in the lymph nodes during
the latency period.
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP)—An
opportunistic infection caused by a fungus that is a
major cause of death in patients with late-stage
AIDS.
Progressive
multifocal
leukoencephalopathy
(PML)—A disease caused by a virus that destroys
white matter in localized areas of the brain. It is
regarded as an AIDS-defining illness.
Protease inhibitors—The second major category of
drug used to treat AIDS that works by suppressing the
replication of the HIV virus.
Protozoan—A single-celled, usually microscopic
organism that is eukaryotic and, therefore, different
from bacteria (prokaryotic).
Retrovirus—A virus that contains a unique enzyme
called reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate
within new host cells.

cheeks.
Viremia—The measurable presence of virus in the
bloodstream that is a characteristic of acute retroviral
syndrome.
Wasting syndrome—A progressive loss of weight
and muscle tissue caused by the AIDS virus.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The course of AIDS generally progresses through
three stages, although not all patients will follow this
progression precisely:
Acute retroviral syndrome
Acute retroviral syndrome is a term used to
describe a group of symptoms that can resemble
mononucleosis and that may be the first sign of HIV
infection in 50-70% of all patients and 45-90% of
women. Most patients are not recognized as infected
during this phase and may not seek medical attention.
The symptoms may include fever, fatigue, muscle
aches, loss of appetite, digestive disturbances, weight
loss, skin rashes, headache, and chronically swollen
lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy). Approximately 2533% of patients will experience a form of meningitis
during this phase in which the membranes that cover
the brain and spinal cord become inflamed. Acute
retroviral syndrome develops between one and six
weeks after infection and lasts for two to three
weeks. Blood tests during this period will indicate the
presence of virus (viremia) and the appearance of the
viral p24 antigen in the blood.

or ulcers, or other infections of the mouth; diarrhea
and other gastrointestinal symptoms that cause malnutrition and weight loss; diseases of the lungs and
kidneys; and degeneration of the nerve fibers in the
arms and legs. HIV infection of the nervous system
leads to general loss of strength, loss of reflexes, and
feelings of numbness or burning sensations in the feet
or lower legs.
Late-stage disease (AIDS)
AIDS is usually marked by a very low number of
CD4+ lymphocytes, followed by a rise in the frequency of opportunistic infections and cancers.
Doctors monitor the number and proportion of
CD4+ lymphocytes in the patient’s blood in order to
assess the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of different medications. About 10% of infected
individuals never progress to this overt stage of the
disease and are referred to as nonprogressors.
OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS. Once the patient’s
CD4+ lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/mm 3,
he or she is at risk for a variety of opportunistic infections. The infectious organisms may include the
following:


Fungi. The most common fungal disease associated
with AIDS is Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).
PCP is the immediate cause of death in 15-20% of
AIDS patients. It is an important measure of a
patient’s prognosis. Other fungal infections include
a yeast infection of the mouth (candidiasis or thrush)
and cryptococcal meningitis.



Protozoa. Toxoplasmosis is a common opportunistic
infection in AIDS patients that is caused by a protozoan. Other diseases in this category include isoporiasis and cryptosporidiosis.



Mycobacteria. AIDS patients may develop tuberculosis or MAC infections. MAC infections are caused
by Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, and occur in
about 40% of AIDS patients. It is rare until CD4+
counts falls below 50 cells/mm3.



Bacteria. AIDS patients are likely to develop bacterial infections of the skin and digestive tract.



Viruses. AIDS patients are highly vulnerable to cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV),
varicella zoster virus (VZV), and Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) infections. Another virus, JC virus, causes
progressive destruction of brain tissue in the brain
stem, cerebrum, and cerebellum (multifocal leukoencephalopathy or PML), which is regarded as an
AIDS-defining illness by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.

Latency period
After the HIV virus enters a patient’s lymph nodes
during the acute retroviral syndrome stage, the disease
becomes latent for as many as 10 years or more before
symptoms of advanced disease develop. During
latency, the virus continues to replicate in the lymph
nodes, where it may cause one or more of the following
conditions:
PERSISTENT GENERALIZED LYMPHADENOPATHY
(PGL). Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, or

PGL, is a condition in which HIV continues to produce chronic painless swellings in the lymph nodes
during the latency period. The lymph nodes that are
most frequently affected by PGL are those in the areas
of the neck, jaw, groin, and armpits. PGL affects
between 50-70% of patients during latency.
CONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS. Many patients will
develop low-grade fevers, chronic fatigue, and general
weakness. HIV may also cause a combination of food
malabsorption, loss of appetite, and increased metabolism that contribute to the so-called AIDS wasting
or wasting syndrome.
OTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS. At any time during the
course of HIV infection, patients may suffer from a
yeast infection in the mouth called thrush, open sores

immune system cell, called a macrophage, begins to
release a toxin that harms the nervous system.

AIDS

AIDS DEMENTIA COMPLEX AND NEUROLOGIC
COMPLICATIONS. AIDS dementia complex is usually

a late complication of the disease. It is unclear whether
it is caused by the direct effects of the virus on the
brain or by intermediate causes. AIDS dementia complex is marked by loss of reasoning ability, loss of
memory, inability to concentrate, apathy and loss of
initiative, and unsteadiness or weakness in walking.
Some patients also develop seizures. There are no
specific treatments for AIDS dementia complex.
MUSCULOSKELETAL COMPLICATIONS. Patients in
late-stage AIDS may develop inflammations of the
muscles, particularly in the hip area, and may have
arthritis-like pains in the joints.
ORAL SYMPTOMS. In addition to thrush and painful ulcers in the mouth, patients may develop a condition called hairy leukoplakia of the tongue. This
condition is also regarded by the CDC as an indicator
of AIDS. Hairy leukoplakia is a white area of diseased
tissue on the tongue that may be flat or slightly raised.
It is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.
AIDS-RELATED CANCERS. Patients with late-stage

AIDS may develop Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), a skin
tumor that primarily affects homosexual men. KS is
the most common AIDS-related malignancy. It is
characterized by reddish-purple blotches or patches
(brownish in African-Americans) on the skin or in
the mouth. About 40% of patients with KS develop
symptoms in the digestive tract or lungs. KS may be
caused by a herpes virus-like sexually transmitted disease agent rather than HIV.
The second most common form of cancer in AIDS
patients is a tumor of the lymphatic system (lymphoma). AIDS-related lymphomas often affect the
central nervous system and develop very aggressively.
Invasive cancer of the cervix (related to certain
types of human papilloma virus [HPV]) is an important diagnostic marker of AIDS in women.
While incidence of AIDS-defining cancers such as
Kaposi’s sarcoma and cervical cancer have decreased
since increase use of antiretroviral therapy, other cancers has increased in AIDS patients. People with HIV
has shown higher incidence of lung cancer, head and
neck cancers, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, melanoma, and
anorectal cancer from 1992 to 2002.

Diagnosis
Because HIV infection produces such a wide
range of symptoms, the CDC has drawn up a list
of 34 conditions regarded as defining AIDS. The
86

physician will use the CDC list to decide whether the
patient falls into one of these three groups:


definitive diagnoses with or without laboratory evidence of HIV infection



definitive diagnoses with laboratory evidence of HIV
infection



presumptive diagnoses with laboratory evidence of
HIV infection.
Physical findings

Almost all the symptoms of AIDS can occur with
other diseases. The general physical examination may
range from normal findings to symptoms that are
closely associated with AIDS. These symptoms are
hairy leukoplakia of the tongue and Kaposi’s sarcoma. When the doctor examines the patient, he or
she will look for the overall pattern of symptoms
rather than any one finding.
Laboratory tests for HIV infection
BLOOD TESTS (SEROLOGY). The first blood test
for AIDS was developed in 1985. At present, patients
who are being tested for HIV infection are usually
given an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) test for the presence of HIV antibody in
their blood. Positive ELISA results are then tested
with a Western blot or immunofluorescence (IFA)
assay for confirmation. The combination of the
ELISA and Western blot tests is more than 99.9%
accurate in detecting HIV infection within four to
eight weeks following exposure. The polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) test can be used to detect the
presence of viral nucleic acids in the very small number
of HIV patients who have false-negative results on the
ELISA and Western blot tests. These tests are also
used to detect viruses and bacterium other than HIV
and AIDS.
OTHER LABORATORY TESTS. In addition to diagnostic blood tests, there are other blood tests that are
used to track the course of AIDS in patients that have
already been diagnosed. These include blood counts,
viral load tests, p24 antigen assays, and measurements
of 2-microglobulin ( 2M).

Doctors will use a wide variety of tests to diagnose
the presence of opportunistic infections, cancers, or
other disease conditions in AIDS patients. Tissue

Protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors can be effective against HIV strains that have developed resistance to nucleoside analogues, and are often used in
combination with them. These compounds include
saquinavir, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and lopinavir..



Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. This
is a new class of antiretroviral agents. Three are
available, nevirapine, which was approved first, delavirdine and efavirin.



Fusion inhibitors, the newest class of antiretrovirals.
They block specific proteins on the surface of the
virus or the CD4 cell. These proteins help the virus
gain entry into the cell.The only FDA approved
fusion inhibitor as of spring 2004 was enfuvirtide.

Diagnosis in children
Diagnostic blood testing in children older than 18
months is similar to adult testing, with ELISA screening confirmed by Western blot. Younger infants can
be diagnosed by direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR
testing, and p24 antigen testing.
In terms of symptoms, children are less likely than
adults to have an early acute syndrome. They are,
however, likely to have delayed growth, a history of
frequent illness, recurrent ear infections, a low blood
cell count, failure to gain weight, and unexplained
fevers. Children with AIDS are more likely to develop
bacterial infections, inflammation of the lungs, and
AIDS-related brain disorders than are HIV-positive
adults.

Treatment
Treatment for AIDS covers four considerations:
TREATMENT OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS AND
MALIGNANCIES. Most AIDS patients require complex

long-term treatment with medications for infectious
diseases. This treatment is often complicated by the
development of resistance in the disease organisms.
AIDS-related malignancies in the central nervous system are usually treated with radiation therapy.
Cancers elsewhere in the body are treated with
chemotherapy.
PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT FOR OPPORTUNISTIC
INFECTIONS. Prophylactic treatment is treatment that

is given to prevent disease. AIDS patients with a history of Pneumocystis pneumonia; with CD4+ counts
below 200 cells/mm3 or 14% of lymphocytes; weight
loss; or thrush should be given prophylactic medications. The three drugs given are trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, dapsone, or pentamidine in aerosol
form.
ANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENT. In

recent years
researchers have developed drugs that suppress HIV
replication, as distinct from treating its effects on the
body. These drugs fall into four classes:


Nucleotide analogues. These drugs work by interfering with the action of HIV reverse transcriptase
inside infected cells, thus ending the virus’ replication
process. These drugs include zidovudine (sometimes
called azidothymidine or AZT), didanosine (ddI),

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment guidelines for these agents are in constant change as new medications are developed and
introduced. Two principles currently guide doctors in
working out drug regimens for AIDS patients: using
combinations of drugs rather than one medication
alone; and basing treatment decisions on the results
of the patient’s viral load tests.
STIMULATION OF BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION.

Because many patients with AIDS suffer from abnormally low levels of both red and white blood cells,
they may be given medications to stimulate blood cell
production. Epoetin alfa (erythropoietin) may be
given to anemic patients. Patients with low white
blood cell counts may be given filgrastim or
sargramostim.
Treatment in women
Treatment of pregnant women with HIV is particularly important in that anti-retroviral therapy
has been shown to reduce transmission to the infant
by 65%.

Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for AIDS can be grouped
into two categories: those intended to help the immune
system and those aimed at pain control. Treatments
that may enhance the function of the immune system
include Chinese herbal medicine and western herbal
medicine, macrobiotic and other special diets, guided
imagery and creative visualization, homeopathy, and
vitamin therapy. Pain control therapies include hydrotherapy, reiki, acupuncture, meditation, chiropractic
treatments, and therapeutic massage. Alternative

nervous system, and wasting of the muscles. Urine and
stool samples are used to diagnose infections caused
by parasites. AIDS patients are also given blood tests
for syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases.

AIDS tests

therapies can also be used to help with side effects of
the medications used in the treatment of AIDS.

Prognosis
At the present time, there is no cure for AIDS.
Treatment stresses aggressive combination drug
therapy for those patients with access to the expensive medications and who tolerate them adequately.
The use of these multi-drug therapies has significantly reduced the numbers of deaths, in this country,
resulting from AIDS. The data is still inconclusive,
but the potential exists to possibly prolong life
indefinitely using these and other drug therapies to
boost the immune system, keep the virus from replicating, and ward off opportunistic infections and
malignancies.
Prognosis after the latency period depends on the
patient’s specific symptoms and the organ systems
affected by the disease. Patients with AIDS-related
lymphomas of the central nervous system die within
two to three months of diagnosis; those with systemic
lymphomas may survive for eight to ten months.



If someone suspects HIV infection, he or she
should be tested for HIV. If treated aggressively
and early, the development of AIDS may be postponed indefinitely. If HIV infection is confirmed, it
is also vital to let sexual partners know so that they
can be tested and, if necessary, receive medical
attention.

Prevention
As of 2005, there was no vaccine effective against
AIDS. Several vaccines are currently being investigated, however, both to prevent initial HIV infection
and as a therapeutic treatment to prevent HIV from
progressing to full-blown AIDS.
In the meantime, there are many things that can
be done to prevent the spread of AIDS:


Being monogamous and practice safe sex.
Individuals must be instructed in the proper use of
condoms and urged to practice safe sex. Besides
avoiding the risk of HIV infection, condoms are
successful in preventing other sexually transmitted
diseases and unwanted pregnancies. Before engaging
in a sexual relationship with someone, getting tested
for HIV infection is recommended.



Avoiding needle sharing among intravenous drug
users.



Although blood and blood products are carefully
monitored, those individuals who are planning to
undergo major surgery may wish to donate blood
ahead of time to prevent a risk of infection from a
blood transfusion.



Healthcare professionals must take all necessary precautions by wearing gloves and masks when handling body fluids and preventing needle-stick injuries.

AIDS serology see AIDS tests

I AIDS tests
Definition
AIDS tests, short for acquired immunodeficiency
syndrome tests, cover a number of different procedures used in the diagnosis and treatment of HIV
patients. These tests sometimes are called AIDS
serology tests. Serology is the branch of immunology
that deals with the contents and characteristics of
blood serum. Serum is the clear light yellow part
of blood that remains liquid when blood cells form
a clot. AIDS serology evaluates the presence of
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in
blood serum and its effects on each patient’s immune
system.

Purpose
AIDS serology serves several different purposes.
Some AIDS tests are used to diagnose patients or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

AIDS tests

confirm a diagnosis; others are used to measure the
progression of the disease or the effectiveness of specific treatment regimens. Some AIDS tests also can be
used to screen blood donations for safe use in
transfusions.
In order to understand the different purposes
of the blood tests used with AIDS patients, it is helpful to understand how HIV infection affects human
blood and the immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that
enters the blood stream of a new host in the following
ways:


by sexual contact



by contact with infected body fluids (such as blood
and urine)



by transmission during pregnancy, or



through transfusion of infected blood products

A retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique
enzyme called reverse transcriptase that allows it to
replicate within new host cells. The virus binds to a
protein called CD4, which is found on the surface of
certain subtypes of white blood cells, including helper
T cells, macrophages, and monocytes. Once HIV
enters the cell, it can replicate and kill the cell in
ways that are still not completely understood. In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly, the AIDS
virus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CD4
cells. CD4 cells ordinarily produce a substance called
interleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulates other cells
(T cells and B cells) in the human immune system
to respond to infections. Without the IL-2, T cells do
not reproduce as they normally would in response to the
HIV virus, and B cells are not stimulated to respond
to the infection.

Precautions
In some states such as New York, a signed consent
form is needed in order to administer an AIDS test. As
with all blood tests, healthcare professionals should
always wear latex gloves and avoid being pricked by
the needle used in drawing blood for the tests. It may
be difficult to get blood from a habitual intravenous
drug user due to collapsed veins.

Description
Diagnostic tests
Diagnostic blood tests for AIDS usually are given
to persons in high-risk populations who may have
been exposed to HIV or who have the early symptoms
of AIDS. Most persons infected with HIV will develop
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Corporation (New York). Reproduced by permission.)

a detectable level of antibody within three months of
infection. The condition of testing positive for HIV
antibody in the blood is called seroconversion, and
persons who have become HIV-positive are called
seroconverters.
It is possible to diagnose HIV infection by isolating the virus itself from a blood sample or by demonstrating the presence of HIV antigen in the blood.
Viral culture, however, is expensive, not widely available, and slow—it takes 28 days to complete the viral
culture test. More common are blood tests that work
by detecting the presence of antibodies to the HIV
virus. These tests are inexpensive, widely available,
and accurate in detecting 99.9% of AIDS infections
when used in combination to screen patients and
confirm diagnoses.
ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA).

This type of blood test is used to screen blood for
transfusions as well as diagnose patients. An ELISA
test for HIV works by attaching HIV antigens to a
plastic well or beads. A sample of the patient’s blood
serum is added, and excess proteins are removed.
A second antibody coupled to an enzyme is added,
followed by addition of a substance that will cause
the enzyme to react by forming a color. An instrument called a spectrophotometer can measure the
color. The name of the test is derived from the use
of the enzyme that is coupled or linked to the second
antibody.

AIDS tests

KEY TERMS
Antibody—A protein in the blood that identifies and
helps remove disease organisms or their toxins.
Antibodies are secreted by B cells. AIDS diagnostic
tests work by demonstrating the presence of HIV
antibody in the patient’s blood.

South America, and most parts of Africa; and
HIV-2, which is chiefly found in West African
patients. HIV-2, discovered in 1986, appears to be
less virulent than HIV-1, but also may have a longer
latency period.

Antigen—Any substance that stimulates the body to
produce antibodies.
B cell—A type of white blood cell derived from bone
marrow. B cells are sometimes called B lymphocytes. They secrete antibody and have a number of
other complex functions within the human immune
system.

Immunofluorescent assay (IFA)—A blood test sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead of using
the Western blotting. In an IFA test, HIV antigen is
mixed with a fluorescent compound and then with a
sample of the patient’s blood. If HIV antibody is
present, the mixture will fluoresce when examined
under ultraviolet light.
Lymphocyte—A type of white blood cell that is
important in the formation of antibodies. Doctors
can monitor the health of AIDS patients by measuring the number or proportion of certain types of
lymphocytes in the patient’s blood.
Macrophage—A large white blood cell, found primarily in the bloodstream and connective tissue, that
helps the body fight off infections by ingesting the
disease organism. HIV can infect and kill
macrophages.

CD4—A type of protein molecule in human blood
that is present on the surface of 65% of human
T cells. CD4 is a receptor for the HIV virus. When
the HIV virus infects cells with CD4 surface proteins, it
depletes the number of T cells, B cells, natural killer
cells, and monocytes in the patient’s blood. Most of
the damage to an AIDS patient’s immune system is
done by the virus’ destruction of CD4+ lymphocytes.
CD4 is sometimes called the T4 antigen.
Complete blood count (CBC)—A routine analysis
performed on a sample of blood taken from the
patient’s vein with a needle and vacuum tube. The
measurements taken in a CBC include a white blood
cell count, a red blood cell count, the red cell distribution width, the hematocrit (ratio of the volume
of the red blood cells to the blood volume), and the
amount of hemoglobin (the blood protein that carries
oxygen). CBCs are a routine blood test used for many
medical reasons, not only for AIDS patients. They
can help the doctor determine if a patient is in
advanced stages of the disease.
Electrophoresis—A method of separating complex
protein molecules suspended in a gel by running an
electric current through the gel.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)—A
diagnostic blood test used to screen patients for
AIDS or other viruses. The patient’s blood is mixed
with antigen attached to a plastic tube or bead surface. A sample of the patient’s blood serum is added,
and excess proteins are removed. A second antibody
coupled to an enzyme is added, followed by a chemical that will cause a color reaction that can be
measured by a special instrument.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—A transmissible retrovirus that causes AIDS in humans. Two
forms of HIV are now recognized: HIV-1, which
causes most cases of AIDS in Europe, North and

90

Monocyte—A large white blood cell that is formed
in the bone marrow and spleen. About 4% of the
white blood cells in normal adults are monocytes.
Opportunistic infection—An infection that develops
only when a person’s immune system is weakened,
as happens to AIDS patients.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)—A test performed
to evaluate false-negative results to the ELISA and
Western blot tests. In PCR testing, numerous copies
of a gene are made by separating the two strands of
DNA containing the gene segment, marking its location, using DNA polymerase to make a copy, and
then continuously replicating the copies. The amplification of gene sequences that are associated with
HIV allows for detection of the virus by this method.
Retrovirus—A virus that contains a unique enzyme
called reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate
within new host cells.
Seroconversion—The change from HIV- negative to
HIV-positive status during blood testing. Persons
who are HIV-positive are called seroconverters.
Serology—The analysis of the contents and properties of blood serum.
Serum—The part of human blood that remains liquid
when blood cells form a clot. Human blood serum is
clear light yellow in color.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Viral load test—A new blood test for monitoring the
speed of HIV replication in AIDS patients. The viral
load test is based on PCR techniques and supplements the CD4+ cell count tests.
Western blot—A technique developed in 1979 that
is used to confirm ELISA results. HIV antigen is purified by electrophoresis and attached by blotting to a
nylon or nitrocellulose filter. The patient’s serum is

The latest generation of ELISA tests are 99.5%
sensitive to HIV. Occasionally, the ELISA test will be
positive for a patient without symptoms of AIDS from
a low-risk group. Because this result is likely to be a
false-positive, the ELISA must be repeated on the same
sample of the patient’s blood. If the second ELISA is
positive, the result should be confirmed by the
Western blot test.
WESTERN BLOT (IMMUNOBLOT). The Western blot
or immunoblot test is used as a reference procedure to
confirm the diagnosis of AIDS. In Western blot testing, HIV antigen is purified by electrophoresis (large
protein molecules are suspended in a gel and separated
from one another by running an electric current
through the gel). The HIV antigens are attached by
blotting to a nylon or nitrocellulose filter. The
patient’s serum is reacted against the filter, followed
by treatment with developing chemicals that allow
HIV antibody to show up as a colored patch or blot.
A commercially produced Western blot test for HIV-1
is now available. It consists of a prefabricated
strip that is incubated with a sample of the patient’s
blood serum and the developing chemicals. About
nine different HIV-1 proteins can be detected in
the blots.

When used in combination with ELISA testing,
Western blot testing is 99.9% specific. It can, however,
yield false negatives in patients with very early HIV
infection and in those infected by HIV-2. In some
patients the Western blot yields indeterminate results.
IMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ASSAY (IFA). This method
is sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead of
Western blotting. An IFA test detects the presence of
HIV antibody in a sample of the patient’s serum by
mixing HIV antigen with a fluorescent chemical, adding the blood sample, and observing the reaction
under a microscope with ultraviolet light.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

reacted against the filter, followed by treatment with
developing chemicals that allow HIV antibody to
show up as a colored patch or blot. If the patient is
HIV-positive, there will be stripes at specific locations for two or more viral proteins. A negative result
is blank.
WBC differential—A white blood cell count in
which the technician classifies the different white
blood cells by type as well as calculating the
number of each type. A WBC differential is necessary to calculate the absolute CD4+ lymphocyte
count.

POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR). This test is
used to evaluate the very small number of AIDS
patients with false-negative ELISA and Western blot
tests. These patients are sometimes called antibodynegative asymptomatic (without symptoms) carriers,
because they do not have any symptoms of AIDS and
there is no detectable quantity of antibody in the blood
serum. Antibody-negative asymptomatic carriers may
be responsible for the very low ongoing risk of HIV
infection transmitted by blood transfusions. It is estimated that the risk is between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in
100,000 units of transfused blood.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can
measure the presence of viral nucleic acids in the
patient’s blood even when there is no detectable antibody to HIV. This test works by amplifying the presence of HIV nucleic acids in a blood sample.
Numerous copies of a gene are made by separating
the two strands of DNA containing the gene segment,
marking its location, using DNA polymerase to make
a copy, and then continuously replicating the copies. It
is questionable whether PCR will replace Western
blotting as the method of confirming AIDS diagnoses.
Although PCR can detect the low number of persons
(1%) with HIV infections that have not yet generated
an antibody response to the virus, the overwhelming
majority of infected persons will be detected by ELISA
screening within one to three months of infection.
In addition, PCR testing is based on present knowledge of the genetic sequences in HIV. Since the virus
is continually generating new variants, PCR testing
could yield a false negative in patients with these
new variants. In 2004, researchers reported on a new
test that was more sensitive to HIV, detecting the
infection in as little as 12 days after infection.
However, the manufacturer was still seeking FDA
approval for the test, which would cost about the
same as PCR testing.
91

AIDS tests

T cells—Lymphocytes that originate in the thymus
gland. T cells regulate the immune system’s response
to infections, including HIV. CD4 lymphocytes are a
subset of T lymphocytes.

AIDS tests

In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved an HIV home testing kit. The kit
contained multiple components, including material
for specimen collection, a mailing envelope to send
the specimen to a laboratory for analysis, and provides
pre- and post-test counseling. It uses a finger prick
process for blood collection. Other tests have been in
development that would allow patients to monitor
their own therapy in the home without sending out
for results.

the patient’s white blood cell count (WBC) by the
percentage of lymphocytes among the white blood
cells, and multiplying the result by the percentage
of lymphocytes bearing the CD4+ marker. An absolute count below 200-300 CD+4 lymphocytes
in 1 cubic millimeter (mm3) of blood indicates that
the patient is vulnerable to some opportunistic
infections.


Prognostic tests
Blood tests to evaluate patients already diagnosed
with HIV infection are as important as the diagnostic
tests. Because AIDS has a long latency period, some
persons may be infected with the virus for 10 years or
longer before they develop symptoms of AIDS. These
patients are sometimes called antibody-positive
asymptomatic carriers. Prognostic tests also help
drug researchers evaluate the usefulness of new medications in treating AIDS.
BLOOD CELL COUNTS. Doctors can measure the
number or proportion of certain types of cells in an
AIDS patient’s blood to see whether and how rapidly
the disease is progressing, or whether certain treatments are helping the patient. These cell count tests
include:




Complete blood count (CBC). A CBC is a routine
analysis performed on a sample of blood taken
from the patient’s vein with a needle and vacuum
tube. The measurements taken in a CBC include a
white blood cell count (WBC), a red blood cell count
(RBC), the red cell distribution width, the hematocrit
(ratio of the volume of the red blood cells to the
blood volume), and the amount of hemoglobin (the
blood protein that carries oxygen). Although CBCs
are used on more than just AIDS patients, they can
help the doctor determine if an AIDS patient has an
advanced form of the disease. Specific AIDS-related
signs in a CBC include a low hematocrit, a sharp
decrease in the number of blood platelets, and a
low level of a certain type of white blood cell called
neutrophils.
Absolute CD4+ lymphocytes. A lymphocyte is a
type of white blood cell that is important in the
formation of an immune response. Because HIV
targets CD4+ lymphocytes, their number in the
patient’s blood can be used to track the course of
the infection. This blood cell count is considered the
most accurate indicator for the presence of an opportunistic infection in an AIDS patient. The absolute
CD4+ lymphocyte count is obtained by multiplying

92

CD4+ lymphocyte percentage. Some doctors think
that this is a more accurate test than the absolute
count because the percentage does not depend on a
manual calculation of the number of types of different white blood cells. A white blood cell count that is
broken down into categories in this way is called a
WBC differential.

It is important for doctors treating AIDS patients
to measure the lymphocyte count on a regular basis.
Experts consulted by the United States Public Health
Service recommend the following frequency of serum
testing based on the patient’s CD4+ level:
CD4+ count more than 600 cells/mm3: Every six
months.



CD4+ count between 200-600 cells/mm3: Every
three months.



CD4+ count less than 200 cells/mm3: Every three
months.



When the CD4+ count falls below 200 cells/mm3,
the doctor will put the patient on a medication regimen to protect him or her against opportunistic
infections.
HIV VIRAL LOAD TESTS. Another type of blood test
for monitoring AIDS patients is the viral load test. It
supplements the CD4+ count, which can tell the doctor the extent of the patient’s loss of immune function,
but not the speed of HIV replication in the body. The
viral load test is based on PCR techniques and can
measure the number of copies of HIV nucleic acids.
Successive test results for a given patient’s viral load
are calculated on a base 10 logarithmic scale.
ORAL HIV TESTS. Scientists have developed oral
HIV tests that can be conducted with saliva samples.
One of the unintented effects of these tests is the
misperception that HIV can be transmitted through
saliva. Still, they present an excellent alternative to
blood sample testing.
RAPID HIV TESTS. Researchers constantly work on
more rapid tests for HIV that can be done in physician
offices or by less skilled people and more convenient
locations in developing countries. A finger-stick test
that can be read quickly from a whole blood sample
had shown promising results in the fall of 2003.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

In 2004, a new three-minute test for HIV was
lunched in the United States under FDA approval.
The hope of this test is that health care providers
such as family practice physician offices can quickly
test a patient in the office and provide results while the
patient waits, rather than sending results to a lab.
BETA2-MICROGLOBULIN (BETA2M). Beta-microglo-

bulin is a protein found on the surface of all human
cells with a nucleus. It is released into the blood when a
cell dies. Although rising blood levels of 2M are found
in patients with cancer and other serious diseases, a
rising 2M blood level can be used to measure the
progression of AIDS.
P24 ANTIGEN CAPTURE ASSAY. Found in the viral
core of HIV, p24 is a protein that can be measured by
the ELISA technique. Doctors can use p24 assays to
measure the antiviral activity of the patient’s medications. In addition, the p24 assay is sometimes useful
in detecting HIV infection before seroconversion.
However, p24 is consistently present in only 25% of
persons infected with HIV.
GENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TEST. Genotypic
testing can help determine whether specific gene
mutations, common in people with HIV, are causing
drug resistance and drug failure. The test looks for
specific genetic mutations within the virus that are
known to cause resistance to certain drugs used in
HIV treatment. For example the drug 3TC, also
known as lamivudine (Epivir), is not effective against
strains of HIV that have a mutation at a particular
position on the reverse transcriptase protein—amino
acid 184—known as M184V (M!V, methionine to
valine). So if the genotypic resistance test shows a
mutation at position M184V, it is likely the person
is resistant to 3TC and not likely to respond to 3TC
treatment. Genotypic tests are only effective if the
person is already taking antiviral medication and if
the viral load is greater than 1,000 copies per milliliter
(mL) of blood. The cost of the test, usually between
$300 and $500, is usually now covered by many insurance plans.
PHENOTYPIC

Phenotypic testing directly measures the sensitivity of
a patient’s HIV to particular drugs and drug combinations. To do this, it measures the concentration of a
drug required to inhibit viral replication in the test

tube. This is the same method used by researchers to
determine whether a drug might be effective against
HIV before using it in human clinical trials.
Phenotypic testing is a more direct measurement of
resistance than genotypic testing. Also, unlike genotypic testing, phenotypic testing does not require a high
viral load but it is recommended that persons already
be taking antiretroviral drugs. The cost is between $700
and $900 and is now covered by many insurance plans.
AIDS serology in children
Children born to HIV-infected mothers may
acquire the infection through the mother’s placenta
or during the birth process. Public health experts
recommend the testing and monitoring of all children
born to mothers with HIV. Diagnostic testing in children older than 18 months is similar to adult testing,
with ELISA screening confirmed by Western blot.
Younger infants can be diagnosed by direct culture
of the HIV virus, PCR testing, and p24 antigen testing.
These techniques allow a pediatrician to identify 50%
of infected children at or near birth, and 95% of cases
in infants three to six months of age.

Preparation
Preparation and aftercare are important parts of
AIDS diagnostic testing. Doctors are now advised to
take the patient’s emotional, social, economic, and
other circumstances into account and to provide counseling before and after testing. Patients are generally
better able to cope with the results if the doctor has
spent some time with them before the blood test
explaining the basic facts about HIV infection and
testing. Many doctors now offer this type of informational counseling before performing the tests.

Aftercare
If the test results indicate that the patient is HIVpositive, he or she will need counseling, information,
referral for treatment, and support. Doctors can either
counsel the patient themselves or invite an experienced
HIV counselor to discuss the results of the blood tests
with the patient. They also will assess the patient’s
emotional and psychological status, including the possibility of violent behavior and the availability of a
support network.

Risks
The risks of AIDS testing are primarily related to
disclosure of the patient’s HIV status rather than to
any physical risks connected with blood testing. Some

Another test, called the VScan test kit, requires no
refrigeration or electricity and can safely be stored at

confirmed by ELISA or Western blotting, an accurate

antibodies.

ALT levels are used to detect liver abnormalities.
Since the alanine aminotransferase enzyme is also
found in muscle, tests indicating elevated AST levels
might also indicate muscle damage. However, other
tests, such as the levels of the MB fraction of creatine
kinase should indicate whether the abnormal test
levels are because of muscle or liver damage.

Description
The alanine aminotransferase test (ALT) can
reveal liver damage. It is probably the most specific
test for liver damage. However, the severity of the liver
damage is not necessarily shown by the ALT test, since
the amount of dead liver tissue does not correspond to
higher ALT levels. Also, patients with normal, or
declining, ALT levels may experience serious liver
damage without an increase in ALT.
Nevertheless, ALT is widely used, and useful,
because ALT levels are elevated in most patients with
liver disease. Although ALT levels do not necessarily
indicate the severity of the damage to the liver, they
may indicate how much of the liver has been damaged.
ALT levels, when compared to the levels of a similar
enzyme, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), may provide important clues to the nature of the liver disease.
For example, within a certain range of values, a ratio
of 2:1 or greater for AST: ALT might indicate that a
patient suffers from alcoholic liver disease. Other diagnostic data may be gleaned from ALT tests to indicate
abnormal results.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Description

No special preparations are necessary for this test.

Aftercare
This test involves blood being drawn, probably
from a vein in the patient’s elbow. The patient should
keep the wound from the needle puncture covered
(with a bandage) until the bleeding stops. Patients
should report any unusual symptoms to their
physician.

Normal results
Normal values vary from laboratory to laboratory, and should be available to your physician at the
time of the test. An informal survey of some laboratories indicates many laboratories find values from
approximately seven to 50 IU/L to be normal.

Abnormal results
Low levels of ALT (generally below 300 IU/L)
may indicate any kind of liver disease. Levels above
1,000 IU/L generally indicate extensive liver damage
from toxins or drugs, viral hepatitis, or a lack of oxygen (usually resulting from very low blood pressure or
a heart attack). A briefly elevated ALT above 1,000
IU/L that resolves in 24-48 hours may indicate a
blockage of the bile duct. More moderate levels of
ALT (300-1,000IU/L) may support a diagnosis of
acute or chronic hepatitis.
It is important to note that persons with normal
livers may have slightly elevated levels of ALT. This is
a normal finding.

I Albinism
Definition
Albinism is an inherited condition present at
birth, characterized by a lack of pigment that normally
gives color to the skin, hair, and eyes. Many types of
albinism exist, all of which involve lack of pigment in
varying degrees. The condition, which is found in all
races, may be accompanied by eye problems and may
lead to skin cancer later in life.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Albinism is a rare disorder found in fewer than
five people per 100,000 in the United States and
Europe. Other parts of the world have a much higher
rate; for example, albinism is found in about 20 out of
every 100,000 people in southern Nigeria.
There are 10 types of the most common form of the
condition, known as ‘‘oculocutaneous albinism,’’ which
affects the eyes, hair, and skin. In its most severe form,
hair and skin remain pure white throughout life. People
with a less severe form are born with white hair and skin,
which turn slightly darker as they age. Everyone with
oculocutaneous albinism experiences abnormal flickering eye movements (nystagmus) and sensitivity to bright
light. There may be other eye problems as well, including poor vision and crossed or ‘‘lazy’’ eyes (strabismus).
The second most common type of the condition is
known as ‘‘ocular’’ albinism, in which only the eyes
lack color; skin and hair are normal. There are five
forms of ocular albinism; some types cause more problems–especially eye problems–than others.

Causes and symptoms
Every cell in the body contains a matched pair of
genes, one inherited from each parent. These genes act
as a sort of ‘‘blueprint’’ that guides the development of
a fetus.
Albinism is an inherited problem caused by a flaw
in one or more of the genes that are responsible for
directing the eyes and skin to make melanin (pigment).
As a result, little or no pigment is made, and the child’s
skin, eyes and hair may be colorless.
In most types of albinism, a recessive trait, the
child inherits flawed genes for making melanin from
both parents. Because the task of making melanin is
complex, there are many different types of albinism,
involving a number of different genes.
It’s also possible to inherit one normal gene and
one albinism gene. In this case, the one normal gene
provides enough information in its cellular blueprint
to make some pigment, and the child will have normal
skin and eye color. They ‘‘carry’’ one gene for albinism. About one in 70 people are albinism carriers, with
one flawed gene but no symptoms; they have a 50%
chance of passing the albinism gene to their child.
However, if both parents are carriers with one flawed
gene each, they have a 1 in 4 chance of passing on both
copies of the flawed gene to the child, who will have
albinism. (There is also a type of ocular albinism that
is carried on the X chromosome and occurs almost
exclusively in males because they have only one X

chromosome and, therefore, no other gene for the trait
to override the flawed one.)
Symptoms of albinism can involve the skin, hair,
and eyes. The skin, because it contains little pigment,
appears very light, as does the hair.
Although people with albinism may experience a
variety of eye problems, one of the myths about albinism is that it causes people to have pink or red eyes. In
fact, people with albinism can have irises varying from
light gray or blue to brown. (The iris is the colored
portion of the eye that controls the size of the pupil,
the opening that lets light into the eye.) If people with
albinism seem to have reddish eyes, it’s because light is
being reflected from the back of the eye (retina) in
much the same way as happens when people are
photographed with an electronic flash.
People with albinism may have one or more of the
following eye problems:
96



They may be very far-sighted or near-sighted, and
may have other defects in the curvature of the lens of
the eye (astigmatism) that cause images to appear
unfocused.



They may have a constant, involuntary movement of
the eyeball called nystagmus.



They may have problems in coordinating the eyes in
fixing and tracking objects (strabismus), which may
lead to an appearance of having ‘‘crossed eyes’’ at
times. Strabismus may cause some problems with
depth perception, especially at close distances.



They may be very sensitive to light (photophobia)
because their irises allow ‘‘stray’’ light to enter their
eyes. It’s a common misconception that people with
albinism shouldn’t go out on sunny days, but wearing sunglasses can make it possible to go outside
quite comfortably.

building blocks of protein. The body breaks down
the protein in food into amino acids, and then uses
these amino acids to create other proteins. The body
also changes amino acids into melanin pigment.
Astigmatism—An eye condition in which the lens

helps change tyrosine to DOPA during the process
of making melanin.

In addition to the characteristically light skin and
eye problems, people with a rare form of albinism
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

called Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) also
have a greater tendency to have bleeding disorders,
inflammation of the large bowel (colitis), lung (pulmonary) disease, and kidney (renal) problems.

Diagnosis
It’s not always easy to diagnose the exact type
of albinism a person has; there are two tests available that can identify only two types of the condition. Recently, a blood test has been developed that
can identify carriers of the gene for some types of
albinism; a similar test during amniocentesis can
diagnose some types of albinism in an unborn
child. A chorionic villus sampling test during the fifth
week of pregnancy may also reveal some types of
albinism.
The specific type of albinism a person has can be
determined by taking a good family history and examining the patient and several close relatives.
The ‘‘hairbulb pigmentation test’’ is used to identify carriers by incubating a piece of the person’s hair
in a solution of tyrosine, a substance in food which the
body uses to make melanin. If the hair turns dark, it
means the hair is making melanin (a ‘‘positive’’ test);
light hair means there is no melanin. This test is the
source of the names of two types of albinism: ‘‘ty-pos’’
and ‘‘ty-neg.’’
The tyrosinase test is more precise than the
hairbulb pigmentation test. It measures the rate at
which hair converts tyrosine into another chemical
(DOPA), which is then made into pigment. The hair
converts tyrosine with the help of a substance called
‘‘tyrosinase.’’ In some types of albinism, tyrosinase
doesn’t do its job, and melanin production breaks
down.

Treatment
There is no treatment that can replace the lack of
melanin that causes the symptoms of albinism.
Doctors can only treat, not cure, the eye problems
that often accompany the lack of skin color. Glasses
are usually needed and can be tinted to ease pain from
too much sunlight. There is no cure for involuntary
eye movements (nystagmus), and treatments for
focusing problems (surgery or contact lenses) are not
effective in all cases.
Crossed eyes (strabismus) can be treated during
infancy, using eye patches, surgery or medicine injections. Treatment may improve the appearance of the
eye, but it can do nothing to cure the underlying
condition.

Patients with albinism should avoid excessive
exposure to the sun, especially between 10 a.m. and
2 p.m. If exposure can’t be avoided, they should use
UVA-UVB sunblocks with an SPF of at least 20.
Taking beta- carotene may help provide some skin
color, although it doesn’t protect against sun
exposure.

Prognosis
In the United States, people with this condition
can expect to have a normal lifespan. People with
albinism may experience some social problems
because of a lack of understanding on the part of
others. When a member of a normally dark-skinned
ethnic group has albinism, he or she may face some
very complex social challenges.
One of the greatest health hazards for people with
albinism is excessive exposure to sun without protection, which could lead to skin cancer. Wearing opaque
clothes and sunscreen rated SPF 20, people with albinism can safely work and play outdoors safely even
during the summer.

I Alcohol-related
neurologic
disease
Definition
Alcohol, or ethanol, is a poison with direct toxic
effects on nerve and muscle cells. Depending on
which nerve and muscle pathways are involved,
alcohol can have far-reaching effects on different
parts of the brain, peripheral nerves, and muscles,
with symptoms of memory loss, incoordination,
seizures, weakness, and sensory deficits. These different effects can be grouped into three main categories:
(1) intoxication due to the acute effects of ethanol, (2)
withdrawal syndrome from suddenly stopping drinking, and (3) disorders related to long-term or chronic
alcohol abuse. Alcohol-related neurologic disease
includes Wernicke-Korsakoff disease, alcoholic
cerebellar degeneration, alcoholic myopathy, alcoholic neuropathy, alcohol withdrawal syndrome
with seizures and delirium tremens, and fetal alcohol
syndrome.

Acute excess intake of alcohol can cause drunkenness (intoxication) or even death, and chronic or longterm abuse leads to potentially irreversible damage to
virtually any level of the nervous system. Any given
patient with long-term alcohol abuse may have no
neurologic complications, a single alcohol-related disease, or multiple conditions, depending on the genes
they have inherited, how well nourished they are, and
other environmental factors, such as exposure to other
drugs or toxins.
Neurologic complications of alcohol abuse may also
result from nutritional deficiency, because alcoholics tend
to eat poorly and may become depleted of thiamine or
other vitamins important for nervous system function.
Persons who are intoxicated are also at higher risk for
head injury or for compression injuries of the peripheral
nerves. Sudden changes in blood chemistry, especially
sodium, related to alcohol abuse may cause central pontine myelinolysis, a condition of the brainstem in which
nerves lose their myelin coating. Liver disease complicating alcoholic cirrhosis may cause dementia, delirium, and
movement disorder.

large molecules from escaping from the blood vessel to
the brain tissue. Drunkenness, or intoxication, may
occur at blood ethanol concentrations of as low as
50-150 mg per dL in people who don’t drink.
Sleepiness, stupor, coma, or even death from respiratory depression and low blood pressure occur at
progressively higher concentrations.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Although alcohol is broken down by the liver,
the toxic effects from a high dose of alcohol are most
likely a direct result of alcohol itself rather than of its
breakdown products. The fatal dose varies widely
because people who drink heavily develop a tolerance to the effects of alcohol with repeated use. In
addition, alcohol tolerance results in the need for
higher levels of blood alcohol to achieve intoxicating
effects, which increases the likelihood that habitual
drinkers will be exposed to high and potentially toxic
levels of ethanol. This is particularly true when binge
drinkers fail to eat, because fasting decreases the rate
of alcohol clearance and causes even higher blood
alcohol levels.
When a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking, withdrawal of alcohol leads to a syndrome of
increased excitability of the central nervous system,
called delirium tremens or ‘‘DTs.’’ Symptoms begin
six to eight hours after abstinence, and are most pronounced 24-72 hours after abstinence. They include
body shaking (tremulousness), insomnia, agitation,
confusion, hearing voices or seeing images that are
not really there (such as crawling bugs), seizures,
rapid heart beat, profuse sweating, high blood pressure, and fever. Alcohol-related seizures may also
occur without withdrawal, such as during active
heavy drinking or after more than a week without
alcohol.
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is caused by
deficiency of the B-vitamin thiamine, and can also
be seen in people who don’t drink but have some
other cause of thiamine deficiency, such as chronic
vomiting that prevents the absorption of this vitamin.
A 2004 study demonstrated that alcohol-dependent
patients admitted to a detoxification facility had consumed significantly less thiamine than a comparison
group of healthy volunteers. Patients with this condition have the sudden onset of Wernicke encephalopathy; the symptoms include marked confusion,
delirium, disorientation, inattention, memory loss,
and drowsiness. Examination reveals abnormalities
of eye movement, including jerking of the eyes
(nystagmus) and double vision. Problems with balance make walking difficult. People may have trouble
coordinating their leg movements, but usually not
their arms. If thiamine is not given promptly,
Wernicke encephalopathy may progress to stupor,
coma, and death.
If thiamine is given and death averted, Korsakoff’s
syndrome may develop in some patients, who suffer
from memory impairment that leaves them unable to
remember events for a period of a few years before the
onset of illness (retrograde amnesia) and unable to

learn new information (anterograde amnesia). Most
patients have very limited insight into their memory
dysfunction and have a tendency to make up explanations for events they have forgotten (confabulation).
Severe alcoholism can cause cerebellar degeneration, a slowly progressive condition affecting portions
of the brain called the anterior and superior cerebellar
vermis, causing a wide-based gait, leg incoordination,
and an inability to walk heel-to-toe in tightrope fashion. The gait disturbance usually develops over several
weeks, but may be relatively mild for some time, and
then suddenly worsen after binge drinking or an unrelated illness.
Fetal alcohol syndrome occurs in infants born to
alcoholic mothers when prenatal exposure to ethanol
retards fetal growth and development. Affected
infants often have a distinctive appearance with a
thin upper lip, flat nose and mid-face, short stature
and small head size. Almost half are mentally
retarded, and most others are mildly impaired intellectually or have problems with speech, learning, and
behavior. Fetal alcohol syndrome is the leading cause
of mental retardation and many physicians warn that
there is no safe level of alcohol for a pregnant mother
to consume.
Alcoholic myopathy, or weakness secondary to
breakdown of muscle tissue, is also known as alcoholic
rhabdomyolysis or alcoholic myoglobinuria. Males
are affected by acute (sudden onset) alcoholic myopathy four times as often as females. Breakdown of
muscle tissue (myonecrosis), can come on suddenly
during binge drinking or in the first days of alcohol
withdrawal. In its mildest form, this breakdown may
cause no noticeable symptoms, but may be detected by
a temporary elevation in blood levels of an enzyme
found predominantly in muscle, the MM fraction of
creatine kinase.
The severe form of acute alcoholic myopathy is
associated with the sudden onset of muscle pain, swelling, and weakness; a reddish tinge in the urine caused
by myoglobin, a breakdown product of muscle
excreted in the urine; and a rapid rise in muscle
enzymes in the blood. Symptoms usually worsen over
hours to a few days, and then improve over the next
week to 10 days as the patient is withdrawn from
alcohol. Muscle symptoms are usually generalized,
but pain and swelling may selectively involve the
calves or other muscle groups. The muscle breakdown
of acute alcoholic myopathy may be worsened by
crush injuries, which may occur when people drink
so much that they compress a muscle group with
their body weight for a long time without moving, or
100

by withdrawal seizures with generalized muscle
activity.
In patients who abuse alcohol over many years,
chronic alcoholic myopathy may develop. Males and
females are equally affected. Symptoms include painless weakness of the limb muscles closest to the trunk
and the girdle muscles, including the thighs, hips,
shoulders, and upper arms. This weakness develops
gradually, over weeks or months, without symptoms
of acute muscle injury. Muscle atrophy, or decreased
bulk, may be striking. The nerves of the extremities
may also begin to break down, a condition known as
alcoholic peripheral neuropathy, which can add to the
person’s difficulty in moving.
The way in which alcohol destroys muscle tissue is
still not well understood. Proposed mechanisms
include muscle membrane changes affecting the transport of calcium, potassium, or other minerals;
impaired muscle energy metabolism; and impaired
protein synthesis. Alcohol is metabolized or broken
down primarily by the liver, with a series of chemical
reactions in which ethanol is converted to acetate.
Acetate is metabolized by skeletal muscle, and alcohol-related changes in liver function may affect skeletal muscle metabolism, decreasing the amount of
blood sugar available to muscles during prolonged
activity. Because not enough sugar is available to supply needed energy, muscle protein may be broken
down as an alternate energy source. However, toxic
effects on muscle may be a direct result of alcohol itself
rather than of its breakdown products.
Although alcoholic peripheral neuropathy may
contribute to muscle weakness and atrophy by injuring the motor nerves controlling muscle movement,
alcoholic neuropathy more commonly affects sensory
fibers. Injury to these fibers can cause tingling or burning pain in the feet, which may be severe enough to
interfere with walking. As the condition worsens, pain
decreases but numbness increases.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of alcohol-related neurologic disease depends largely on finding characteristic symptoms and signs in patients who abuse alcohol. Other
possible causes should be excluded by the appropriate
tests, which may include blood chemistry, thyroid
function tests, brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography scan), and/or
cerebrospinal fluid analysis.
Acute alcoholic myopathy can be diagnosed
by finding myoglobin in the urine and increased
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment
Acute management of alcohol intoxication, delirium tremens, and withdrawal is primarily supportive,
to monitor and treat any cardiovascular or respiratory
failure that may develop. In delirium tremens, fever
and sweating may necessitate treatment of fluid loss
and secondary low blood pressure. Agitation may be
treated with benzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide,
beta-adrenergic antagonists such as atenolol, or alpha
2-adrenergic agonists such as clonidine. Because
Wernicke’s syndrome is rapidly reversible with thiamine, and because death may intervene if thiamine is
not given promptly, all patients admitted for acute
complications of alcohol, as well as all patients with
unexplained encephalopathy, should be given intravenous thiamine.
Withdrawal seizures typically resolve without
specific anti-epileptic drug treatment, although status
epilepticus (continual seizures occurring without interruption) should be treated vigorously. Acute alcoholic
myopathy with myoglobinuria requires monitoring
and maintenance of kidney function, and correction
of imbalances in blood chemistry including potassium,
phosphate, and magnesium levels.
Chronic alcoholic myopathy and other chronic
conditions are treated by correcting associated nutritional deficiencies and maintaining a diet adequate in
protein and carbohydrate. The key to treating any
alcohol-related disease is helping the patient overcome
alcohol addiction. Behavioral measures and social supports may be needed in patients who develop broad
problems in their thinking abilities (dementia) or
remain in a state of confusion and disorientation
(delirium). People with walking disturbances may
benefit from physical therapy and assistive devices.
Doctors may also prescribe drugs to treat the pain
associated with peripheral neuropathy.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Prognosis
Complete recovery from Wernicke’s syndrome
may follow prompt administration of thiamine.
However, repeated episodes of encephalopathy or
prolonged alcohol abuse may cause persistent dementia or Korsakoff psychosis. Most patients recover fully
from acute alcoholic myopathy within days to weeks,
but severe cases may be fatal from acute kidney failure
and disturbances in heart rhythm secondary to
increased potassium levels. Recovery from chronic
alcoholic myopathy may occur over weeks to months
of abstinence from alcohol and correction of malnutrition. Cerebellar degeneration and alcoholic neuropathy may also improve to some extent with abstinence
and balanced diet, depending on the severity and duration of the condition.

Prevention
Prevention requires abstinence from alcohol.
Persons who consume small or moderate amounts of
alcohol might theoretically help prevent nutritional
complications of alcohol use with dietary supplements
including B vitamins. However, proper nutrition cannot protect against the direct toxic effect of alcohol or
of its breakdown products. Patients with any alcoholrelated symptoms or conditions, pregnant women,
and patients with liver or neurologic disease should
abstain completely. Persons with family history of
alcoholism or alcohol-related conditions may also be
at increased risk for neurologic complications of alcohol use.

Definition
Alcoholism is the popular term for alcohol abuse
and alcohol dependence. These disorders involve
repeated life problems that can be directly attributed
to the use of alcohol. Both disorders can have serious
consequences, affecting an individual’s health and personal life, as well as having an impact on society at large.

Description
The effects of alcoholism are far reaching.
Alcohol affects every body system, causing a wide
range of health problems. Problems include poor
nutrition, memory disorders, difficulty with balance
and walking, liver disease (including cirrhosis and
hepatitis), high blood pressure, muscle weakness
(including the heart), heart rhythm disturbances,
anemia, clotting disorders, decreased immunity to
infections, gastrointestinal inflammation and irritation, acute and chronic problems with the pancreas,
low blood sugar, high blood fat content, interference
with reproductive fertility, and weakened bones.
On a personal level, alcoholism results in marital
and other relationship difficulties, depression, unemployment, child abuse, and general family dysfunction.
Alcoholism causes or contributes to a variety of
severe social problems including homelessness, murder, suicide, injury, and violent crime. Alcohol is a
contributing factor in at least 50% of all deaths from
motor vehicle accidents. In fact, about 100,000 deaths
occur each year due to the effects of alcohol, of which
50% are due to injuries of some sort. According to a
special report prepared for the U.S. Congress by the
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,
the impact of alcohol on society, including violence,
traffic accidents, lost work productivity, and premature death, costs our nation an estimated $185 billion
annually. In addition, it is estimated that approximately one in four children (19 million children or
29% of children up to 17 years of age) is exposed at
some time to familial alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, or both. Furthermore, it has been estimated
that approximately 18% of adults experience an
102

episode of alcohol abuse or dependence a some time
during their lives.

Causes and symptoms
There are probably a number of factors that work
together to cause a person to become an alcoholic.
Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that close
relatives of an alcoholic are four times more likely to
become alcoholics themselves. Furthermore, this risk
holds true even for children who were adopted away
from their biological families at birth and raised in a
non-alcoholic adoptive family, with no knowledge of
their biological family’s difficulties with alcohol. More
research is being conducted to determine if genetic
factors could account for differences in alcohol metabolism that may increase the risk of an individual
becoming an alcoholic.
The symptoms of alcoholism can be broken down
into two major categories: symptoms of acute alcohol
use and symptoms of long-term alcohol use.
Immediate (acute) effects of alcohol use
Alcohol exerts a depressive effect on the brain. The
blood-brain barrier does not prevent alcohol from
entering the brain, so the brain alcohol level will quickly
become equivalent to the blood alcohol level. Alcohol’s
depressive effects result in difficulty walking, poor balance, slurring of speech, and generally poor coordination (accounting in part for the increased likelihood of
injury). The affected person also may have impairment
of peripheral vision. At higher alcohol levels, a person’s
breathing and heart rates will be slowed, and vomiting
may occur (with a high risk of the vomit being breathed
into the lungs, resulting in severe problems, including
the possibility of pneumonia). Still higher alcohol levels
may result in coma and death.
Effects of long-term (chronic) alcoholism
Long-term use of alcohol affects virtually every
organ system of the body:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Blood-brain barrier— A network of blood vessels
characterized by closely spaced cells that prevents
many potentially toxic substances from penetrating
the blood vessel walls to enter the brain. Alcohol is
able to cross this barrier.
Detoxification—The phase of treatment during
which a patient stops drinking and is monitored
and cared for while he or she experiences withdrawal from alcohol.
Relapse—A return to a disease state, after recovery
appeared to be occurring. In alcoholism, relapse
refers to a patient beginning to drink alcohol again
after a period of avoiding alcohol.
Tolerance—A phenomenon during which a drinker becomes physically accustomed to a particular
quantity of alcohol, and requires ever-increasing
quantities in order to obtain the same effects.



Blood. Alcohol can cause changes to all the types of
blood cells. Red blood cells become abnormally
large. White blood cells (important for fighting infections) decrease in number, resulting in a weakened
immune system. This places alcoholics at increased
risk for infections, and is thought to account in part
for the increased risk of cancer faced by alcoholics
(10 times the risk for nonalcoholics). Platelets and
blood clotting factors are affected, causing an
increased risk of bleeding.



Heart. Small amounts of alcohol cause a drop in
blood pressure, but with increased use, alcohol
begins to increase blood pressure into a dangerous
range. High levels of fats circulating in the bloodstream increase the risk of heart disease. Heavy
drinking results in an increase in heart size, weakening of the heart muscle, abnormal heart rhythms, a
risk of blood clots forming within the chambers of the
heart, and a greatly increased risk of stroke (due to a
blood clot from the heart entering the circulatory
system, going to the brain, and blocking a brain
blood vessel).



Reproductive system. Heavy drinking has a negative
effect on fertility in both men and women, by
decreasing testicle and ovary size, and interfering
with both sperm and egg production. When pregnancy is achieved in an alcoholic woman, the baby
has a great risk of being born with fetal alcohol
syndrome, which causes distinctive facial defects,
lowered IQ, and behavioral problems.

Withdrawal—Those signs and symptoms experienced by a person who has become physically
dependent on a drug, experienced upon decreasing
the drug’s dosage or discontinuing its use.





Nervous system. An estimated 30-40% of all men in
their teens and twenties have experienced alcoholic
blackout, which occurs when drinking a large quantity of alcohol results in the loss of memory of the
time surrounding the episode of drinking. Alcohol is
well-known to cause sleep disturbances, so that overall sleep quality is affected. Numbness and tingling
may occur in the arms and legs. Two syndromes,
which can occur together or separately, are known
as Wernicke’s and Korsakoff’s syndromes. Both are
due to the low thiamine (a form of vitamin B
complex) levels found in alcoholics. Wernicke’s
syndrome results in disordered eye movements, very
poor balance and difficulty walking, while
Korsakoff’s syndrome severely affects one’s memory,
preventing new learning from taking place.
Gastrointestinal system. Alcohol causes loosening of
the muscular ring that prevents the stomach’s contents from re-entering the esophagus. Therefore, the
acid from the stomach flows backward into the esophagus, burning those tissues, and causing pain and
bleeding. Inflammation of the stomach also can
result in bleeding and pain, and decreased desire to
eat. A major cause of severe, uncontrollable bleeding
(hemorrhage) in an alcoholic is the development
of enlarged (dilated) blood vessels within the

esophagus, which are called esophageal varices.
These varices actually are developed in response to
liver disease, and are extremely prone to bursting and
hemorrhaging. Diarrhea is a common symptom, due
to alcohol’s effect on the pancreas. In addition,
inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) is a serious and painful problem in alcoholics. Throughout
the intestinal tract, alcohol interferes with the
absorption of nutrients, creating a malnourished
state. Because alcohol is broken down (metabolized)
within the liver, the organ is severely affected by
constant levels of alcohol. Alcohol interferes with a
number of important chemical processes that also
occur in the liver. The liver begins to enlarge and fill
with fat (fatty liver), fibrous scar tissue interferes with
the liver’s normal structure and function (cirrhosis),
and the liver may become inflamed (hepatitis).

on the use of alcohol. Three of the following traits
must be present to diagnose alcohol dependence:


tolerance, meaning that a person becomes accustomed to a particular dose of alcohol, and must
increase the dose in order to obtain the desired effect



withdrawal, meaning that a person experiences
unpleasant physical and psychological symptoms
when he or she does not drink alcohol



the tendency to drink more alcohol than one intends
(once an alcoholic starts to drink, he or she finds it
difficult to stop)



being unable to avoid drinking or stop drinking once
started



having large blocks of time taken up by alcohol use



choosing to drink at the expense of other important
tasks or activities



drinking despite evidence of negative effects on one’s
health, relationships, education, or job

Diagnosis is sometimes brought about when
family members call an alcoholic’s difficulties to the
attention of a physician. A clinician may begin to be
suspicious when a patient suffers repeated injuries or
begins to experience medical problems related to
the use of alcohol. In fact, some estimates suggest
that about 20% of a physician’s patients will be
alcoholics.
Diagnosis is aided by administering specific psychological assessments that try to determine what
aspects of a person’s life may be affected by his or
her use of alcohol. Determining the exact quantity of
alcohol that a person drinks is of much less importance than determining how his or her drinking affects
relationships, jobs, educational goals, and family life.
In fact, because the metabolism (how the body breaks
down and processes) of alcohol is so individual, the
quantity of alcohol consumed is not part of the criteria
list for diagnosing either alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse.
One simple tool for beginning the diagnosis of
alcoholism is called the CAGE questionnaire. It consists of four questions, with the first letters of each key
word spelling out the word CAGE:


Have you ever tried to Cut down on your drinking?



Have you ever been Annoyed by anyone’s comments
about your drinking?



Have you ever felt Guilty about your drinking?



Do you ever need an Eye-opener (a morning drink of
alcohol) to start the day)?

104

Other, longer lists of questions exist to help determine the severity and effects of a person’s alcohol use.
Given the recent research pointing to a genetic basis
for alcoholism, it is important to ascertain whether
anyone else in the person’s family has ever suffered
from alcoholism.

Treatment
Treatment of alcoholism has two parts. The first
step in the treatment of alcoholism, called detoxification, involves helping the person stop drinking and
ridding his or her body of the harmful (toxic) effects
of alcohol. Because the person’s body has become
accustomed to alcohol, the person will need to be
supported through withdrawal. Withdrawal will be
different for different patients, depending on the severity of the alcoholism, as measured by the quantity of
alcohol ingested daily and the length of time the
patient has been an alcoholic. Withdrawal symptoms
can range from mild to life-threatening. Mild withdrawal symptoms include nausea, achiness, diarrhea,
difficulty sleeping, sweatiness, anxiety, and trembling.
This phase is usually over in about three to five days.
More severe effects of withdrawal can include hallucinations (in which a patient sees, hears, or feels something that is not actually real), seizures, an unbearable
craving for more alcohol, confusion, fever, fast heart
rate, high blood pressure, and delirium (a fluctuating
level of consciousness). Patients at highest risk for the
most severe symptoms of withdrawal (referred to as
delirium tremens) are those with other medical
problems, including malnutrition, liver disease, or
Wernicke’s syndrome. Delirium tremens usually
begin about three to five days after the patient’s last
drink, progressing from the more mild symptoms to
the more severe, and may last a number of days.
Patients going through only mild withdrawal are
simply monitored carefully to make sure that more
severe symptoms do not develop. No medications are
necessary, however. Treatment of a patient suffering
the more severe effects of withdrawal may require the
use of sedative medications to relieve the discomfort of
withdrawal and to avoid the potentially life-threatening complications of high blood pressure, fast heart
rate, and seizures. Drugs called benzodiazapines are
helpful in those patients suffering from hallucinations.
Because of the patient’s nausea, fluids may need to be
given through a vein (intravenously), along with some
necessary sugars and salts. It is crucial that thiamine
be included in the fluids, because thiamine is usually
quite low in alcoholic patients, and deficiency of thiamine is responsible for the Wernicke-Korsakoff
syndrome.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Sessions led by peers, where recovering alcoholics
meet regularly and provide support for each other’s
recoveries, are considered among the best methods of
preventing a return to drinking (relapse). Perhaps the
most well-known such group is called Alcoholics
Anonymous, which uses a ‘‘12-step’’ model to help
people avoid drinking. These steps involve recognizing
the destructive power that alcohol has held over
the alcoholic’s life, looking to a higher power for
help in overcoming the problem, and reflecting on
the ways in which the use of alcohol has hurt others
and, if possible, making amends to those people.
According to a recent study reported by the American
Psychological Association (APA), anyone, regardless
of his or her religious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs,
can benefit from participation in 12-step programs
such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics
Anonymous (NA). The number of visits to 12-step
self-help groups exceeds the number of visits to all
mental health professionals combined.
There are also medications that may help an alcoholic avoid returning to drinking. These have been
used with variable success. Disulfiram (Antabuse)
is a drug which, when mixed with alcohol, causes
unpleasant reactions including nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and trembling. Naltrexone, along with a
similar compound, Nalmefene, can be helpful in limiting the effects of a relapse. Acamprosate is helpful in
preventing relapse. None of these medications would
be helpful unless the patient was also willing to work
very hard to change his or her behavior. In 2004, a new
compound was discovered that blocks actions of
chemicals in the brain that may lead to relapses.
Clinical tests were still underway, but development of
such a drug could have great potential in the medical
management of alcoholism. Another study that year
found that topiramate (Topamax), an antiseizure
medication, was effective in treating alcohol dependence in 150 participants in a clinical trial. The authors
called for further study of this possible treatment.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments can be a helpful adjunct
for the alcoholic patient, once the medical danger of
withdrawal has passed. Because many alcoholics
have very stressful lives (whether because of or leading to the alcoholism is sometimes a matter of
debate), many of the treatments for alcoholism
involve dealing with and relieving stress. These
include massage, meditation, and hypnotherapy. The
malnutrition of long-term alcohol use is addressed by
nutrition-oriented practitioners with careful attention to a healthy diet and the use of nutritional supplements such as vitamins A, B complex, and C, as
well as certain fatty acids, amino acids, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. Herbal treatments include milk
thistle (Silybum marianum), which is thought to protect the liver against damage. Other herbs are thought
to be helpful for the patient suffering through withdrawal. Some of these include lavender (Lavandula
officinalis), skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora), chamomile (Matricaria recutita), peppermint (Mentha
piperita) yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and valerian
(Valeriana officinalis). Acupuncture is believed to
both decrease withdrawal symptoms and to help
improve a patient’s chances for continued recovery
from alcoholism.

Prognosis
Recovery from alcoholism is a life-long process.
In fact, people who have suffered from alcoholism are
encouraged to refer to themselves ever after as ‘‘a
recovering alcoholic,’’ never a recovered alcoholic.
This is because most researchers in the field believe
that since the potential for alcoholism is still part of
the individual’s biological and psychological makeup,
one can never fully recover from alcoholism. The
potential for relapse (returning to illness) is always
there, and must be acknowledged and respected.
Statistics suggest that, among middle-class alcoholics
in stable financial and family situations who have
undergone treatment, 60% or more can be successful
at an attempt to stop drinking for at least a year, and
many for a lifetime.

Prevention
Prevention must begin at a relatively young age
since the first instance of intoxication (drunkenness)
usually occurs during the teenage years. In fact, a 2004
study found that girls experimented with alcohol and
cigarettes at a younger age — 20% by seventh grage —
than boys. It is particularly important that teenagers
who are at high risk for alcoholism—those with a

Alcoholism

After cessation of drinking has been accomplished, the next steps involve helping the patient
avoid ever taking another drink. This phase of treatment is referred to as rehabilitation. The best programs
incorporate the family into the therapy, because the
family has undoubtedly been severely affected by the
patient’s drinking. Some therapists believe that family
members, in an effort to deal with their loved one’s
drinking problem, sometimes develop patterns of
behavior that accidentally support or ‘‘enable’’ the
patient’s drinking. This situation is referred to as
‘‘co-dependence,’’ and must be addressed in order to
successfully treat a person’s alcoholism.

I Aldolase test
Definition
Aldolase is an enzyme found throughout the
body, particularly in muscles. Like all enzymes, it is
needed to trigger specific chemical reactions. Aldolase
106

helps muscle turn sugar into energy. Testing for aldolase is done to diagnose and monitor skeletal muscle
diseases.

Purpose
Skeletal muscle diseases increase the aldolase level
found in a person’s blood. Skeletal muscles are those
muscles attached to bones and whose contractions
make those bones move. When the muscles are diseased or damaged, such as in muscular dystrophy, the
cells deteriorate and break open. The contents of the
cells, including aldolase, spill into the bloodstream.
Measuring the amount of aldolase in the blood indicates the degree of muscle damage.
As muscles continue to deteriorate, aldolase levels
decrease and eventually fall below normal. Less muscle means fewer cells and less aldolase.
Muscle weakness may be caused by neurologic as
well as muscular problems. The measurement of
aldolase levels can help pinpoint the cause. Aldolase
levels will be normal where muscle weakness is caused
by neurological disease, such as poliomyelitis or
multiple sclerosis, but aldolase levels will be elevated
in cases of muscular disease, such as muscular
dystrophy.
Aldolase is also found in the liver and cardiac
muscle of the heart. Damage or disease to these
organs, such as chronic hepatitis or a heart attack,
will also increase aldolase levels in the blood, but to a
lesser degree.

Description
Aldolase is measured by mixing a person’s serum
with a substance with which aldolase is known to
trigger a reaction. The end product of this reaction is
measured, and, from that measurement, the amount of
aldolase in the person’s serum is determined.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

I Aldosterone assay
Definition

Preparation
To collect the 5-10 ml of blood needed for this test,
a healthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the patient’s
upper arm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and
inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws
the blood through the needle into an attached tube.
Collection of the sample takes only a few minutes.
The patient should avoid strenuous exercise and
have nothing to eat or drink, except water, for eight to
ten hours before this test.

Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site and the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to
the puncture site until the bleeding stops will reduce
bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve
discomfort.

Normal results
Newborns have the highest normal aldolase levels
and adults the lowest. Normal values will vary based
on the laboratory and the method used.

Abnormal results
As noted, aldolase is elevated in skeletal muscle
diseases, such as muscular dystrophies. Duchenne’s
muscular dystrophy, the most common type of muscular dystrophy, will increase the aldolase level more
than any other disease.
Nondisease conditions that affect the muscle, such
as injury, gangrene, or an infection, can also increase
the aldolase level. Also, strenuous exercise can temporarily increase a person’s aldolase level.
Certain medications can increase the aldolase
level, while others can decrease it. To interpret what
the results of the aldolase test mean, a physician will
evaluate the result, the person’s clinical symptoms,
and other tests that are more specific for muscle
damage and disease.

This test measures the levels of aldosterone, a
hormone produced by the outer part (cortex) of the
two adrenal glands, organs which sit one on top of
each of the kidneys. Aldosterone regulates the
amounts of sodium and potassium in the blood. This
helps maintain water balance and blood volume,
which, in turn, affects blood pressure.

Purpose
Aldosterone measurement is useful in detecting a
condition called aldosteronism, which is caused by
excess secretion of the hormone from the adrenal
glands. There are two types of aldosteronism: primary
and secondary. Primary aldosteronism is most commonly caused by an adrenal tumor, as in Conn’s
syndrome. Idiopathic (of unknown cause) hyperaldosteronism is another type of primary aldosteronism.
Secondary aldosteronism is more common and may
occur with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis with fluid
in the abdominal cavity (ascites), certain kidney diseases, excess potassium, sodium-depleted diet, and
toxemia of pregnancy.
To differentiate primary aldosteronism from secondary aldosteronism, a plasma renin test should be
performed at the same time as the aldosterone assay.
Renin, an enzyme produced in the kidneys, is high in
secondary aldosteronism and low in primary
aldosteronism.

Description
Aldosterone testing can be performed on a blood
sample or on a 24-hour urine specimen. Several factors, including diet, posture (upright or lying down),
and time of day that the sample is obtained can cause
aldosterone levels to fluctuate. Blood samples are
affected by short-term fluctuations. A urine specimen
collected over an entire 24-hour period lessens the
effects of those interfering factors and provides a
more reliable aldosterone measurement.

Preparation
Fasting is not required for either the blood sample
or urine collection, but the patient should maintain a
normal sodium diet (approximately 0.1 oz [3g]/day)
for at least two weeks before either test. The doctor
should decide if drugs that alter sodium, potassium,
and fluid balance (e.g., diuretics, antihypertensives,

steroids, oral contraceptives) should be withheld. The
test will be more accurate if these are suspended at
at least two weeks before the test. Renin inhibitors
(e.g., propranolol) should not be taken one week
before the test, unless permitted by the physician.
The patient should avoid licorice for at least two
weeks before the test, because of its aldosterone-like
effect. Strenuous exercise and stress can increase
aldosterone levels as well. Because the test is usually
performed by a method called radioimmunoassay,
recently administered radioactive medications will
affect test results.
Since posture and body position affect aldosterone, hospitalized patients should remain in an
upright position (at least sitting) for two hours
before blood is drawn. Occasionally blood will be
drawn again before the patient gets out of bed.
Nonhospitalized patients should arrive at the laboratory in time to maintain an upright position for at
least two hours.

Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include
slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting
or feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma (blood accumulating under the puncture site).

Normal results
Normal results are laboratory-specific and also
vary with sodium intake, with time of day, source of
specimen (e.g., peripheral vein, adrenal vein, 24-hour
urine), age, sex, and posture.
Reference ranges for blood include:


supine (lying down): 3-10 ng/dL

upright (sitting for at least two hours): Female:
5-30ng/dL; Male: 6-22 ng/dL.
Reference ranges for urine: 2-80 mg/24 hr.

108

Increased levels of aldosterone are found in Conn’s
disease (aldosterone-producing adrenal tumor), and in
cases of Bartter’s syndrome (a condition in which the
kidneys overexcrete potassium, sodium and chloride,
resulting in low blood levels of potassium and high
blood levels of aldosterone and renin). Among other
conditions, elevated levels are also seen in secondary
aldosteronism, stress, and malignant hypertension.
Decreased levels of aldosterone are found in
aldosterone deficiency, steroid therapy, high-sodium
diets, certain antihypertensive therapies, and
Addison’s disease (an autoimmune disorder).

I Alemtuzumab
Definition
Alemtuzumab is sold as Campath in the United
States. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal
antibody that selectively binds to CD52, a protein
found on the surface of normal and malignant B and
T cells, that is used to reduce the numbers of circulating malignant cells of patients who have B-cell chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL).

Purpose
Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to
treat B-CLL, one of the most prevalent forms of adult
chronic leukemia. It specifically binds CD52, a protein
found on the surface of essentially all B and T cells of
the immune system. By binding the CD52 protein on
the malignant B cells, the antibody targets it for
removal from the circulation. Scientists believe that
alemtuzumab triggers antibody-mediated lysis of the
B cells, a method that the immune system uses to
eliminate foreign cells.
Alemtuzumab has been approved by the FDA for
treatment of refractory B-CLL. For a patient’s disease
to be classified as refractory, both alkylating agents
and fludarabine treatment must have been tried and
failed. Thus, this drug gives patients who have tried all
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Alkylating agent—A chemical that alters the composition of the genetic material of rapidly dividing cells,
such as cancer cells, causing selective cell death;
used as a chemotherapeutic agent to treat B-CLL.
Antibody—A protective protein made by the
immune system in response to an antigen, also
called an immunoglobulin.
Autoimmune—An immune reaction of a patient
against their own cells.
Humanization—Fusing the constant and variable
framework region of one or more human immunoglobulins with the binding region of an animal
immunoglobulin, done to reduce human reaction
against the fusion antibody.
Monoclonal—Genetically engineered antibodies
specific for one antigen.
Tumor lysis syndrome—A side effect of some immunotherapies, like monoclonal antibodies, that lyse

bloodstream with such a quantity of cellular contents.

approved treatments for B-CLL another option. As
most patients with B-CLL are in stage III or IV by the
time both alkylating agents and fludarabine have been
tried, the experience with alemtuzumab treatment are
primarily with those stages of the disease. In clinical
trials, about 30% of patients had a partial response to
the drug, with 2% of these being complete responses.
This antibody has been tested with limited success in the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
(NHL) and for the preparation of patients with various immune cell malignancies for bone marrow
transplantation. There is also a clinical trial ongoing
to test the ability of this antibody to prevent rejection
in kidney transplantation.

Description
Alemtuzumab is produced in the laboratory using
genetically engineered single clones of B-cells. Like all
antibodies, it is a Y-shaped molecule can bind one
particular substance, the antigen for that monoclonal
antibody. For alemtuzumab, the antigen is CD52, a
protein found on the surface of normal and malignant
B and T cells as well as other cells of the immune and
male reproductive systems. Alemtuzumab is a humanized antibody, meaning that the regions that bind
CD52, located on the tips of the Y branches, are
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

derived from rat antibodies, but the rest of the antibody is human sequence. The presence of the human
sequences helps to reduce the immune response by the
patient against the antibody itself, a problem seen
when complete mouse antibodies are used for cancer
therapies. The human sequences also help to ensure
that the various cell-destroying mechanisms of the
human immune system are properly triggered with
binding of the antibody.
Alemtuzumab was approved in May of 2001 for the
treatment of refractory B-CLL. It is approved for use
alone but clinical trials have tested the ability of the antibody to be used in combination with the purine analogs
pentostatin, fludarabine, and cladribine, and rituximab,
a monoclonal antibody specific for the CD20 antigen,
another protein found on the surface of B cells.

Recommended dosage
This antibody should be administered in a gradually escalating pattern at the start of treatment and any
time administration is interrupted for seven or more
days. The recommended beginning dosage for B-CLL
patients is a daily dose of 3 mg of Campath administered as a two-hour IV infusion. Once this amount is
tolerated, the dose is increased to 10 mg per day. After
tolerating this dose, it can be increased to 30 mg, administered three days a week. Acetominophen and diphenhydramine hydrochoride are given thirty to sixty
minutes before the infusion to help reduce side effects.
Additionally, patients generally receive anti-infective medication before treatment to help minimize the
serious opportunistic infections that can result from this
treatment. Specifically, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(to prevent bacterial infections) and famciclovir (to prevent viral infections) were used during the clinical trial to
decrease infections, although they were not eliminated.

Precautions
Blood studies should be done on a weekly basis while
patients are receiving the alemtuzumab treatment.
Vaccination during the treatment session is not recommended, given the T cell depletion that occurs during
treatment. Furthermore, given that antibodies like alumtuzumab can pass through the placenta to the developing
fetus and in breast milk, use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended unless clearly needed.

Side effects
A severe side effect of alemtuzumab treatment is
the possible depletion of one or more types of blood

cells. Because CD52 is expressed on a patient’s normal
B and T cells, as well as on the surface of the abnormal
B cells, the treatment eliminates both normal and
cancerous cells. The treatment also seems to trigger
autoimmune reactions against various other blood
cells. This results in severe reduction of the many
circulating blood cells including red blood cells (anemia), white blood cells (neutropenia), and clotting cells
(thrombopenia). These conditions are treated with
blood transfusions. The great majority of patients
treated exhibit some type of blood cell depletion.
A second serious side effect of this drug is the
prevalence of opportunistic infections that occurs during the treatment. Serious, and sometimes fatal bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoan infections have
been reported. Treatments to prevent pneumonia and
herpes infections reduce, but do not eliminate these
infections.
The majority of other side effects occur after or
during the first infusion of the drug. Some common
side effects of this drug include fever and chills, nausea
and vomiting, diarrhea, shortness of breath, skin rash,
and unusual fatigue. This drug can also cause low
blood pressure (hypotension).
In patients with high tumor burden (a large number of circulating malignant B cells) this drug can
cause a side effect called tumor lysis syndrome.
Thought to be due to the release of the lysed cells’
contents into the blood stream, it can cause a misbalance of urea, uric acid, phosphate, potassium, and
calcium in the urine and blood. Patients at risk for
this side effect must keep hydrated and can be given
allopurinol before infusion.

Purpose
Because the Alexander technique helps students
improve overall functioning, both mental and physical, it offers a wide range of benefits. Nikolaas
Tinbergen, in his 1973 Nobel lecture, hailed the ‘‘striking improvements in such diverse things as high blood
pressure, breathing, depth of sleep, overall cheerfulness and mental alertness, resilience against outside
pressures, and the refined skill of playing a musical
instrument.’’ He went on to quote a list of other conditions helped by the Alexander technique: ‘‘rheumatism, including various forms of arthritis, then
respiratory troubles, and even potentially lethal
asthma; following in their wake, circulation defects,
which may lead to high blood pressure and also to
some dangerous heart conditions; gastrointestinal disorders of many types, various gynecological conditions, sexual failures, migraines and depressive states.’’
Literature in the 1980s and 1990s went on to
include improvements in back pain, chronic pain, postural problems, repetitive strain injury, benefits during
pregnancy and childbirth, help in applying physical
therapy and rehabilitative exercises, improvements in
strain caused by computer use, improvements in the
posture and performance of school children, and
improvements in vocal and dramatic performance
among the benefits offered by the technique.

I Alexander technique
Definition
The Alexander technique is a somatic method
for improving physical and mental functioning.
Excessive tension, which Frederick Alexander, the
originator, recognized as both physical and mental,
110

restricts movement and creates pressure in the joints,
the spine, the breathing mechanism, and other organs.
The goal of the technique is to restore freedom and
expression to the body and clear thinking to the mind.

Origins
Frederick Matthias Alexander was born in 1869 in
Tasmania, Australia. He became an actor and
Shakespearean reciter, and early in his career he
began to suffer from strain on his vocal chords. He
sought medical attention for chronic hoarseness, but
after treatment with a recommended prescription and
extensive periods of rest, his problem persisted.
Alexander realized that his hoarseness began
about an hour into a dramatic performance and
reasoned that it was something he did in the process
of reciting that caused him to lose his voice. Returning
to his medical doctor, Alexander told him of his
observation. When the doctor admitted that he
didn’t know what Alexander was doing to injure
his vocal chords, Alexander decided to try and find
out for himself.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Direction—Bringing about the free balance of the
head on the spine and the resulting release of the
erector muscles of the back and legs which establish improved coordination.
Habit—Referring to the particular set of physical
and mental tensions present in any individual.
Inhibition—Referring to the moment in an
Alexander lesson when the student refrains from
beginning a movement in order to avoid tensing
of the muscles.
Sensory awareness—Bringing attention to the sensations of tension and/or release in the muscles.

Thus began a decade of self-observation and discovery. Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself in
the act of reciting, normal speaking, and later standing,
walking, and sitting, Alexander managed to improve
his coordination and to overcome his vocal problems.
One of his most startling discoveries was that in order to
change the way he used his body he had to change the
way he was thinking, redirecting his thoughts in such a
way that he did not produce unnecessary tension
when he attempted speech or movement. After making
this discovery at the end of the nineteenth century,
Alexander became a pioneer in body-mind medicine.
At first, performers and dancers sought guidance
from Alexander to overcome physical complaints and
to improve the expression and spontaneity of their
performances. Soon a great number of people sought
help from his teaching for a variety of physical and
mental disorders.
The Alexander technique is primarily taught oneon-one in private lessons. Introductory workshops or
workshops for special applications of the technique
(e.g.,workshops for musicians) are also common.
Private lessons range from a half-hour to an hour in
length, and are taught in a series. The number of lessons
varies according to the severity of the student’s difficulties with coordination or to the extent of the student’s
interest in pursuing the improvements made possible by
continued study. The cost of lessons ranges from $40-80
per hour. Insurance coverage is not widely available,
but discounts are available for participants in some
complementary care insurance plans. Pre-tax Flexible
Spending Accounts for health care cover Alexander
technique lessons if they are prescribed by a physician.
In lessons teachers guide students through simple
movements (while students are dressed in comfortable
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

clothing) and use their hands to help students identify
and stop destructive patterns of tension. Tensing
arises from mental processes as well as physical, so
discussions of personal reactions or behavior are likely
to arise in the course of a lesson.
The technique helps students move with ease and
improved coordination. At the beginning of a movement (the lessons are a series of movements), most people pull back their heads, raise their shoulders toward
their ears, over-arch their lower backs, tighten their legs,
and otherwise produce excessive tension in their bodies.
Alexander referred to this as misuse of the body.
At any point in a movement, proper use can be
established. If the neck muscles are not over-tensed,
the head will carry slightly forward of the spine, simply
because it is heavier in the front. When the head is out
of balance in the forward direction, it sets off a series
of stretch reflexes in the extensor muscles of the back.
It is skillful use of these reflexes, along with reflex
activity in the feet and legs, the arms and hands, the
breathing mechanism, and other parts of the body,
that lessons in the technique aim to develop.
Alexander found that optimal functioning of the
body was very hard to maintain, even for the short
period of time it took to complete a single movement.
People, especially adults, have very strong tension
habits associated with movement. Chronic misuse of
the muscles is common. It may be caused by slouching
in front of televisions or video monitors, too much
sitting or driving and too little walking, or by tension
associated with past traumas and injuries. Stiffening
the neck after a whiplash injury or favoring a broken or
sprained leg long after it has healed are examples of
habitual tension caused by injury.
The first thing a teacher of the Alexander technique does is to increase a student’s sensory awareness
of this excessive habitual tension, particularly that in
the neck and spine. Next the student is taught to
inhibit the tension. If the student prepares to sit
down, for example, he will tense his muscles in his
habitual way. If he is asked to put aside the intention
to sit and instead to free his neck and allow less constriction in his muscles, he can begin to change his
tense habitual response to sitting.
By leaving the head resting on the spine in its
natural free balance, by keeping eyes open and
focused, not held in a tense stare, by allowing the
shoulders to release, the knees to unlock and the
back to lengthen and widen, a student greatly reduces
strain. In Alexander lessons students learn to direct
themselves this way in activity and become skilled in
fluid, coordinated movement.

Side effects

BOOKS

The focus of the Alexander technique is educational. Teachers use their hands simply to gently guide
students in movement. Therefore, both contraindications and potential physiological side effects are kept
to a minimum. No forceful treatment of soft tissue or
bony structure is attempted, so damage to tissues, even
in the case of errors in teaching, is unlikely.
As students’ sensory awareness develops in the
course of Alexander lessons, they become more
acutely aware of chronic tension patterns. As students
learn to release excessive tension in their muscles and
to sustain this release in daily activity, they may
experience tightness or soreness in the connective tissue. This is caused by the connective tissue adapting to
the lengthened and released muscles and the expanded
range of movement in the joints.
Occasionally students may get light-headed during a lesson as contracted muscles release and effect
the circulatory or respiratory functioning.
Forceful contraction of muscles and rigid postures often indicate suppression of emotion. As muscles release during or after an Alexander lesson,
students may experience strong surges of emotion or
sudden changes in mood. In some cases, somatic memories surface, bringing to consciousness past injury or
trauma. This can cause extreme anxiety, and referrals
may be made by the teacher for counseling.

I Alkaline phosphatase test
Definition
Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme found
throughout the body. Like all enzymes, it is needed,
in small amounts, to trigger specific chemical reactions. When it is present in large amounts, it may
signify bone or liver disease or a tumor.

Research and general acceptance
Alexander became well known among the intellectual, artistic, and medical communities in London,
England, during the first half of the twentieth century.
Among Alexander’s supporters were John Dewey,
Aldous Huxley, Bernard Shaw, and renowned scientists Raymond Dart, G.E. Coghill, Charles
Sherrington, and Nikolaas Tinbergen.
Researchers continue to study the effects and
applications of the technique in the fields of education,
preventive medicine, and rehabilitation. The
Alexander technique has proven an effective treatment
for reducing stress, for improving posture and performance in schoolchildren, for relieving chronic pain,
and for improving psychological functioning. The
technique has been found to be as effective as betablocker medications in controlling stress responses in
professional musicians, to enhance respiratory function in normal adults, and to mediate the effects of
scoliosis in adolescents and adults.
112

Purpose
Medical testing of alkaline phosphatase is concerned with the enzyme that is found in liver, bone,
placenta, and intestine. In a healthy liver, fluid containing alkaline phosphate and other substances is
continually drained away through the bile duct. In a
diseased liver, this bile duct is often blocked, keeping
fluid within the liver. Alkaline phosphatase accumulates and eventually escapes into the bloodstream.
The alkaline phosphatase of the liver is produced by
the cells lining the small bile ducts (ductoles) in the liver.
Its origin differs from that of other enzymes called
aminotransferases. If the liver disease is primarily of
an obstructive nature (cholestatic), i.e. involving the
biliary drainage system, the alkaline phosphatase will
be the first and foremost enzyme elevation. If, on the
other hand, the disease is primarily of the liver cells
(hepatocytes), the aminotransferases will rise prominently. Thus, these enzymes are very useful in

distinguishing the type of liver disease–cholestatic or

Growing bones need alkaline phosphatase. Any
condition of bone growth will cause alkaline phosphatase levels to rise. The condition may be normal, such
as a childhood growth spurt or the healing of a broken
bone; or the condition may be a disease, such as bone
cancer, Paget’s disease, or rickets.
During pregnancy, alkaline phosphatase is made
by the placenta and leaks into the mother’s bloodstream. This is normal. Some tumors, however, start
production of the same kind of alkaline phosphatase
produced by the placenta. These tumors are called
germ cell tumors and include testicular cancer and
certain brain tumors.
Alkaline phosphatase from the intestine is
increased in a person with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis.

Description
Alkaline phosphatase is measured by combining
the person’s serum with specific substances with which
alkaline phosphatase is known to react. The end
product of this reaction is measured; and from that
measurement, the amount of alkaline phosphatase in
the person’s serum is determined.
Each tissue–liver, bone, placenta, and intestine–
produces a slightly different alkaline phosphatase.
These variations are called isoenzymes. In the laboratory, alkaline phosphatase is measured as the total
amount or the amount of each of the the four isoenzymes. The isoenzymes react differently to heat, certain chemicals, and other processes in the laboratory.
Methods to measure them separately are based on
these differences.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The test is covered by insurance when medically
necessary. Results are usually available the next day.

Preparation
To collect the 5-10 ml blood needed for this test, a
healthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the person’s
upper arm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region,
and inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum action
draws the blood through the needle into an attached
tube. Collection of the sample takes only a few minutes.
A person being tested for alkaline phosphatase
should not have anything to eat or drink, except
water, for eight to ten hours before the test. Some
people release alkaline phosphatase from the intestine
into the bloodstream after eating. This will temporarily increase the result of the test.

Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to
the puncture site until the bleeding stops will reduce
bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve
discomfort.

Normal results
Normal results vary by age and by sex. They also
vary based on the laboratory and the method used.

Abnormal results
Bone and liver disease increase alkaline phosphatase more than any other disease, up to five times the
normal level. Irritable bowel disease, germ cell tumors,
and infections involving the liver, such as viral hepatitis and infectious mononucleosis, increase the enzyme
also, but to a lesser degree. Healing bones, pregnancy,
and normal growth in children also increase levels.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis

I Allergic
bronchopulmonary
aspergillosis
Definition
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, or
ABPA, is one of four major types of infections in
humans caused by Aspergillus fungi. ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in asthma patients who
are allergic to this specific fungus.

Description
ABPA is an allergic reaction to a species of
Aspergillus called Aspergillus fumigatus. It is sometimes grouped together with other lung disorders
characterized by eosinophilia–an abnormal increase
of a certain type of white blood cell in the blood–
under the heading of eosinophilic pneumonia. These
disorders are also called hypersensitivity lung
diseases.
ABPA appears to be increasing in frequency in the
United States, although the reasons for the increase
are not clear. The disorder is most likely to occur in
adult asthmatics aged 20-40. It affects males and
females equally.

Causes and symptoms
ABPA develops when the patient breathes air
containing Aspergillus spores. These spores are
found worldwide, especially around riverbanks,
marshes, bogs, forests, and wherever there is wet or
decaying vegetation. They are also found on wet
paint, construction materials, and in air conditioning systems. ABPA is a nosocomial infection,
which means that a patient can get it in a hospital.
When Aspergillus spores reach the bronchi, which
are the branches of the windpipe that lead into the
lungs, the bronchi react by contracting spasmodically. So the patient has difficulty breathing and
usually wheezes or coughs. Many patients with
ABPA also run a low-grade fever and lose their
appetites.
Complications
Patients with ABPA sometimes cough up large
amounts of blood, a condition that is called hemoptysis. They may also develop a serious long-term form of
bronchiectasis, the formation of fibrous tissue in the
lungs. Bronchiectasis is a chronic bronchial disorder
caused by repeated inflammation of the airway, and

marked by the abnormal enlargement of, or damage
to, the bronchial walls. ABPA sometimes occurs as a
complication of cystic fibrosis.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The diagnosis of ABPA is based on a combination
of the patient’s history and the results of blood tests,
sputum tests, skin tests, and diagnostic imaging. The
doctor will be concerned to distinguish between ABPA
and a worsening of the patient’s asthma, cystic fibrosis, or
other lung disorders. There are seven major criteria for
a diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis:


a history of asthma.



an accumulation of fluid in the lung that is visible on
a chest x ray.



bronchiectasis (abnormal stretching, enlarging, or
destruction of the walls of the bronchial tubes).



skin reaction to Aspergillus antigen.



eosinophilia in the patient’s blood and sputum.



Aspergillus precipitins in the patient’s blood.
Precipitins are antibodies that react with the antigen
to form a solid that separates from the rest of the
solution in the test tube.



a high level of IgE in the patient’s blood. IgE refers to
a class of antibodies in blood plasma that activate
allergic reactions to foreign particles.

Other criteria that may be used to support the
diagnosis include the presence of Aspergillus in samples of the patient’s sputum, the coughing up of plugs
of brown mucus, or a late skin reaction to the
Aspergillus antigen.
Laboratory tests
The laboratory tests that are done to obtain this
information include a complete blood count (CBC), a
sputum culture, a blood serum test of IgE levels, and
a skin test for the Aspergillus antigen. In the skin test, a
small amount of antigen is injected into the upper
layer of skin on the patient’s forearm about four
inches below the elbow. If the patient has a high
level of IgE antibodies in the tissue, he or she will
develop what is called a ‘‘wheal and flare’’ reaction
in about 15-20 minutes. A ‘‘wheal and flare’’ reaction
is characterized by the eruption of a reddened, itching
spot on the skin. Some patients with ABPA will
develop the so-called late reaction to the skin test, in
which a red, sore, swollen area develops about six to
eight hours after the initial reaction.
Diagnostic imaging
Chest x rays and CT scans are used to check for
the presence of fluid accumulation in the lungs and
signs of bronchiectasis.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment
ABPA is usually treated with prednisone
(Meticorten) or other corticosteroids taken by mouth,
and with bronchodilators.
Antifungal drugs are not used to treat ABPA
because it is caused by an allergic reaction to
Aspergillus rather than by direct infection of tissue.
Follow-up care
Patients with ABPA should be given periodic checkups with chest x rays and a spirometer test. A spirometer is
an instrument that evaluates the patient’s lung capacity.

Prognosis
Most patients with ABPA respond well to corticosteroid treatment. Others have a chronic course with
gradual improvement over time. The best indicator of
a good prognosis is a long-term fall in the patient’s IgE
level. Patients with lung complications from ABPA
may develop severe airway obstruction.

Prevention
ABPA is difficult to prevent because Aspergillus is
a common fungus; it can be found in the saliva and
sputum of most healthy individuals. Patients with
ABPA can protect themselves somewhat by avoiding
haystacks, compost piles, bogs, marshes, and other
locations with wet or rotting vegetation; by avoiding
construction sites or newly painted surfaces; and by
having their air conditioners cleaned regularly. Some
patients may be helped by air filtration systems for
their bedrooms or offices.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis

Diagnosis

Allergic purpura

I Allergic purpura
Definition
Allergic purpura (AP) is an allergic reaction of
unknown origin causing red patches on the skin and
other symptoms. AP is also called Henoch-Schonlein
purpura, named after the two doctors who first
described it.

Description
‘‘Purpura’’ is a bleeding disorder that occurs when
capillaries rupture, allowing small amounts of blood
to accumulate in the surrounding tissues. In AP, this
occurs because the capillaries are blocked by protein
complexes formed during an abnormal immune reaction. The skin is the most obvious site of reaction, but
the joints, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys are also
often affected.
AP affects approximately 35,000 people in the
United States each year. Most cases are children
between the ages of two and seven. Boys are affected
more often than girls, and most cases occur from late
fall to winter.

Causes and symptoms
Causes
AP is caused by a reaction involving antibodies,
special proteins of the immune system. Antibodies are
designed to bind with foreign proteins, called antigens.
In some situations, antigen-antibody complexes can
become too large to remain suspended in the bloodstream. When this occurs, they precipitate out and
become lodged in the capillaries. This can cause the
capillary to burst, allowing a local hemorrhage.
The source of the antigen causing AP is unknown.
Antigens may be introduced by bacterial or viral
infection. More than 75% of patients report having had
an infection of the throat, upper respiratory tract, or
gastrointestinal system several weeks before the onset
of AP. Other complex molecules can act as antigens
as well, including drugs such as antibiotics or vaccines.
Otherwise harmless substances that stimulate an immune
reaction are known as allergens. Drug allergens that may
cause AP include penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin,
and quinine. Vaccines possibly linked to AP include
those for typhoid, measles, cholera, and yellow fever.
Symptoms
The onset of AP may be preceded by a headache,
fever, and loss of appetite. Most patients first develop

an itchy skin rash. The rash is red, either flat or raised,
and may be small and freckle-like. The rash may also
be larger, resembling a bruise. Rashes become purple
and then rust colored over the course of a day, and
fade after several weeks. Rashes are most common on
the buttocks, abdomen, and lower extremities. Rashes
higher on the body may also occur, especially in
younger children.
Joint pain and swelling is common, especially
in the knees and ankles. Abdominal pain occurs in
almost all patients, along with blood in the body
waste (feces). About half of all patients show blood
in the urine, low urine volume, or other signs of kidney
involvement. Kidney failure may occur due to widespread obstruction of the capillaries in the filtering
structures called glomeruli. Kidney failure develops
in about 5% of all patients, and in 15% of those with
elevated blood or protein in the urine.
Less common symptoms include prolonged headache, fever, and pain and swelling of the scrotum.
Involvement of other organ systems may lead to
heart attack (myocardial infarction), inflammation of
the pancreas (pancreatitis), intestinal obstruction, or
bowel perforation.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of AP is based on the symptoms and
their development, a careful medical history, and
blood and urine tests. X rays or computed tomography scans (CT) may be performed to assess complications in the bowel or other internal organs.

Treatment
Most cases of AP resolve completely without
treatment. Nonetheless, a hospital stay is required
because of the possibility of serious complications.
Non-aspirin pain relievers may be given for joint
pain. Corticosteroids (like prednisone) are sometimes
used, although not all specialists agree on their utility.
Kidney involvement requires monitoring and correction of blood fluids and electrolytes.
Patients with severe kidney complications may
require a kidney biopsy so that tissue can be analyzed.
Even after all other symptoms subside, elevated levels
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Allergic rhinitis

of blood or protein in the urine may persist for months
and require regular monitoring. Hypertension or kidney failure may develop months or even years after the
acute phase of the disease. Kidney failure requires
dialysis or transplantation.

Prognosis
Most people who develop AP become better on
their own after several weeks. About half of all
patients have at least one recurrence. Cases that do
not have kidney complications usually have the best
prognosis.

Inc. Reproduced by permission.)

Definition
Allergic rhinitis, more commonly referred to as
hay fever, is an inflammation of the nasal passages
caused by allergic reaction to airborne substances.

Description
Allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common allergic
condition and one of the most common of all minor
afflictions. It affects between 10-20% of all people in the
United States, and is responsible for 2.5% of all doctor
visits. Antihistamines and other drugs used to treat allergic rhinitis make up a significant fraction of both
prescription and over-the-counter drug sales each year.
There are two types of allergic rhinitis: seasonal
and perennial. Seasonal AR occurs in the spring, summer, and early fall, when airborne plant pollens are at
their highest levels. In fact, the term hay fever is really
a misnomer, since allergy to grass pollen is only one
cause of symptoms for most people. Perennial AR
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

occurs all year and is usually caused by home or workplace airborne pollutants. A person can be affected
by one or both types. Symptoms of seasonal AR are
worst after being outdoors, while symptoms of perennial AR are worst after spending time indoors.
Both types of allergies can develop at any age,
although onset in childhood through early adulthood
is most common. Although allergy to a particular
substance is not inherited, increased allergic sensitivity
may ‘‘run in the family.’’ While allergies can improve
on their own over time, they can also become worse
over time.

microorganisms, or particles, like pollen or dust, by
producing specific proteins, called antibodies, that are
capable of binding to identifying molecules, or antigens,
on the foreign particle. This reaction between antibody
and antigen sets off a series of reactions designed to
protect the body from infection. Sometimes, this same
series of reactions is triggered by harmless, everyday
substances. This is the condition known as allergy,
and the offending substance is called an allergen.
Like all allergic reactions, AR involves a special
set of cells in the immune system known as mast cells.
Mast cells, found in the lining of the nasal passages
and eyelids, display a special type of antibody, called
immunoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside,
mast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets,
called granules. When the antibodies encounter
allergens, they trigger release of the granules, which
spill out their chemicals onto neighboring cells, including blood vessels and nerve cells. One of these
chemicals, histamine, binds to the surfaces of these
other cells, through special proteins called histamine
receptors. Interaction of histamine with receptors on
blood vessels causes neighboring cells to become
leaky, leading to the fluid collection, swelling, and
118

increased redness characteristic of a runny nose and
red, irritated eyes. Histamine also stimulates pain
receptors, causing the itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and
throat common in allergic rhinitis.
The number of possible airborne allergens is
enormous. Seasonal AR is most commonly caused
by grass and tree pollens, since their pollen is produced
in large amounts and is dispersed by the wind. Showy
flowers, like roses or lilacs, that attract insects produce
a sticky pollen that is less likely to become airborne.
Different plants release their pollen at different times
of the year, so seasonal AR sufferers may be most
affected in spring, summer, or fall, depending on
which plants provoke a response. The amount of pollen
in the air is reflected in the pollen count, often broadcast on the daily news during allergy season. Pollen
counts tend to be lower after a good rain that washes
the pollen out of the air and higher on warm, dry,
windy days.
Virtually any type of tree or grass may cause AR.
A few types of weeds that tend to cause the most
trouble for people include the following:


ragweed



sagebrush



lamb’s-quarters



plantain



pigweed



dock/sorrel



tumbleweed

Perennial AR is often triggered by house dust, a
complicated mixture of airborne particles, many of
which are potent allergens. House dust contains
some or all of the following:


house mite body parts. All houses contain large numbers of microscopic insects called house mites. These
harmless insects feed on fibers, fur, and skin shed by
the house’s larger occupants. Their tiny body parts
easily become airborne.



animal dander. Animals constantly shed fur, skin
flakes, and dried saliva. Carried in the air, or transferred from pet to owner by direct contact, dander
can cause allergy in many sensitive people.



mold spores. Molds live in damp spots throughout
the house, including basements, bathrooms, air
ducts, air conditioners, refrigerator drains, damp
windowsills, mattresses, and stuffed furniture.
Mildew and other molds release airborne spores
that circulate throughout the house.

Symptoms

Inflammation of the nose, or rhinitis, is the
major symptom of AR. Inflammation causes itching,
sneezing, runny nose, redness, and tenderness. Sinus
swelling can constrict the eustachian tube that connects the inner ear to the throat, causing a congested
feeling and ‘‘ear popping.’’ The drip of mucus from the
sinuses down the back of the throat, combined with
increased sensitivity, can also lead to throat irritation
and redness. AR usually also causes redness, itching,
and watery eyes. Fatigue and headache are also
common.

Diagnosis
Diagnosing seasonal AR is usually easy and can
often be done without a medical specialist. When
symptoms appear in spring or summer and disappear
with the onset of cold weather, seasonal AR is almost
certainly the culprit. Other causes of rhinitis, including infection, can usually be ruled out by a physical
examination and a nasal smear, in which a sample of
mucus is taken on a swab for examination.
Allergy tests, including skin testing and provocation testing, can help identify the precise culprit,
but may not be done unless a single source is
suspected and subsequent avoidance is possible.
Skin testing involves placing a small amount of
liquid containing a specific allergen on the skin and
then either poking, scratching, or injecting it into
the skin surface to observe whether redness and
swellings occurs. Provocation testing involves challenging an individual with either a small amount of
an inhalable or ingestable allergen to see if a response
is elicited.
Perennial AR can also usually be diagnosed by
careful questioning about the timing of exposure
and the onset of symptoms. Specific allergens can be
identified through allergy skin testing.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment
Avoidance of the allergens is the best treatment,
but this is often not possible. When it is not possible to
avoid one or more allergens, there are two major forms
of medical treatment, drugs and immunotherapy.
Drugs
ANTIHISTAMINES. Antihistamines block the histamine receptors on nasal tissue, decreasing the effect of
histamine release by mast cells. They may be used after
symptoms appear, though they may be even more
effective when used preventively, before symptoms
appear. A wide variety of antihistamines are available.

Older antihistamines often produce drowsiness as
a major side effect. Such antihistamines include the
following:


diphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics)



chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics)



brompheniramine (Dimetane and generics)



clemastine (Tavist and generics).

Newer antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness are available by prescription and include the
following:


astemizole (Hismanal)



fexofenadine (Allegra)



cetirizine (Zyrtec)



azelastin HCl (Astelin).

Loratidine (Claritin) was available only by prescription but was released to over-the-counter status
by the FDA.
Hismanal has the potential to cause serious heart
arrhythmias when taken with the antibiotic erythromycin, the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itraconazole, or the antimalarial drug quinine. Taking more than
the recommended dose of Hismanal can also cause
arrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original nondrowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn from
the market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because
of this potential and because of the availability of an
equally effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.
LEUKOTRIENE RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (montelukast or Singulair
and zafirlukast or Accolate) are a newer class of drugs
used daily to help prevent asthma. They’ve also become
approved in the United States to treat allergic rhinitis.
DECONGESTANTS. Decongestants constrict blood
vessels to counteract the effects of histamine. This
decreases the amount of blood in the nasopahryngeal

119

Allergic rhinitis

Other potential causes of perennial allergic rhinitis include the following:

Allergic rhinitis

and sinus mucosa and reduces swelling. Nasal sprays
are available that can be applied directly to the nasal
lining and oral systemic preparations are available.
Decongestants are stimulants and may cause increased
heart rate and blood pressure, headaches, isomnia,
agitation and difficulty emptying the bladder. Use of
topical decongestants for longer than several days can
cause loss of effectiveness and rebound congestion, in
which nasal passages become more severely swollen
than before treatment.

symptom relief, western herbal remedies including eyebright (Euphrasia officinalis) and nettle (Urtica dioica) may
be helpful. Bee pollen may also be effective in alleviating
or eliminating AR symptoms. A 2004 report said that
phototherapy (treatment with a combination of ultraviolet and visible light) decreased the symptoms of allergic
rhinitis in a majority of patients who did not respond well
to traditional drug treatment.

TOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. Topical corticosteroids reduce mucous membrane inflammation and are
available by prescription. Allergies tend to become
worse as the season progresses because the immune
system becomes sensitized to particular antigens and
can produce a faster, stronger response. Topical
corticosteroids are especially effective at reducing this
seasonal sensitization because they work more slowly
and last longer than most other medication types. As
a result, they are best started before allergy season
begins. Side effects are usually mild, but may include
headaches, nosebleeds, and unpleasant taste sensations.

Most people with AR can achieve adequate relief
with a combination of preventive strategies and treatment. While allergies may improve over time, they
may also get worse or expand to include new allergens.
Early treatment can help prevent an increased sensitization to other allergens.

Prognosis

Prevention
Reducing exposure to pollen may improve symptoms of seasonal AR. Strategies include the following:


stay indoors with windows closed during the morning hours, when pollen levels are highest



keep car windows up while driving



use a surgical face mask when outside



avoid uncut fields



learn which trees are producing pollen in which seasons, and avoid forests at the height of pollen season



wash clothes and hair after being outside



clean air conditioner filters in the home regularly



use electrostatic filters for central air conditioning

MAST CELL STABILIZERS. Cromolyn sodium pre-

vents the release of mast cell granules, thereby preventing release of histamine and the other chemicals
contained in them. It acts as a preventive treatment if it
is begun several weeks before the onset of the allergy
season. It can be used for perennial AR as well.
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy, also known as desensitization or
allergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types in the
body, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to cause allergic
reactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by allergy testing
to determine the precise allergens responsible. Injections
involve very small but gradually increasing amounts of
allergen, over several weeks or months, with periodic
boosters. Full benefits may take up to several years to
achieve and are not seen at all in about one in five
patients. Individuals receiving all shots will be monitored closely following each shot because of the small
risk of anaphylaxis, a condition that can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop in blood pressure.

Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for AR often focus on modulation of the body’s immune response, and
frequently center around diet and lifestyle adjustments.
Chinese herbal medicine can help rebalance a person’s
system, as can both acute and constitutional homeopathic treatment. Vitamin C in substantial amounts can
help stabilize the mucous membrane response. For

I Allergies
Definition
Allergies are abnormal reactions of the immune
system that occur in response to otherwise harmless
substances.

Description
Allergies are among the most common of medical
disorders. It is estimated that 60 million Americans, or
more than one in every five people, suffer from some
form of allergy, with similar proportions throughout
much of the rest of the world. Allergy is the single
largest reason for school absence and is a major source
of lost productivity in the workplace.
An allergy is a type of immune reaction. Normally,
the immune system responds to foreign microorganisms or particles by producing specific proteins called
antibodies. These antibodies are capable of binding
to identifying molecules, or antigens, on the foreign
particle. This reaction between antibody and antigen
sets off a series of chemical reactions designed to protect the body from infection. Sometimes, this same
series of reactions is triggered by harmless, everyday
substances such as pollen, dust, and animal danders.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

When this occurs, an allergy develops against the
offending substance (an allergen.)
Mast cells, one of the major players in allergic
reactions, capture and display a particular type of
antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE) that
binds to allergens. Inside mast cells are small chemical-filled packets called granules. Granules contain a
variety of potent chemicals, including histamine.
Immunologists separate allergic reactions into
two main types: immediate hypersensitivity reactions,
which are predominantly mast cell-mediated and
occur within minutes of contact with allergen; and
delayed hypersensitivity reactions, mediated by
T cells (a type of white blood cells) and occurring
hours to days after exposure.
Inhaled or ingested allergens usually cause
immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Allergens bind
to IgE antibodies on the surface of mast cells, which
spill the contents of their granules out onto neighboring cells, including blood vessels and nerve cells.
Histamine binds to the surfaces of these other cells
through special proteins called histamine receptors.
Interaction of histamine with receptors on blood vessels causes increased leakiness, leading to the fluid
collection, swelling and increased redness. Histamine
also stimulates pain receptors, making tissue more
sensitive and irritable. Symptoms last from one to
several hours following contact.
In the upper airways and eyes, immediate hypersensitivity reactions cause the runny nose and itchy,
bloodshot eyes typical of allergic rhinitis. In the gastrointestinal tract, these reactions lead to swelling and
irritation of the intestinal lining, which causes the
cramping and diarrhea typical of food allergy.
Allergens that enter the circulation may cause hives,
angioedema, anaphylaxis, or atopic dermatitis.
Allergens on the skin usually cause delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Roving T cells contact the allergen, setting in motion a more prolonged immune
response. This type of allergic response may develop
over several days following contact with the allergen,
and symptoms may persist for a week or more.

Causes and symptoms
Allergens enter the body through four main
routes: the airways, the skin, the gastrointestinal
tract, and the circulatory system.


Airborne allergens cause the sneezing, runny nose,
and itchy, bloodshot eyes of hay fever (allergic rhinitis). Airborne allergens can also affect the lining of
the lungs, causing asthma, or conjunctivitis (pink

Allergies

Allergic rhinitis is commonly triggered by
exposure to household dust, animal fur,
or pollen. The foreign substance that
triggers an allergic reaction is called
an allergen.

Pollen grains

The presence of an allergen causes the
body's lymphocytes to begin producing
IgE antibodies. The lymphocytes of an
allergy sufferer produce an unusually
large amount of IgE.

In a future exposure to the same substance,
the antibodies on the mast cells bind to the
allergens, and the cells release their histamine.

SECOND EXPOSURE

Histamine travels to receptor sites in the nasal
passages. When histamine molecules enter the
sites they trigger dilation of the blood vessels,
swelling, irritation, and increased production
of mucus.

Antihistamine drugs block histamine molecules
from entering receptor sites, thus preventing or

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Allergen—A substance that provokes an allergic
response.
Allergic rhinitis—Inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose and eyes in response to an
allergen.
Anaphylaxis—Increased sensitivity caused by previous exposure to an allergen that can result in
blood vessel dilation and smooth muscle contraction. Anaphylaxis can result in sharp blood pressure
drops and difficulty breathing.
Angioedema—Severe non-inflammatory swelling of
the skin, organs, and brain that can also be accompanied by fever and muscle pain.
Antibody—A specific protein produced by the
immune system in response to a specific foreign
protein or particle called an antigen.



Delayed hypersensitivity reactions—Allergic reactions mediated by T cells that occur hours to days
after exposure.
Granules—Small packets of reactive chemicals
stored within cells.
Histamine—A chemical released by mast cells that
activates pain receptors and causes cells to become
leaky.

Asthma—A lung condition in which the airways
become narrow due to smooth muscle contraction,
causing wheezing, coughing, and shortness of
breath.
Atopic dermatitis—Infection of the skin as a result of
exposure to airborne or food allergens.

Immune hypersensitivity reaction—Allergic reactions that are mediated by mast cells and occur
within minutes of allergen contact.
Mast cells—A type of immune system cell that is
found in the lining of the nasal passages and eyelids,
displays a type of antibody called immunoglobulin

eye). Exposure to cockroach allergens has been associated with the development of asthma. Airborne
allergens from household pets are another common
source of environmental exposure.

Dermatitis may arise from an allergic response (such
as from poison ivy), or exposure to an irritant causing nonimmune damage to skin cells (such as soap,
cold, and chemical agents).

Antigen—A foreign protein to which the body reacts
by making antibodies.



Conjunctivitis—Inflammation of the thin lining of
the eye called the conjunctiva.
Contact dermatitis—Inflammation of the skin as a
result of contact with a substance.

Allergens in food can cause itching and swelling of
the lips and throat, cramps, and diarrhea. When
absorbed into the bloodstream, they may cause
hives (urticaria) or more severe reactions involving
recurrent, non-inflammatory swelling of the skin,
mucous membranes, organs, and brain (angioedema). Some food allergens may cause anaphylaxis,
a potentially life-threatening condition marked by
tissue swelling, airway constriction, and drop in
blood pressure. Allergies to foods such as cow’s
milk, eggs, nuts, fish, and legumes (peanuts and soybeans) are common. Allergies to fruits and vegetables may also occur.
In contact with the skin, allergens can cause reddening, itching, and blistering, called contact dermatitis.
Skin reactions can also occur from allergens introduced through the airways or gastrointestinal tract.
This type of reaction is known as atopic dermatitis.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



Injection of allergens, from insect bites and stings or
drug administration, can introduce allergens directly
into the circulation, where they may cause systemwide responses (including anaphylaxis), as well as
the local ones of swelling and irritation at the injection site.

People with allergies are not equally sensitive to
all allergens. Some may have severe allergic rhinitis
but no food allergies, for instance, or be extremely
sensitive to nuts but not to any other food. Allergies
may get worse over time. For example, childhood ragweed allergy may progress to year-round dust and
pollen allergy. On the other hand, a person may lose
allergic sensitivity. Infant or childhood atopic dermatitis disappears in almost all people. More commonly,
what seems to be loss of sensitivity is instead a reduced
exposure to allergens or an increased tolerance for the
same level of symptoms.

Allergies

KEY TERMS

Allergies

While allergy to specific allergens is not inherited, the
likelihood of developing some type of allergy seems to be,
at least for many people. If neither parent has allergies,
the chances of a child developing allergy is approximately
10-20%; if one parent has allergies, it is 30-50%; and if
both have allergies, it is 40-75%. One source of this
genetic predisposition is in the ability to produce higher
levels of IgE in response to allergens. Those who produce
more IgE will develop a stronger allergic sensitivity.
COMMON ALLERGENS. The most common airborne allergens are the following:


plant pollens



animal fur and dander



body parts from house mites (microscopic creatures
found in all houses)



house dust



mold spores



cigarette smoke



solvents



cleaners
Common food allergens include the following:

The following types of drugs commonly cause
allergic reactions:


penicillin or other antibiotics



flu vaccines



tetanus toxoid vaccine



gamma globulin

Common causes of contact dermatitis include the
following:


poison ivy, oak, and sumac



nickel or nickel alloys



latex

Insects and other arthropods whose bites or stings
typically cause allergy include the following:


bees, wasps, and hornets



mosquitoes



fleas



scabies

Symptoms depend on the specific type of allergic
reaction. Allergic rhinitis is characterized by an itchy,
runny nose, often with a scratchy or irritated throat
due to post-nasal drip. Inflammation of the thin membrane covering the eye (allergic conjunctivitis) causes
redness, irritation, and increased tearing in the eyes.
Asthma causes wheezing, coughing, and shortness of
124

breath. Symptoms of food allergies depend on the
tissues most sensitive to the allergen and whether the
allergen was spread systemically by the circulatory
system. Gastrointestinal symptoms may include swelling and tingling in the lips, tongue, palate or throat;
nausea; cramping; diarrhea; and gas. Contact dermatitis is marked by reddened, itchy, weepy skin blisters,
and an eczema that is slow to heal. It sometimes has a
characteritic man-made pattern, such as a glove
allergy with clear demarkation on the hands, wrist,
and arms where the gloves are worn, or on the earlobes
by wearing earrings.
Whole body or systemic reactions may occur from
any type of allergen, but are more common following
ingestion or injection of an allergen. Skin reactions
include the raised, reddened, and itchy patches called
hives that characteristically blanch with pressure and
resolve within twenty-four hours. A deeper and more
extensive skin reaction, involving more extensive fluid
collection and pain, is called angioedema. This usually
occurs on the extremities, fingers, toes, and parts of the
head, neck, and face. Anaphylaxis is marked by airway
constriction, blood pressure drop, widespread tissue
swelling, heart rhythm abnormalities, and in some
cases, loss of consciousness. Other syptoms may
include, dizziness, weakness, seizures, coughing, flushing, or cramping. The symptoms may begin within five
minutes after exposure to the allergen up to one hour
or more later. Mast cells in the tissues and basophils in
the blood release mediators that give rise to the clinical
symptoms of this IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Commonly, this is associated with allergies to
medications, foods, and insect venoms. In some individuals, anaphylaxis can occur with exercise, plasma
exchange, hemodialysis, reaction to insulin, contrast
media used in certain types of medical tests, and rarely
during the administration of local anesthetics.

Diagnosis
Allergies can often be diagnosed by a careful medical history, matching the onset of symptoms to the
exposure to possible allergens. Allergy is suspected if
the symptoms presented are characteristic of an allergic reaction and this occurs repeatedly upon exposure
to the suspected allergen. Allergy tests can be used to
identify potential allergens, but these must be supported by eveidence of allergic responses in the
patient’s clinical history.
Skin tests
Skin tests are performed by administering a tiny
dose of the suspected allergen by pricking, scratching,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Allergen-Specific IgE Measurement
Tests that measure allergen-specific IgE antibodies generally follow a basic method. The allergen is
bound to a solid support, either in the form of a
cellulose sponge, microtiter plate, or paper disk. The
patient’s serum is prepared from a blood sample and is
incubated with the solid phase. If allergen specific IgE
antibodies are present, they will bind to the solid phase
and be retained there when the rest of the serum is
washed away. Next, an labeled antibody against the
IgE is added and will bind to any IgE on the solid
phase. The excess is washed away and the levels of IgE
are determined. The commonly used RAST test (radio
allergo sorbent test) employed radio-labeled Anti-IgE
antibodies. Updated methods now incorporate the use
of enyzme-labeled antibodies in ELISA assays
(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays).
Total Serum IgE
The total level of IgE in the serum is commonly
measured with a two-site immunometric assay. Some
research indicates that there is a higher level of total
serum IgE in allergic as compared to non-allergic
people. However, this may not always be the case as
there is considerable overlap between the two groups.
This test is useful for the diagnosis of allergic fungal
sinusitis and bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Other
conditions that are not allergic in nature may give
rise to higher IgE levels such as smoking, AIDS, infection with parasites, and IgE myeloma.
Provocation tests
These tests involve the administration of allergen to
elicit an immune response. Provocation tests, most commonly done with airborne allergens, present the allergen
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

directly through the route normally involved. Delayed
allergic contact dermatitis diagnosis involves similar
methods by application of a skin patch with allergen
to induce an allergic skin reaction. Food allergen provocation tests require abstinence from the suspect allergen
for two weeks or more, followed by ingestion of a
measured amount of the test substance administered as
an opaque capsule along with a placebo control.
Provocation tests are not used if anaphylaxis is is a
concern due to the patient’s medical history.
Future diagnostic methods
Attempts have been made for direct measurement
of immune mediators such as histamine, eosinophil
cationic protein (ECP), and mast cell tryptase.
Another, somewhat controversial,test is electrodermal
testing or electro-acupuncture allergy testing. This test
has been used in Europe and is under investigation in
the United States, though not approved by the Food
and Drug Administration. An electric potential is
applied to the skin, the allergen presented, and the
electrical resistance observed for changes. This
method has not been verified.

Treatment
Avoiding allergens is the first line of defense to
reduce the possibility of an allergic attack. It is helpful
to avoid environmental irritants such as tobacco
smoke, perfumes, household cleaning agents, paints,
glues, air fresheners, and potpourri. Nitrogen dioxide
from poorly vented gas stoves, woodburning stoves,
and artificial fireplaces has also been linked to poor
asthma control. Dust mite control is particularly
important in the bedroom areas by use of allergenimpermeable covers on mattress and pillows, frequent
washing of bedding in hot water, and removal of items
that collect dust such as stuffed toys. Mold growth may
be reduced by lowering indoor humidity, repair of
house foundations to reduce indoor leaks and seepage,
and installing exhaust systems to ventilate areas where
steam is generated such as the bathroom or kitchen.
Allergic individuals should avoid pet allergens such as
saliva, body excretions, pelts, urine, or feces. For those
who insist on keeping a pet, restriction of the animal’s
activity to certain areas of the home may be beneficial.
Complete environmental control is often difficult
to accomplish, hence therapuetic interventions may
become necessary. A large number of prescription
and over-the-counter drugs are available for treatment
of immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Most of these
work by decreasing the ability of histamine to provoke
symptoms. Other drugs counteract the effects of
125

Allergies

puncturing or injecting the skin. The allergen is
applied to the skin as an auqeous extract, usually on
the back, forearms, or top of the thighs. Once in the
skin, the allergen may produce a classic immune wheal
and flare response (a skin lesion with a raised, white,
compressible area surrounded by a red flare). The tests
usually begin with prick tests or patch tests that expose
the skin to small amounts of allergen to observe the
response. A positive reaction will occur on the skin
even if the allergen is at levels normally encountered in
food or in the airways. Reactions are usually evaluated
approximately fifteen minutes after exposure.
Intradermal skin tests involved injection of the allergen into the dermis of the skin. These tests are more
sensitive and are used for allergies associated with risk
of death, such as allergies to antibiotics.

Allergies

histamine by stimulating other systems or reducing
immune responses in general.
Antihistamines
Antihistamines block the histamine receptors on
nasal tissue, decreasing the effect of histamine released
by mast cells. They may be used after symptoms appear,
though they may be even more effective when used
preventively, before symptoms appear. Antihistamines
help reduce sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea. A wide
variety of antihistamines are available.
Older, first generation antihistamines often produce drowsiness as a major side effect, as well as dry
mouth, tachycardia, blurred vision, constipation, and
lower the threshold for seizures. These medications
also have similar effects to a alcohol and care should
be taken when operating motor vehicles, as individuals
may not be aware that they are impaired. Such antihistamines include the following:


diphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics)



chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics)



brompheniramine (Dimetane and generics)



clemastine (Tavist and generics)

Newer antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness or pass the blood-brain barrier are available by
prescription and include the following:


loratidine (Claritin)



cetirizine (Zyrtec)



fexofenadine (Allegra)

Desloratadine (Clarinex) was approved in 2004 in
syrup form for children two years and older for seasonal allergies and for hives of unknown cause in children as young as six months. It is the only nonsedating
antihistamine approved as of 2004 for children as
young as six months.
Hismanal has the potential to cause serious heart
arrhythmias when taken with the antibiotic erythromycin, the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itraconazole,
or the antimalarial drug quinine. Taking more than the
recommended dose of Hismanal can also cause
arrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original nondrowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn from
the market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because of
this potential and because of the availability of an
equally effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.
Decongestants
Decongestants constrict blood vessels to the
mucosa to counteract the effects of histamine. This
126

decreases the amount of blood in the nasopahryngeal
and sinus mucosa and reduces swelling. Nasal sprays
are available that can be applied directly to the nasal
lining and oral systematic preparations are available.
Decongestants are stimulants and may cause increased
heart rate and blood pressure, headaches, insomnia,
agitation, and difficulty emptying the bladder. Use of
topical decongestants for longer than several days can
cause loss of effectiveness and rebound congestion,
in which nasal passages become more severely swollen
than before treatment.
Topical corticosteroids
Topical corticosteroids reduce mucous membrane
inflammation by decreasing the amount of fluid moved
from the vascular spaces into the tissues. These medications reduce the recruitment of inflammatory cells as
well as the synthesis of cytokines. They are available by
prescription. Allergies tend to become worse as the
season progresses because the immune system becomes
sensitized to particular antigens and can produce a
faster, stronger response. Topical corticosteroids are
especially effective at reducing this seasonal sensitization because they work more slowly and last longer
than most other medication types. As a result, they
are best started before allergy season begins. Side
effects are usually mild, but may include headaches,
nosebleeds, and unpleasant taste sensations.
Bronchodilators or metered-dose inhalers (MDI)
Because allergic reactions involving the lungs
cause the airways or bronchial tubes to narrow, as in
asthma, bronchodilators, which cause the smooth muscle lining the airways to open or dilate, can be very
effective. When inhalers are used, it is important that
the patient be educated in the proper use of these
medications. The inhaler should be shaken, and the
patient should breathe out to expel air from the lungs.
The inhaler should be placed at least two fingerbreadths in front of the mouth. The medication should
be aimed at the back of the throat, and the inhaler
activated while breathing in quite slowly 3-4 seconds.
The breath should be held for at least ten seconds, and
then expelled. At least thirty to sixty seconds should
pass before the inhaler is used again. Care should be
taken to properly wash out the mouth and brush the
teeth following use, as residual medication remains in
this area with only a small amount actually reaching
the lungs. Some bronchodilators used to treat acute
asthma attacks include adrenaline, albuterol, Maxair,
Proventil, or other ‘‘adrenoceptor stimulants,’’ most
often administered as aerosols. Successfully managing
asthma and allergies can reduce the use of inhalers.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Anticholinergics
Ipratropium bromide (atrovent) and atropine sulfate are achticholinergic drugs used for the treatment
of asthma. Ipratropium is used for treating asthmatics
in emergency situations with a nebulizer.
Nonsteroidal drugs
MAST CELL STABILIZERS. Cromolyn sodium prevents the release of mast cell granules, thereby preventing the release of histamine and other chemicals
contained in them. It acts as a preventive treatment if it
is begun several weeks before the onset of the allergy
season. It can also be used for year round allergy
prevention. Cromolyn sodium is available as a nasal
spray for allergic rhinitis and in aerosol (a suspension
of particles in gas) form for asthma.
LEUKOTRIENE MODIFIERS. These medications are

useful for individuals with aspirin sensitivity, sinusitis,
polposis, urticaria. Examples include zafirlukast
(Accolate), montelukast (Singulair), and zileuton
(Zyflo). When zileuton is used, care must be taken to
measure liver enzymes.
Immunotherapy
In this form of therapy, allergen is injected into the
skin in increasing doses over a specific period of time.
This may be helpful for patients who do not respond to
medications or avoidance of allergens in the environment. This type of therapy may reduce the need for
medications. A 2004 study recommended that children
who have severe reactions to insect sting receive immunotherapy to protect them against future stings.
Treatment of contact dermatitis
An individual suffering from contact dermatitis
should initially take steps to avoid possible sources of
exposure to the offending agent. Calamine lotion
applied to affected skin can reduce irritation somewhat,
as can cold water compresses. Side effects of topical
agents may include over-drying of the skin. In the case
of acute contact dermatitis, short-term oral corticosteroid therapy may be appropriate. Moderately strong
coricosteroids can also be applied as a wrap for twentyfour hours. Health care workers are especially at risk
for hand eruptions due to glove use.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment of anaphylaxis
The emergency condition of anaphylaxis is treated
with injection of adrenaline, also known as epinephrine. People who are prone to anaphylaxis because
of food or insect allergies often carry an ‘‘Epi-pen’’
containing adrenaline in a hypodermic needle. Other
medications may be given to aid the action of the epipen. Prompt injection can prevent a more serious
reaction from developing. Particular care should be
taken to assess the affected individual’s airway status,
and he or she should be placed in a recumbent pose
and vital signs determined. If a reaction resulted from
insect sting or an injection, a tourniquet may need
to be placed proximal to the area where the agent
penetrated the skin. This should then be released at
intervals of ten minutes at a time, for one to two
minutes duration. If the individual does not respond
to such interventions, then emergency treatment is
appropriate.

Alternative treatment
Any alternative treatment for allergies begins with
finding the cause and then helping the patient to avoid
or eliminate the allergen, although this is not always
possible. As with any alternative therapy, a physician
should be consulted before initiating a new form of
treatment. Education on the use of alternative agents
is critical, as they are still ‘‘drugs’’ even though they
are derived from natural sources. Various categories
of alternative remedies may be helpful in allergy treatment, including:


antihistamines: vitamin C and the bioflavonoid
hesperidin act as natural anithistamines.



decongestants: vitamin C, the homeopathic remedies Ferrum phosphoricum and Kali muriaticum
(used alternately), and the dietary supplement
N-acetylcysteine are believed to have decongestant effects.



mast cell stabilizers: the bioflavonoids quercetin and
hesperidin may help stabilize mast cells.



immunotherapy: the herbs echinacea (Echinacea
spp.) and astragalus or milk-vetch root (Astragalus
membranaceus) may possibly help to strengthen the
immune system.



bronchodilators: the herbal remedies ephedra
(Ephedra sinica, also known as ma huang in traditional Chinese medicine), khellin (Ammi visnaga) and
cramp bark (Viburnum opulus) are believed to help
open the airways.

127

Allergies

This is done through good communication between
the physician and patient, self-management with written action plans, avoiding allergy triggers, and
through the use of preventive medications such as
montelukast.

Allergy tests

Treatment of contact dermatitis
A variety of herbal remedies, either applied topically or taken internally, may possibly assist in the
treatment of contact dermatitis. A poultice (crushed
herbs applied directly to the affected area) made of
jewelweed (Impatiens spp.) or chickweed (Stellaria
media) may soothe the skin. A cream or wash containing calendula (Calendula officinalis), a natural antiseptic and anti-inflammatory agent, may help heal the
rash when applied topically. Homeopathic treatment
may include such remedies as Rhus toxicodendron,
Apis mellifica, or Anacardium taken internally. A
qualified homeopathic practitioner should be consulted to match the symptoms with the correct remedy.
Care should be taken with any agent taken internally.

Prognosis
Allergies can improve over time, although they
often worsen. While anaphylaxis and severe asthma
are life-threatening, other allergic reactions are not.
Learning to recognize and avoid allergy-provoking
situations allows most people with allergies to lead
normal lives.

Prevention
Avoiding allergens is the best means of limiting
allergic reactions. For food allergies, there is no effective
treatment except avoidance. By determining the allergens that are causing reactions, most people can learn to
avoid allergic reactions from food, drugs, and contact
allergens such as poison ivy or latex. The government
will help now, since passing the Food Allergen Labeling
and Consumer Protection Act in 2004. Beginning
January 1, 2006, food manufacturers will be required
to clearly state if a product contains any of the eight
major food allergens that are responsible for more than
90% of allergic reactions to foods. These are milk,
eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, wheat, and soy.
Airborne allergens are more difficult to avoid,
although keeping dust and animal dander from collecting in the house may limit exposure. Cromolyn
sodium can prevent mast cell degranulation, thereby
limiting the allergic response.
Immunotherapy, also known as desensitization or
allergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types in
the body, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to cause
allergic reactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by
allergy testing to determine the precise allergens
responsible. Injections involve very small but gradually increasing amounts of allergen, over several weeks
or months, with periodic boosters. Full benefits may
128

take up to several years to achieve and are not seen at
all in about one in five patients. Individuals receiving
all shots will be monitored closely following each shot
because of the small risk of anaphylaxis, a condition
that can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop
in blood pressure.
Other drugs, such as leukotriene modifiers, are
used to prevent asthma attacks and in the long-term
management of allergies and asthma.

I Allergy tests
Definition
Allergy tests indicate a person’s allergic sensitivity
to commonly encountered environmental substances.

Purpose
Allergy is a reaction of the immune system.
Normally, the immune system responds to foreign
microorganisms and particles, like pollen or dust,
by producing specific proteins called antibodies that
are capable of binding to identifying molecules, or
antigens, on the foreign organisms. This reaction
between antibody and antigen sets off a series of
reactions designed to protect the body from infection. Sometimes, this same series of reactions is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

triggered by harmless, everyday substances. This is
the condition known as allergy, and the offending
substance is called an allergen. Common inhaled
allergens include pollen, dust, and insect parts from
tiny house mites. Common food allergens include
nuts, fish, and milk.
Allergic reactions involve a special set of cells
in the immune system known as mast cells. Mast
cells serve as guards in the tissues where the body
meets the outside world: the skin, the mucous
membranes of the eyes and other areas, and the linings of the respiratory and digestive systems. Mast
cells display a special type of antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside,
mast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets,
called granules. When the antibodies encounter allergens, they trigger the release of granules, which spill
out their chemicals onto neighboring cells, including
blood vessels and nerve cells. One of these chemicals,
histamine, binds to the surfaces of these other cells,
through special proteins called histamine receptors.
Interaction of histamine with receptors on blood
vessels causes neighboring cells to become leaky,
leading to the fluid collection, swelling, and increased
redness characteristic of a runny nose and red, irritated eyes. Histamine also stimulates pain receptors,
causing the itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat
common in allergic rhinitis.
The particular allergens to which a person is sensitive can be determined through allergy testing.
Allergy tests may be performed on the skin or using
blood serum in a test tube. During skin tests, potential
allergens are placed on the skin and the reaction
is observed. In radio-allergosorbent allergy testing
(RAST), a patient’s blood serum is combined

Allergen—A substance that provokes an allergic
response.
Anaphylaxis—Increased sensitivity caused by
previous exposure to an allergen that can result
in blood vessel dilation (swelling) and smooth
muscle contraction. Anaphylaxis can result in
sharp blood pressure drops and difficulty
breathing.
Antibody—A specific protein produced by the
immune system in response to a specific foreign
protein or particle called an antigen.
Antigen—A foreign protein to which the body
reacts by making antibodies.
Histamine—A chemical released by mast cells that
activates pain receptors and causes cells to become

with allergen in a test tube to determine if serum antibodies react with the allergen. Provocation testing
involves direct exposure to a likely allergen, either
through inhalation or ingestion. Positive reactions
from any of these tests may be used to narrow the
candidates for the actual allergen causing the allergy.
Identification of the allergenic substance may
allow the patient to avoid the substance and reduce
allergic reactions. In addition, allergy testing may
be done in those with asthma that is difficult to
manage, eczema, or skin rashes to determine if an
allergy is causing the condition or making it worse.
Allergy tests may also be done before allergen desensitization to ensure the safety of more extensive exposure.
Skin testing is the most common type of allergy test.
There are two forms: percutaneous and intradermal. In
percutaneous or prick testing, allergen solutions are
placed on the skin, and the skin is then pricked with a
needle, allowing the allergen to enter the skin and
become exposed to mast cells. Scratch testing, in which
the skin is scratched instead of punctured, is used less
often. Intradermal testing involves directly injecting
allergen solutions into the skin. In both tests, a reddened,
swollen spot develops at the injection site for each
129

KEY TERMS

Allergy tests

substance to which the person is sensitive. Skin reactivity
is seen for allergens regardless of whether they usually
affect the skin. In other words, airborne and food allergens cause skin reactions equally well.
The range of allergens used for testing is chosen to
reflect possible sources in the environment and may
include the following:


pollen from a variety of trees, common grasses, and
weeds



mold and fungus spores



house dust



house mites



animal skin cells (dander) and saliva



food extracts



antibiotics



insect venoms

Radio-allergosorbent testing (RAST) is a laboratory test performed when a person may be too sensitive to risk skin testing or when medications or skin
conditions prevent it.
Provocation testing is done to positively identify
suspected allergens after preliminary skin testing.
A purified preparation of the allergen is inhaled or
ingested in increasing concentrations to determine if
it will provoke a response. In 2004, scientists introduced an optical method to continuously measure the
changes in nasal mucosa (lining) changes with an
infrared light to help improve the accuracy of provocation testing. Food testing is much more tedious than
inhalation testing, since full passage through the digestive system may take a day or more.

Precautions
While allergy tests are quite safe for most people,
the possibility of a condition known as anaphylaxis
exists. Anaphylaxis is a potentially dangerous condition that can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp
drop in blood pressure. People with a known history
of anaphylaxis should inform the testing clinician.
Skin tests should never include a substance known to
cause anaphylaxis in the person being tested.
Provocation tests may cause an allergic reaction.
Therefore, treatment medications should be available
following the tests, to be administered, if needed.

Description
In prick testing, a drop of each allergen to be tested
is placed on the skin, usually on the forearm or the back.
130

A typical battery of tests may involve two dozen allergen
drops, including a drop of saline solution that should
not provoke a reaction (negative control) and a drop of
histamine that should provoke a reaction (positive control). A small needle is inserted through the drop, and
used to prick the skin below. A new needle is used for
each prick. The sites are examined over the next 20 minutes for evidence of swelling and redness, indicating a
positive reaction. In some instances, a tracing of the set
of reactions may be made by placing paper over
the tested area. Similarly, in intradermal testing, separate injections are made for each allergen tested.
Observations are made over the next 20 minutes.
In RAST testing, a blood sample is taken for use in
the laboratory, where the antibody- containing serum
is separated from the blood cells. The serum is then
exposed to allergens bound to a solid medium. If a
person has antibodies to a particular allergen, those
antibodies will bind to the solid medium and remain
behind after a rinse. Location of allergen-antibody combinations is done by adding antibody-reactive antibodies, so called anti-antibodies, that are chemically linked
with a radioactive dye. By locating radioactive spots on
the solid medium, the reactive allergens are discovered.
Provocation testing may be performed to identify
airborne or food allergens. Inhalation testing is performed only after a patient’s lung capacity and
response to the medium used to dilute the allergen
has been determined. Once this has been determined,
the patient inhales increasingly concentrated samples
of a particular allergen, followed each time by measurement of the exhalation capacity. Only one allergen
is tested per day. Testing for food allergies is usually
done by removing the suspect food from the diet for
two weeks, followed by eating a single portion of the
suspect food and follow-up monitoring.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Skin testing is preceded by a brief examination of
the skin. The patient should refrain from using antiallergy drugs for at least 48 hours before testing. Prior
to inhalation testing, patients with asthma who can
tolerate it may be asked to stop any asthma medications.
Testing for food allergies requires the person to avoid
all suspect food for at least two weeks before testing.

Gastrointestinal symptoms within 24 hours
following the ingestion of a suspected food allergen
indicates a positive response.

Aftercare
Skin testing does not usually require any aftercare.
A generalized redness and swelling may occur in the test
area, but it will usually resolve within a day or two.
Inhalation tests may cause delayed asthma
attacks, even if the antigen administered in the test
initially produced no response. Severe initial reactions
may justify close professional observation for at least
12 hours after testing.

Risks
Intradermal testing may inadvertently result in
the injection of the allergen into the circulation, with
an increased risk of adverse reactions. Inhalation tests
may provoke an asthma attack. Exposure to new or
unsuspected allergens in any test carries the risk of
anaphylaxis. Because patients are monitored following allergy testing, an anaphylactic reaction is usually
recognized and treated promptly. Occasionally, a
delayed anaphylactic response can occur that will
require immediate care. Proper patient education
regarding how to recognize anaphylaxis is vital.

Normal results
Lack of redness or swelling on a skin test indicates
no allergic response. In an inhalation test, the exhalation capacity should remain unchanged. In a food
challenge, no symptoms should occur.

Abnormal results
Presence of redness or swelling, especially over
5 mm (1/4 inch) in diameter, indicates an allergic
response. This does not mean the substance actually
causes the patient’s symptoms, however, since he or
she may have no regular exposure to the allergen. In
fact, the actual allergen may not have been included in
the test array.
Following allergen inhalation, reduction in exhalation capacity of more than 20%, and for at least 10-20
minutes, indicates a positive reaction to the allergen.

I Alopecia
Definition
Alopecia simply means hair loss (baldness).

Description
Hair loss occurs for a great many reasons, from
conditions that make people literally pull it out to
complete hair loss caused by the toxicity of cancer
chemotherapy. Some causes are considered natural,
while others signal serious health problems. Some
conditions are confined to the scalp. Others reflect
disease throughout the body. Being plainly visible,
the skin and its components can provide early signs
of disease elsewhere in the body.
Oftentimes, conditions affecting the skin of the
scalp will result in hair loss. The first clue to the specific
cause is the pattern of hair loss, whether it be complete
baldness (alopecia totalis), patchy bald spots, thinning,
or hair loss confined to certain areas. Also a factor is
the condition of the hair and the scalp beneath it.
Sometimes only the hair is affected; sometimes the
skin is visibly diseased as well.

Causes and symptoms


Male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) is considered normal in adult males. It is easily recognized
by the distribution of hair loss over the top and front
of the head and by the healthy condition of the scalp.



Alopecia areata is a hair loss condition of unknown
cause that can be patchy or extend to complete
baldness.



Fungal infections of the scalp usually cause patchy
hair loss. The fungus, similar to the ones that cause
athlete’s foot and ringworm, often glows under ultraviolet light.



Trichotillomania is the name of a mental disorder
that causes a person to pull out his or her own hair.



Complete hair loss is a common result of cancer
chemotherapy, due to the toxicity of the drugs used.



Systemic diseases often affect hair growth either
selectively or by altering the skin of the scalp. One
example is thyroid disorders. Hyperthyroidism
(too much thyroid hormone) causes hair to become
thin and fine. Hypothyroidism (too little thyroid
hormone) thickens both hair and skin.



Several autoimmune diseases (when protective cells
begin to attack self cells within the body) affect the
skin, notably lupus erythemematosus.



In 2004, a report a the annual meeting of the
American Academy of Dermatology said that alopecia was becoming nearly epidemic among black

132

Diagnosis
Dermatologists are skilled in diagnosis by sight
alone. For more obscure diseases, they may have to
resort to a skin biopsy, removing a tiny bit of skin using
a local anesthetic so that it can be examined under a
microscope. Systemic diseases will require a complete
evaluation by a physician, including specific tests to
identify and characterize the problem.

Treatment
Successful treatment of underlying causes is most
likely to restore hair growth, be it the completion of
chemotherapy, effective cure of a scalp fungus, or control of a systemic disease. Two relatively new drugs–
minoxidil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Proscar)–promote
hair growth in a significant minority of patients,
especially those with male pattern baldness and alopecia areata. While both drugs have so far proved to be
quite safe when used for this purpose, minoxidil is a
liquid that is applied to the scalp and finasteride is
the first and only approved treatment in a pill form.
Minoxidil was approved for over-the-counter
sales in 1996. When used continuously for long periods of time, minoxidil produces satisfactory results in
about one-fourth of patients with androgenic alopecia
and as many as half the patients with alopecia areata.
There is also an over-the-counter extra-strength
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Over the past few decades a multitude of hair
replacement methods have been performed by physicians and non-physicians. They range from simply
weaving someone else’s hair in with the remains of
one’s own to surgically transplanting thousands of
hair follicles one at a time.
Hair transplantation is completed by taking tiny
plugs of skin, each containing one to several hairs,
from the back side of the scalp. The bald sections are
then implanted with the plugs. Research completed in
2000 looked at the new technique of hair grafting, and
found that micrografts (one or two hairs transplanted
per follicle) resulted in fewer complications and the
best results.
Another surgical procedure used to treat androgenic alopecia is scalp reduction. By stretching skin,
the hairless scalp can be removed and the area of bald
skin decreased by closing the space with hair-covered
scalp. Hair-bearing skin can also be folded over an
area of bald skin with a technique called a flap.
Stem cell research is generating new hope for
baldness. Scientists know that a part of the hair follicle
called the bulge contains stem cells that can give rise to
new hair and help heal skin wounds. Early research
with mice in 2004 showed promise for identifying the
genes that cause baldness and to identify drugs that
can reverse the process.

Prognosis
The prognosis varies with the cause. It is generally
much easier to lose hair than to regrow it. Even when it
returns, it is often thin and less attractive than the
original.

I Alpha-fetoprotein test
Definition
The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test is a blood test
that is performed during pregnancy. This screening
test measures the level of AFP in the mother’s blood
and indicates the probability that the fetus has one
of several serious birth defects. The level of AFP can
also be determined by analyzing a sample of amniotic
fluid. This screening test cannot diagnose a specific
condition; it only indicates increased risk for several
birth defects. Outside pregnancy, the AFP test is used
to detect liver disease, certain cancerous tumors, and
to monitor the progress of cancer treatment.

Purpose
Alpha-fetoprotein is a substance produced by the
liver of a fetus. The exact function of this protein is
unknown. After birth, the infant’s liver stops producing
AFP, and an adult liver contains only trace amounts.
During pregnancy, the fetus excretes AFP in urine and
some of the protein crosses the fetal membranes to
enter the mother’s blood. The level of AFP can then
be determined by analyzing a sample of the mother’s
blood. By analyzing the amount of AFP found in a
blood or amniotic fluid sample, doctors can determine
the probability that the fetus is at risk for certain birth
defects. It is very important that the doctor know
precisely how old the fetus is when the test is performed
since the AFP level changes over the length of the
pregnancy. Alone, AFP screening cannot diagnose a
birth defect. The test is used as an indicator of risk and
then an appropriate line of testing (such as amniocentesis or ultrasound) follows, based on the results.
Abnormally high AFP may indicate that the
fetus has an increased risk of a neural tube defect,
the most common and severe type of disorder
associated with increased AFP. These types of defects
include spinal column defects (spina bifida) and
anencephaly (a severe and usually fatal brain
abnormality). If the tube that becomes the brain

to note that new hair stops growing soon after the use
of minoxidil is discontinued.

reappear in liver disease, or tumors of the liver, ovaries, or testicles. The AFP test is used to screen people
at high risk for these conditions. After a cancerous
tumor is removed, an AFP test can monitor the
progress of treatment. Continued high AFP levels
suggest the cancer is growing.

Precautions
and spinal cord does not close correctly during fetal
development, AFP may leak through this abnormal
opening and enter the amniotic fluid. This leakage
creates abnormally high levels of AFP in amniotic
fluid and in maternal blood. If the screening test
indicates abnormally high AFP, ultrasound is used
to diagnose the problem.
Other fetal conditions that can raise AFP levels
above normal include:


cysts at the end of the spine



blockage in the esophagus or intestines



liver disease causing liver cells to die



defects in the abdominal wall



kidney or urinary tract defects or disease



brittle bone disease

Levels may also be high if there is too little fluid in
the amniotic sac around the fetus, more than one
developing fetus, or a pregnancy that is farther along
than estimated.
For unknown reasons, abnormally low AFP may
indicate that the fetus has an increased risk of Down
syndrome. Down syndrome is a condition that includes
mental retardation and a distinctive physical appearance
linked to an abnormality of chromosome 21 (called
trisomy 21). If the screening test indicates an abnormally
low AFP, amniocentesis is used to diagnose the problem.
Abnormally low levels of AFP can also occur when
the fetus has died or when the mother is overweight.
AFP is often part of a ‘‘triple check’’ blood test
that analyzes three substances as risk indicators of
possible birth defects: AFP, estriol, and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). When all three substances
are measured in the mother’s blood, the accuracy of
the test results increases.
In 2004, a new study showed that the risk of an
infant’s death from sudden infant death syndrome
(SIDS) increased if levels of AFP were higher during
the second trimester of the mother’s pregnancy.
Although AFP in human blood gradually disappears after birth, it never disappears entirely. It may
134

It is very important that the doctor know precisely
how old the fetus is when the test is performed since
the AFP level considered normal changes over the
length of the pregnancy. Errors in determining the
age of the fetus lead to errors when interpreting
the test results. Since an AFP test is only a screening
tool, more specific tests must follow to make an accurate diagnosis. An abnormal test result does not necessarily mean that the fetus has a birth defect. The test
has a high rate of abnormal results (either high or low)
to prevent missing a fetus that has a serious condition.

Description
The AFP test is usually performed at week 16 of
pregnancy. Blood is drawn from the patient’s
(mother’s) vein, usually on the inside of the elbow.
AFP can also be measured in the sample of amniotic
fluid taken at the time of amniocentesis. Test results
are usually available after about one week.

Preparation
There is no specific physical preparation for the
AFP test.

Aftercare
There is no specific aftercare involved with this
screening test.

Risks
The risks associated with drawing blood are minimal, but may include bleeding from the puncture
site, feeling faint or lightheaded after the blood is
drawn, or blood accumulating under the puncture
site (hematoma).

Normal results
Alpha-fetoprotein is measured in nanograms per
milliliter (ng/mL) and is expressed as a probability.
The probability (1:100, for example) translates into
the chance that the fetus has a defect (a one in 100
chance, for example).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Abnormal results
The doctor will inform the woman of her specific
increased risk as compared to the ‘‘normal’’ risk of a
standard case. If the risk of Down syndrome is greater
than the standard risk for women who are 35 years old
or older (one in 270), amniocentesis is recommended.
Again, the test has a high rate of showing an abnormal
AFP level in order to prevent missing a fetus that has
Down’s syndrome. This screening test only predicts
risk; appropriate diagnostic testing will follow after an
abnormal screening result.
In tumor or liver disease testing, an AFP level
greater than 50 ng/mL is considered abnormal.

Purpose
These drugs, called alpha blockers for short, are
used for two main purposes: to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and to treat benign prostatic
hyperplasia (BPH), a condition that affects men and
is characterized by an enlarged prostate gland.
High blood pressure
High blood pressure puts a strain on the heart and
the arteries. Over time, hypertension can damage the
blood vessels to the point of causing stroke, heart failure or kidney failure. People with high blood pressure
may also be at higher risk for heart attacks.
Controlling high blood pressure makes these problems
less likely. Alpha blockers help lower blood pressure
by causing vasodilation, meaning an increase in the
diameter of the blood vessels, which allows blood to
flow more easily.

This condition particularly affects older men.
Over time, the prostate, a donut-shaped gland
below the bladder, enlarges. When this happens, it
may interfere with the passage of urine from the
bladder out of the body. Men who are diagnosed
with BPH may have to urinate more often. Or they
may feel that they can not completely empty their
bladders. Alpha blockers inhibit the contraction of
prostatic smooth muscle and thus relax muscles in
the prostate and the bladder, allowing urine to flow
more freely.

Commonly prescribed alpha blockers for hypertension and BPH include doxazosin (Cardura, prazosin (Minipress) and terazosin (Hytrin). Prazosin is also
used in the treatment of heart failure. All are available
only with a physician’s prescription and are sold in
tablet form.

I Alpha -adrenergic blockers
1

Definition
Alpha1-adrenergic blockers are drugs that work
by blocking the alpha1-receptors of vascular smooth
muscle, thus preventing the uptake of catecholamines
by the smooth muscle cells. This causes vasodilation
and allows blood to flow more easily.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The recommended dose depends on the patient
and the type of alpha blocker and may change over
the course of treatment. The prescribing physician will
gradually increase the dosage, if necessary. Some
patients may need as much as 15-20 mg per day of
terazosin, 16 mg per day of doxazosin, or as much as
40 mg per day of prazosin, but most people benefit
from lower doses. As the dosage increases, so does the
possibility of unwanted side effects.

When testing for cancer or liver diseases, AFP
results are reported as nanograms per milliliter. An
AFP level less than or equal to 50 ng/mL is considered
normal.

Alpha1-adrenergic blockers

KEY TERMS
Adrenergic—Refers to neurons (nerve cells) that use
catecholamines as neurotransmitters at a synapse.
Adrenergic receptor—There are three families of
adrenergic receptors, alpha1, alpha2 and beta, and
each family contains three distinct subtypes. Each of
the nine subtypes are coded by separate genes, and
display specific drug specificities and regulatory
properties.
Alpha blockers—Medications that bind alpha adrenergic receptors and decrease the workload of the
heart and lower blood pressure. They are commonly
used to treat hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, and hyperplasia.
Arteries—Blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood
away from the heart to the cells, tissues, and organs
of the body.
Catecholamines—Family of neurotransmitters containing dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine,
produced and secreted by cells of the adrenal
medulla in the brain. Catecholamines have excitatory effects on smooth muscle cells of the vessels that
supply blood to the skin and mucous membranes
and have inhibitory effects on smooth muscle cells
located in the wall of the gut, the bronchial tree of the
lungs, and the vessels that supply blood to skeletal

Alpha blockers should be taken exactly as directed, even if the medication does not seem to be working at first. It should not be stopped even if symptoms
improve because it needs to be taken regularly to be
effective. Patients should avoid missing any doses, and
should not take larger or more frequent doses to make
up for missed doses.

Precautions
Alpha blockers may lower blood pressure to a
greater extent than desired. This can cause dizziness,
lightheadedness, heart palpitations, and fainting.
Activities such as driving, using machines, or doing
anything else that might be dangerous for 24 hours
after taking the first dose should be avoided. Patients
should be reminded to be especially careful not to
fall when getting up in the middle of the night. The
same precautions are recommended if the dosage
is increased or if the drug has been stopped and
then started again. Anyone whose safety on the job
could be affected by taking alpha blockers should

inform his or her physician, so that the physician
can take this factor into account when increasing
dosage.
Some people may feel drowsy or less alert when
using these drugs. They should accordingly avoid
driving or performing activities that require full
attention.
People diagnosed with kidney disease or liver disease may also be more sensitive to alpha blockers.
They should inform their physicians about these conditions if alpha blockers are prescribed. Older people
may also be more sensitive and may be more likely to
have unwanted side effects, such as fainting, dizziness,
and lightheadedness.
It should be noted that alpha blockers do not cure
high blood pressure. They simply help to keep the
condition under control. Similarly, these drugs will
not shrink an enlarged prostate gland. Although they
will help relieve the symptoms of prostate enlargement, the prostate may continue to grow, and it eventually may be necessary to have prostate surgery.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Anyone who has had unusual reactions to alpha
blockers in the past should let his or her physician
know before taking the drugs again. The physician
should also be told about any allergies to foods,
dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
The effects of taking alpha blockers during pregnancy are not fully understood. Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant should inform
their physicians. Breastfeeding mothers who need to
take alpha blockers should also talk to their physicians. These drugs can pass into breast milk and may
affect nursing babies. It may be necessary to stop
breastfeeding while being treated with alpha blockers.

Side effects
The most common side effects are dizziness, drowsiness, tiredness, headache, nervousness, irritability,
stuffy or runny nose, nausea, pain in the arms and legs,
and weakness. These problems usually go away as the
body adjusts to the drug and do not require medical
treatment. If they do not subside or if they interfere with
normal activities, the physician should be informed.
If any of the following side effects occur, the prescribing physician should be notified as soon as possible:


fainting



shortness of breath or difficulty breathing



fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat



swollen feet, ankles, wrists

Other side effects may occur. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after taking alpha blockers should
contact his or her physician.

Interactions
Doxazosin (Cardura) is not known to interact
with any other drugs. Terazosin (Hytrin) may interact
with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as
ibuprofen (Motrin), and with other blood pressure
drugs, such as enalapril (Vasotec), and verapamil
(Calan,Verelan). Prazosin (Minipress) may interact
with beta adrenergic blocking agents such as propranolol (Inderal) and others, and with verapamil (Calan,
Isoptin.) When drugs interact, the effects of one or
both of the drugs may change or the risk of side effects
may be greater.

I Alport syndrome
Definition
A hereditary disease of the kidneys that primarily
affects men, causing blood in the urine, hearing loss
and eye problems. Eventually, kidney dialysis or transplant may be necessary.

Description
Alport syndrome affects about one in 5,000
Americans, striking men more often and severely
than women. There are several varieties of the syndrome, some occurring in childhood and others not
causing symptoms until men reach their 20s or 30s. All
varieties of the syndrome are characterized by kidney
disease that usually progresses to chronic kidney failure and by uremia (the presence of excessive amounts
of urea and other waste products in the blood).

Causes and symptoms
Alport syndrome in most cases is caused by a
defect in one or more genes located on the X chromosome. It is usually inherited from the mother, who is a
normal carrier. However, in up to 20% of cases there is
no family history of the disorder. In these cases, there
appears to be a spontaneous genetic mutation causing
Alport syndrome.
Blood in the urine (hematuria) is a hallmark of
Alport syndrome. Other symptoms that may appear in
varying combinations include:


protein in the urine (proteinuria)



sensorineural hearing loss



eye problems [involuntary, rhythmic eye movements
(nystagmus), cataracts, or cornea problems]



skin problems



platelet disorders



abnormal white blood cells



smooth muscle tumors

Not all patients with Alport syndrome have hearing problems. In general, those with normal hearing
have less severe cases of Alport syndrome.

Diagnosis
Alport syndrome is diagnosed with a medical evaluation and family history, together with a kidney
biopsy that can detect changes in the kidney typical of
137

Alpha blockers may lower blood counts. Patients
may need to have their blood checked regularly while
taking this medicine.

KEY TERMS
Albumin—A protein that is important in maintaining blood volume. Low albumin levels is one sign
of Alport syndrome.
Dialysis—A technique of removing waste material
from the blood. It is used with patients whose kidneys have stopped functioning and can no longer
cleanse the blood on their own.
Diuretic—A drug that increases the amount of
urine a person produces.
Hematuria—Blood in the urine, Hematuria is a
hallmark of Alport syndrome.
Pulmonary edema—Excess fluid in the air spaces of
the lungs.
Uremia—The presence of excessive amounts of
urea and other waste products in the blood.

the condition. Urinalysis may reveal blood or protein in
the urine. Blood tests can reveal a low platelet level.
In addition, tests for the Alport gene are now
available. Although testing is fairly expensive, it is
covered by many types of health insurance. DNA
tests can diagnose affected children even before birth,
and genetic linkage tests tracing all family members at
risk for Alport syndrome are also available.

The treatment for chronic kidney failure is dialysis
or a kidney transplant.

Prognosis
Women with this condition can lead a normal life,
although they may have slight hearing loss. An
affected woman may notice blood in her urine only
when under stress or pregnant.
Men generally have a much more serious problem
with the disease. Most will experience kidney disease
in their 20s or 30s, which may eventually require dialysis or transplantation, and many develop significant
hearing loss. Men with Alport syndrome often die of
complications by middle age.

Prevention
Alport syndrome is a genetic disease and prevention efforts are aimed at providing affected individuals
and their families with information concerning the
genetic mechanisms responsible for the disease. Since
it is possible to determine if a woman is a carrier, or if
an unborn child has the condition, genetic counseling
can provide helpful information and support for the
decisions that affected individuals and their families
may have to make.

ORGANIZATIONS

Treatment
There is no specific treatment that can ‘‘cure’’
Alport syndrome. Instead, care is aimed at easing the
problems related to kidney failure, such as the presence
of too many waste products in the blood (uremia).
To control kidney inflammation (nephritis),
patients should:


restrict fluids



control high blood pressure



manage pulmonary edema



control high blood levels of potassium

Rarely patients with Alport syndrome may develop
nephrotic syndrome, a group of symptoms including
too much protein in the urine, low albumin levels, and
swelling. To ease these symptoms, patients should:


drink less



eat a salt-free diet



use diuretics



have albumin transfusions

I Altitude sickness
Definition
Altitude sickness is a general term encompassing a
spectrum of disorders that occur at higher altitudes.
Since the severity of symptoms varies with altitude, it
is important to understand the range of the different
altitudes that may be involved. High altitude is defined
as height greater than 8,000 feet (2,438m); medium
altitude is defined as height between 5,000 and 8,000
feet (1,524-2,438m); and extreme altitude is defined as
height greater than 19,000 feet (5,791 m). The majority
of healthy individuals suffer from altitude sickness when
they reach very high altitudes. In addition, about 20%
of people ascending above 9,000 feet (2,743m) in one
day will develop altitude sickness. Children under six
years and women in the premenstrual part of their cycles
may be more vulnerable. Individuals with preexisting
medical conditions–even a minor respiratory infection–
may become sick at more moderate altitudes.

Description
There are three major clinical syndromes that fall
under the heading of altitude sickness: acute mountain
sickness (AMS), high-altitude pulmonary edema
(HAPE), and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE).
These syndromes are not separate, individual syndromes as much as they are a continuum of severity,
all resulting from a decrease in oxygen in the air. AMS
is the mildest, and the other two represent severe, lifethreatening forms of altitude sickness.
Altitude sickness occurs because the partial pressure of oxygen decreases with altitude. (Partial pressure is a term applied to gases that is similar to the way
the term concentration is applied to liquid solutions.)
For instance, at 18,000 feet (5,486 m) the partial pressure of oxygen drops to one-half its value at sea level
and, therefore, there is a substantially lower amount of
oxygen available for the individual to inhale. This is
known as hypoxia. Furthermore, since there is less
oxygen to inhale, less oxygen reaches the blood. This
is known as hypoxemia. These two conditions are the
major factors that form the basis for all the medical
problems associated with altitude sickness.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Hypoxia—A deficiency in the amount of oxygen
required for effective ventilation.
Pulmonary—Pertaining to the lungs.

As a person becomes hypoxemic, his natural
response is to breathe more rapidly (hyperventilate).
This is the body’s attempt to bring in more oxygen at
a rapid rate. This attempt at alleviating the effects of the
hypoxia at higher altitudes is known as acclimatization,
and it occurs during the first few days. Acclimatization
is a response that occurs in individuals who travel from
lower to higher altitudes. There are groups of people
who have lived at high altitudes (for example, in the
Himalayan and Andes mountains) for generations, and
they are simply accustomed to living at such altitudes,
perhaps through a genetic ability.

Causes and symptoms
Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a mild form of
altitude sickness that results from ascent to altitudes
higher greater than 8,000 feet (2,438m)–even 6,500 feet
(1,981 m) in some susceptible individuals. Although
hypoxia is associated with the development of AMS,
the exact mechanism by which this condition develops
has yet to be confirmed. It is important to realize that
some individuals acclimatize to higher altitudes more
efficiently than others. As a result, under similar conditions some will suffer from AMS while others will not.
At present, the susceptibility of otherwise healthy individuals to contracting AMS cannot be accurately predicted. Of those who do suffer from AMS, the condition
tends to be most severe on the second or third day after
reaching the high altitude, and it usually abates after
three to five days if they remain at the same
altitude. However, it can recur if the individuals travel
to an even higher altitude. Symptoms usually appear a
few hours to a few days following ascent, and they
include dizziness, headache, shortness of breath, nausea,
vomiting, loss of appetite, and insomnia.
High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a lifethreatening condition that afflicts a small percentage
of those who suffer from AMS. In this condition, fluid
leaks from within the pulmonary blood vessels into the
lung tissue. As this fluid begins to accumulate within
139

Altitude sickness

Alprazolam see Benzodiazepines

Alzheimer’s disease

the lung tissue (pulmonary edema), the individual
begins to become more and more short of breath.
HAPE is known to afflict all types of individuals,
regardless of their level of physical fitness.
Typically, the individual who suffers from HAPE
ascends quickly to a high altitude and almost immediately develops shortness of breath, a rapid heart
rate, a cough productive of a large amount of sometimes bloody sputum, and a rapid rate of breathing.
If no medical assistance is provided by this point,
the patient goes into a coma and dies within a few
hours.
High-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), the rarest
and most severe form of altitude sickness, involves
cerebral edema, and its mechanism of development is
also poorly understood. The symptoms often begin
with those of AMS, but neurologic symptoms such
as an altered level of consciousness, speech abnormalities, severe headache, loss of coordination, hallucinations, and even seizures. If no intervention is
implemented, death is the result.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis for altitude sickness may be made
from the observation of the individual’s symptoms
during travel to higher altitudes.

Prevention
When individuals ascend from sea level, it is recommended that they spend at least one night at
an intermediate altitude prior to ascending to higher
elevations. In general, climbers should take at least two
days to go from sea level to 8,000 feet (2,438m). After
reaching that point, healthy climbers should generally
allow one day for each additional 2,000 feet (610m), and
one day of rest should be taken every two or three days.
Should mild symptoms begin to surface, further ascent
should be avoided. If the symptoms are severe, the individual should return to a lower altitude. Some reports
indicate that acetazolamide (a diuretic) may be taken
before ascent as a preventative measure for AMS.
Paying attention to diet can also help prevent altitude sickness. Water loss is a problem at higher altitudes, so climbers should drink ample water (enough to
produce copious amounts of relatively light-colored or
clear urine). Alcohol and large amounts of salt should
be avoided. Eating frequent small, high-carbohydrate
snacks (for example, fruits, jams and starchy foods)
can help, especially in the first few days of climbing.

Foundations. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, 1997.

Treatment
Mild AMS requires no treatment other than an
aspirin or ibuprofen for headache, and avoidance of
further ascent. Narcotics should be avoided because
they may blunt the respiratory response, making
it even more difficult for the person to breathe deeply
and rapidly enough to compensate for the lower levels
of oxygen in the environment. Oxygen may also be
used to alleviate symptoms of mild AMS.
As for HAPE and HACE, the most important
course of action is descent to a lower altitude as soon
as possible. Even a 1,000-2,000-foot (305-610 m) descent can dramatically improve one’s symptoms. If
descent is not possible, oxygen therapy should be
started. In addition, dexamethasone (a steroid) has
been suggested in order to reduce cerebral edema.

I Alzheimer’s disease
Definition
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form
of dementia, a neurologic disease characterized by loss
of mental ability severe enough to interfere with normal
activities of daily living, lasting at least six months, and
not present from birth. AD usually occurs in old age,
and is marked by a decline in cognitive functions such as
remembering, reasoning, and planning.

Prognosis
The prognosis for mild AMS is good, if appropriate measures are taken. As for HAPE and HACE,
the prognosis depends upon the rapidity and distance
of descent and the availability of medical intervention.
Descent often leads to improvement of symptoms,
however, recovery times vary among individuals.
140

Description
A person with AD usually has a gradual decline in
mental functions, often beginning with slight memory
loss, followed by losses in the ability to maintain
employment, to plan and execute familiar tasks, and to
reason and exercise judgment. Communication ability,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The cost of caring for a person with AD is considerable. The annual cost of caring for one AD
patient in 1998 was estimated as about $18,400 for a
patient with mild AD, $30,100 for a patient with moderate AD, and $36,100 for a patient with severe AD.
The annual direct and indirect costs of caring for AD
patients in the United States was estimated to be as
much as $100 billion. Slightly more than half of people
with AD are cared for at home, while the remainder
are cared for in a variety of health care institutions.

Causes and symptoms
Causes
The cause or causes of Alzheimer’s disease are largely unknown, though some forms have genetic links.
Some strong leads have been found through recent
research, however, and these have given some theoretical support to several new experimental treatments.

mood, and personality also may be affected. Most
people who have AD die within eight years of their
diagnosis, although the interval may be as short as one
year or as long as 20 years. AD is the fourth leading
cause of death in adults after heart disease, cancer, and
stroke.
Between two and four million Americans have
AD; that number is expected to grow to as many as
14 million by the middle of the 21st century as the
population ages. While a small number of people in
their 40s and 50s develop the disease (called earlyonset AD), AD predominantly affects the elderly.
AD affects about 3% of all people between ages 65
and 74, about 19% of those between 75 and 84, and
about 47% of those over 85. Slightly more women
than men are affected with AD, but this may be
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

At first AD destroys neurons (nerve cells) in parts
of the brain that control memory, including the
hippocampus, which is a structure deep in the deep
that controls short-term memory. As these neurons
in the hippocampus stop functioning, the person’s
short-term memory fails, and the ability to perform
familiar tasks decreases. Later AD affects the cerebral
cortex, particularly the areas responsible for language
and reasoning. Many language skills are lost and the
ability to make judgments is affected. Personality
changes occur, which may include emotional outbursts, wandering, and agitation. The severity of
these changes increases with disease progression.
Eventually many other areas of the brain become
involved, the brain regions affected atrophy (shrink
and lose function), and the person with AD becomes
bedridden, incontinent, helpless, and non-responsive.
Autopsy of a person with AD shows that the
regions of the brain affected by the disease become
clogged with two abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. Neurofibrillary
tangles are twisted masses of protein fibers inside nerve
cells, or neurons. In AD, tau proteins, which normally
help bind and stabilize parts of neurons, are changed
chemically, become twisted and tangled, and no longer
can stabilize the neurons. Amyloid plaques consist of
insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid, (a protein fragment
from a larger protein called amyloid precursor protein
(APP), mixed with parts of neurons and non-nerve
cells. Plaques are found in the spaces between the
nerve cells of the brain. While it is not clear exactly

how these structures cause problems, many researchers
believe that their formation is responsible for the mental changes of AD, presumably by interfering with the
normal communication between neurons in the brain
and later leading to the death of neurons. By 2000,
three drugs for the treatment of AD symptoms were
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). They act by increasing the level of chemical
signaling molecules in the brain, known as neurotransmitters, to make up for this decreased communication
ability. All act by inhibiting the activity of acetylcholinesterase, which is an enzyme that breaks down
acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter released
by neurons that is necessary for cognitive function.
These drugs modestly increase cognition and improve
one’s ability to perform normal activities of daily living.
142

Exactly what triggers the formation of plaques
and tangles and the development of AD is unknown.
AD likely results from many interrelated factors,
including genetic, environmental, and others not yet
identified. Two types of AD exist: familial AD (FAD),
which is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disease,
and sporadic AD, with no obvious inheritance pattern. AD also is described in terms of age at onset, with
early onset AD occurring in people younger than 65,
and late-onset occurring in those 65 and older. Early
onset AD comprises about 5-10 % of AD cases and
affects people aged 30 to 60. Some cases of early onset
AD are inherited and are common in some families.
Early-onset AD often progresses faster than the more
common late-onset type.
All cases of FAD, which is relatively uncommon,
that have been identified to date are the early onset
type. As many as 50% of FAD cases are known to
be caused by three genes located on three different
chromosomes. Some families have mutations in the
APP gene located on chromosome 21, which causes
the production of abnormal APP protein. Others
have mutations in a gene called presenilin 1 located
on chromosome 14, which causes the production of
abnormal presenilin 1 protein, and others have mutations in a similar gene called presenilin 2 located
on chromosome 1, which causes production of abnormal presenilin 2. Presenilin 1 may be one of the
enzymes that clips APP into beta-amyloid; it also
may be important in the synaptic connections between
brain cells.
There is no evidence that the mutated genes that
cause early onset FAD also cause late onset AD, but
genetics appears to play a role in this more common
form of AD. Discovered by researchers at Duke
University in the early 1990s, potentially the most
important genetic link to AD was on chromosome 19.
A gene on this chromosome, called APOE (apolipoprotein E), codes for a protein involved in transporting
lipids into neurons. APOE occurs in at least three forms
(alleles), called APOE e2, APOE e3, and APOE e4.
Each person inherits one APOE from each parent, and
therefore can either have one copy of two different
forms, or two copies of one. The relatively rare APOE
e2 appears to protect some people from AD, as it seems
to be associated with a lower risk of AD and a later age
of onset if AD develops. APOE e3 is the most common
version found in the general population, and only
appears to have a neutral role in AD. However, APOE
e4 appears to increase the risk of developing late onset
AD with the inheritance of one or two copies of APOE
e4. Compared to those without APOE e4, people with
one copy are about three times as likely to develop lateGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Other non-genetic factors have been studied in
relation to the causes of AD. Inflammation of the
brain may play a role in development of AD, and use
of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
were once thought to reduce the risk of developing
AD. Other agents once thought to reduce chances of
dementia are now thought to increase its risk. In 2002,
hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which combines
estrogen and progestogen, was found to double the
risk of developing dementia in postmenopausal
women. Highly reactive molecular fragments called
free radicals damage cells of all kinds, especially
brain cells, which have smaller supplies of protective
antioxidants thought to protect against free radical
damage. Vitamin E is one such antioxidant, and its
use in AD may be of possible theoretical benefit.
While the ultimate cause or causes of Alzheimer’s
disease still are unknown, there are several risk factors
that increase a person’s likelihood of developing the
disease. The most significant one is, of course, age;
older people develop AD at much higher rates than
younger ones. There is some evidence that strokes and
AD may be linked, with small strokes that go undetected clinically contributing to the injury of neurons.
A 2003 Dutch study reported that symptomless, unnoticed strokes could double the risk of AD and other
dementias. Blood cholesterol levels also may be
important. Scientists have shown that high blood
cholesterol levels in special breeds of genetically
engineered (transgenic) mice may increase the rate of
plaque deposition. There are also parallels between
AD and other progressive neurodegenerative disorders that cause dementia, including prion diseases,
Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Numerous epidemiological studies of populations
also are being conducted to learn more about whether
and to what extent early life events, socioeconomic
factors, and ethnicity have an impact on the development of AD. For example, a 2003 report showed that
the more formal education a person has, the better his
or her memory is, despite presence of AD. Other studies have related education level or participation in
leisure activities such as playing cards or doing crossword puzzles to delayed onset of AD.
Many environmental factors have been suspected
of contributing to AD, but epidemiological population studies have not borne out these links. Among
these have been pollutants in drinking water, aluminum from commercial products, and metal dental fillings. To date, none of these factors has been shown to
cause AD or increase its likelihood. Further research
may yet turn up links to other environmental factors.
Symptoms
The symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease begin gradually, usually with memory lapses. Occasional memory lapses are of course common to everyone, and do
not by themselves signify any change in cognitive
function. The person with AD may begin with only
the routine sort of memory lapse — forgetting where
the car keys are — but progress to more profound or
disturbing losses, such as forgetting that he or she can
even drive a car. Becoming lost or disoriented on a walk
around the neighborhood becomes more likely as the
disease progresses. A person with AD may forget the
names of family members, or forget what was said at
the beginning of a sentence by the time he hears the end.
As AD progresses, other symptoms appear,
including inability to perform routine tasks, loss of
judgment, and personality or behavior changes.
Some people with AD have trouble sleeping and may
suffer from confusion or agitation in the evening
(‘‘sunsetting’’ or Sundowner’s Syndrome). In some
cases, people with AD repeat the same ideas, movements, words, or thoughts. In the final stages people
may have severe problems with eating, communicating, and controlling their bladder and bowel functions.
The Alzheimer’s Association has developed a list
of 10 warning signs of AD. A person with several of
these symptoms should see a physician for a thorough
evaluation:

memory loss that affects job skills



difficulty performing familiar tasks



problems with language



disorientation of time and place

Alzheimer’s disease

onset AD, and those with two copies are almost four
times as likely to do so. Having APOE e4 also can lower
the age of onset by as much as 17 years. However,
APOE e4 only increases the risk of developing AD
and does not cause it, as not everyone with APOE e4
develops AD, and people without it can still have the
disease. Why APOE e4 increases the chances of developing AD is not known with certainty. However, one
theory is that APOE e4 facilitates beta-amyloid buildup
in plaques, thus contributing to the lowering of the age
of onset of AD; other theories involve interactions with
cholesterol levels and effects on nerve cell death independent of its effects on plaque buildup. In 2000, four
new AD-related regions in the human genome were
identified, where one out of several hundred genes in
each of these regions may be a risk factor gene for AD.
These genes, which are not yet identified, appear to
make a contribution to the risk of developing lateonset AD that is at least as important as APOE e4.

Other types of dementia, including some that are
reversible, can cause similar symptoms. It is important for the person with these symptoms to be evaluated by a professional who can weigh the possibility
that his or her symptoms may have another cause.
Approximately 20% of those originally suspected of
having AD turn out to have some other disorder;
about half of these cases are treatable.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease is complex, and
may require office visits to several different specialists
over several months before a diagnosis can be made.
While a confident provisional diagnosis may be made
in most cases after thorough testing, AD cannot be
diagnosed definitively until autopsy examination of
the brain for plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
The diagnosis of AD begins with a thorough
physical exam and complete medical history. Except
in the disease’s earliest stages, accurate history from
family members or caregivers is essential. Since there
are both prescription and over-the-counter drugs
that can cause the same mental changes as AD, a
careful review of the patient’s drug, medicine, and
alcohol use is important. AD-like symptoms also
can be provoked by other medical conditions, including tumors, infection, and dementia caused by mild
strokes (multi-infarct dementia). These possibilities
must be ruled out as well through appropriate blood
and urine tests, brain magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
scans, tests of the brain’s electrical activity (electroencephalographs or EEGs), or other tests. Several
types of oral and written tests are used to aid in the
AD diagnosis and to follow its progression, including
tests of mental status, functional abilities, memory,
and concentration. Still, the neurologic exam is
normal in most patients in early stages.
One of the most important parts of the diagnostic
process is to evaluate the patient for depression and
delirium, since each of these can be present with AD, or
may be mistaken for it. (Delirium involves a decreased
consciousness or awareness of one’s environment.)
144

Depression and memory loss both are common
in the elderly, and the combination of the often can
be mistaken for AD. On the other hand, depression
can be a risk factor for AD. A 2003 study showed that
a history of depressive symptoms can be associated
with nearly twice the risk of eventually developing
AD. Depression can be treated with drugs, although
some antidepressants can worsen dementia if it is
present, further complicating both diagnosis and
treatment.
An early and accurate diagnosis of AD is important in developing strategies for managing symptoms
and for helping patients and their families planning
for the future and pursuing care options while the
patient can still take part in the decision-making
process.
A genetic test for the APOE e4 gene is available,
but is not used for diagnosis, since possessing even two
copies does not ensure that a person will develop AD.
In addition, access to genetic information could affect
the insurability of a patient if disclosed, and also affect
employment status and legal rights.

Treatment
Alzheimer’s disease is presently incurable. Recent
reports show that prompt intervention can slow decline
from AD. The use of medications mentioned below as
early as possible in the course of AD can help people
with the disease maintain independent function as long
as possible. The remaining treatment for a person with
AD is good nursing care, providing both physical and
emotional support for a person who is gradually able to
do less and less for himself, and whose behavior is
becoming more and more erratic. Modifications of the
home to increase safety and security often are necessary. The caregiver also needs support to prevent anger,
despair, and burnout from becoming overwhelming.
Becoming familiar with the issues likely to lie ahead,
and considering the appropriate financial and legal
issues early on, can help both the patient and family
cope with the difficult process of the disease. Regular
medical care by a practitioner with a non-defeatist
attitude toward AD is important so that illnesses such
as urinary or respiratory infections can be diagnosed
and treated properly, rather than being incorrectly
attributed to the inevitable decline seen in AD.
People with AD often are depressed or anxious,
and may suffer from sleeplessness, poor nutrition, and
general poor health. Each of these conditions is treatable to some degree. It is important for the person
with AD to eat well and continue to exercise.
Professional advice from a nutritionist may be useful
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Drugs
As of 2003, four drugs—tacrine (Cognex), donepezil hydrochloride (Aricept), and rivastigmine
(Exelon)—have been approved by the FDA for its
treatment. Tacrine has been shown to be effective for
improving memory skills, but only in patients with
mild-to-moderate AD, and even then in less than half
of those who take it. Its beneficial effects are usually
mild and temporary, but it may delay the need for
nursing home admission. The most significant side
effect is an increase in a liver enzyme known as alanine
aminotransferase, or ALT. Patients taking tacrine
must have a weekly blood test to monitor their ALT
levels. Other frequent side effects include nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, indigestion, and
skin rash. The cost of tacrine was about $125 per
month in early 1998, with additional costs for the
weekly blood monitoring. Despite its high cost, tacrine
appears to be cost-effective for those who respond to
it, since it may decrease the number of months a
patient needs nursing care. Donepezil is the drug
most commonly used to treat mild to moderate symptoms of AD, although it only helps some patients for
periods of time ranging from months to about two
years. Donepezil has two advantages over tacrine: it
has fewer side effects, and it can be given once daily
rather than three times daily. Donepezil does not
appear to affect liver enzymes, and therefore does
not require weekly blood tests. The frequency of
abdominal side effects is also lower. The monthly
cost is approximately the same. Rivastigmine,
approved for use in April of 2000, has been shown to
improve the ability of patients to carry out daily activities, such as eating and dressing, decrease behavioral
symptoms such as delusions and agitation, and improve
cognitive functions such as thinking, memory, and
speaking. The cost is similar to those of the other
two drugs. However, none of these three drugs stops
or reverses the progression of AD. Galantamine
(Reminyl) works in the early and moderates stages
of AD. It has fewer side effects than other drugs,
with the exception of donepezil and must be taken
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

twice a day. Three other drugs were being tested for
AD treatment in mid-2003.
Estrogen, the female sex hormone, is widely prescribed for post-menopausal women to prevent osteoporosis. Studies once showed that estrogen was
beneficial to women with AD, but in 2003, a large
clinical trial called the Women’s Health Initiative
showed dementia among other negative effects of
combined estrogen therapy.
Preliminary studies once suggested a reduced risk
for developing AD in elderly people who regularly used
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
including aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, although
not acetaminophen. However, an important study
published in 2003 showed that NSAIDs were not effective in preventing or slowing the progression of AD.
The study authors recommended that people stop
taking NSAIDs to slow dementia.
Antioxidants, which act to inhibit and protect
against oxidative damage caused by free radicals, have
been shown to inhibit toxic effects of beta-amyloid in
tissue culture. Therefore, research is being conducted
to see whether antioxidants may delay or prevent AD.
Another antioxidant, vitamin E, is also thought
to delay AD onset. Hoever, it is not yet clear whether
this is due to the specific action of vitamin E on brain
cells, or to an increase in the overall health of those
taking it.
Drugs such as antidepressants, anti-psychotics,
and sedatives are used to treat the behavioral symptoms (agitation, aggression, wandering, and sleep disorders) of AD. Research is being conducted to search
for better treatments, including non-drug approaches
for AD patients.
Nursing care and safety
The person with Alzheimer’s disease will gradually lose the ability to dress, groom, feed, bathe, or use
the toilet by himself; in the later stages of the disease,
he may be unable to move or speak. In addition, the
person’s behavior becomes increasingly erratic. A
tendency to wander may make it difficult to leave
him unattended for even a few minutes and make
even the home a potentially dangerous place. In
addition, some people with AD may exhibit inappropriate sexual behaviors.
The nursing care required for a person with AD is
well within the abilities of most people to learn. The
difficulty for many caregivers comes in the constant
but unpredictable nature of the demands put on them.
In addition, the personality changes undergone by a
145

Alzheimer’s disease

to provide healthy, easy-to-prepare meals. Finger
foods may be preferable to those requiring utensils to
be eaten. Regular exercise (supervised if necessary for
safety) promotes overall health. A calm, structured
environment with simple orientation aids (such as
calendars and clocks) may reduce anxiety and increase
safety. Other psychiatric symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, hallucinations (seeing or hearing things
that aren’t there), and delusions (false beliefs) may be
treated with drugs if necessary.

Alzheimer’s disease

person with AD can be heartbreaking for family members as a loved one deteriorates, seeming to become a
different person. Not all people with AD develop
negative behaviors. Some become quite gentle, and
spend increasing amounts of time in dreamlike states.
A loss of good grooming may be one of the early
symptoms of AD. Mismatched clothing, unkempt hair,
and decreased interest in personal hygiene become
more common. Caregivers, especially spouses, may
find these changes socially embarrassing and difficult
to cope with. The caregiver usually will need to spend
increasing amounts of time on grooming to compensate
for the loss of attention from the patient, although
some adjustment of expectations (while maintaining
cleanliness) is often needed as the disease progresses.
Proper nutrition is important for a person with
AD, and may require assisted feeding early on, to
make sure the person is taking in enough nutrients.
Later on, as movement and swallowing become difficult, a feeding tube may be placed into the stomach
through the abdominal wall. A feeding tube requires
more attention, but is generally easy to care for if the
patient is not resistant to its use.
For many caregivers, incontinence becomes the
most difficult problem to deal with at home, and is a
principal reason for pursuing nursing home care. In
the early stages, limiting fluid intake and increasing
the frequency of toileting can help. Careful attention
to hygiene is important to prevent skin irritation and
infection from soiled clothing.
Persons with dementia must deal with six basic
safety concerns: injury from falls, injury from ingesting dangerous substances, leaving the home and getting lost, injury to self or others from sharp objects,
fire or burns, and the inability to respond rapidly to
crisis situations. In all cases, a person diagnosed with
AD should no longer be allowed to drive, because of
the increased potential for accidents and the increased
likelihood of wandering very far from home while
disoriented. In the home, simple measures such as
grab bars in the bathroom, bed rails on the bed, and
easily negotiable passageways can greatly increase
safety. Electrical appliances should be unplugged and
put away when not in use, and matches, lighters, knives, or weapons should be stored safely out of reach.
The hot water heater temperature may be set lower
to prevent accidental scalding. A list of emergency
numbers, including the poison control center and the
hospital emergency room, should be posted by the
phone. As the disease progresses, caregivers need to
periodically reevaluate the physical safety of the home
and introduce new strategies for continued safety.
146

Care for the caregiver
Family members or others caring for a person with
AD have an extremely difficult and stressful job, which
becomes harder as the disease progresses. Dementia
caregivers spend significantly more time on caregiving
than do people providing care for those with other
types of illnesses. This type of caregiving also has a
greater impact in terms of employment complications,
caregiver strain, mental and physical health problems,
time for leisure and other family members, and family
conflict than do other types of caregiving. It is common
for AD caregivers to develop feelings of anger, resentment, guilt, and hopelessness, in addition to the sorrow
they feel for their loved one and for themselves.
Depression is an extremely common consequence of
being a full-time caregiver for a person with AD.
Support groups are an important way to deal with the
stress of caregiving. Becoming a member of an AD
caregivers’ support group can be one of the most
important things a family member does, not only for
him or herself, but for the person with AD as well. The
location and contact numbers for AD caregiver support groups are available from the Alzheimer’s
Association; they also may be available through a
local social service agency, the patient’s physician, or
pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the drugs
used to treat AD. Medical treatment for depression
may be an important adjunct to group support.
Outside help, nursing homes, and governmental
assistance
Most families eventually need outside help to
relieve some of the burden of around-the-clock care
for a person with AD. Personal care assistants, either
volunteer or paid, may be available through local social
service agencies. Adult daycare facilities are becoming
increasingly common. Meal delivery, shopping assistance, or respite care may be available as well.
Providing the total care required by a person
with late-stage AD can become an overwhelming
burden for a family, even with outside help. At this
stage, many families consider nursing home care.
This decision often is one of the most difficult for
the family, since it is often seen as an abandonment of
the loved one and a failure of the family. Careful
counseling with a sympathetic physician, clergy, or
other trusted adviser may ease the difficulties of this
transition. Selecting a nursing home may require a
difficult balancing of cost, services, location, and
availability. Keeping the entire family involved in
the decision may help prevent further stress from
developing later on.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Private long-term care insurance, special ‘‘reverse
mortgages,’’ viatical insurance, and other financial
devices are other ways of paying for care for those
with the appropriate financial situations. Further
information on these options may be available
through resources listed below.

Alternative treatment
Several substances are currently being tested
for their ability to slow the progress of Alzheimer’s
disease. These include acetylcarnitine, a supplement
that acts on the cellular energy structures known as
mitochondria. Ginkgo extract, derived from the leaves
of the Ginkgo biloba tree, appears to have antioxidant
as well as anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant properties. Ginkgo extract has been used for many years
in China and is widely prescribed in Europe for treatment of circulatory problems. A 1997 study of patients
with dementia seemed to show that ginkgo extract
could improve their symptoms, though the study was
criticized for certain flaws in its method. Large scale
follow-up studies are being conducted to determine
whether Ginkgo extract can prevent or delay the
development of AD. Ginkgo extract is available in
many health food or nutritional supplement stores.
Some alternative practitioners also advise people
with AD to take supplements of phosphatidylcholine,
vitamin B12, gotu kola, ginseng, St. Johnõs Wort,
rosemary, saiko-keishi-to-shakuyaku (A Japanese
herbal mixture), and folic acid.

Prognosis
While Alzheimer’s disease may not be the direct
cause of death, the generally poorer health of a person
with AD increases the risk of life-threatening infection, including pneumonia. In addition, other diseases
common in old age–cancer, stroke, and heart disease–
may lead to more severe consequences in a person with
AD. On average, people with AD live eight years past
their diagnosis, with a range from one to 20 years.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Prevention
Currently, there is no sure way to prevent
Alzheimer’s disease. treatments discussed above may
eventually be proven to reduce the risk of developing
the disease. Avoiding risks such as hormone replacement therapy may help prevent development of AD.
Research on the prevention of AD is focusing on
blocking the production of amyloid in the brain as well
as breaking down beta-amyloid once it is released
from cells but before it has a chance to aggregate
into insoluble plaques. There also are promising
studies being conducted to develop an AD vaccine,
where immune responses may result in the elimination
of the formation of amyloid plaques.
The Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers
(ADCs) program promotes research, training and
education, technology transfer, and multicenter and
cooperative studies in AD, other dementias, and normal brain aging. Each ADC enrolls and performs
studies on AD patients and healthy older people.
Persons can participate in research protocols and
clinical drug trials at these centers. Data from the
ADCs as well as from other sources are coordinated
and made available for use by researchers at the
National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center, established in 1999.

Description
Lazy eye is a common non-medical term used to
describe amblyopia because the eye with poorer vision
doesn’t seem to be doing its job of seeing. Amblyopia
is the most common cause of impaired vision in children, affecting nearly three out of every 100 people or
2-4% of the population. Vision is a combination of the
clarity of the images of the eyes (visual acuity) and the
processing of those images by the brain. If the images
produced by the two eyes are substantially different,
the brain may not be able to fuse the images. Instead of
seeing two different images or double vision (diplopia), the brain suppresses the blurrier image. This
suppression can lead to amblyopia. During the first
few years of life, preferring one eye over the other may
lead to poor visual development in the blurrier eye.

Causes and symptoms
Some of the major causes of amblyopia are as
follows:


Strabismus. A misalignment of the eyes (strabismus)
is the most common cause of functional amblyopia.
The two eyes are looking in two different directions at
the same time. The brain is sent two different images
and this causes confusion. Images from the misaligned
or ‘‘crossed’’ eye are turned off to avoid double vision.



Anisometropia. This is another type of functional
amblyopia. In this case, there is a difference of refractive states between the two eyes (in other words, a
difference of prescriptions between the two eyes).
For example, one eye may be more nearsighted than
the other eye, or one eye may be farsighted and the
other eye nearsighted. Because the brain cannot fuse
the two dissimilar images, the brain will suppress the
blurrier image, causing the eye to become amblyopic.



Cataract. Clouding of the lens of the eye will cause
the image to be blurrier than the other eye. The brain
‘‘prefers’’ the clearer image. The eye with the cataract
may become amblyopic.



Ptosis. This is the drooping of the upper eyelid. If
light cannot enter the eye because of the drooping lid,
the eye is essentially not being used. This can lead to
amblyopia.



Nutrition. A type of organic amblyopia in which
nutritional deficiencies or chemical toxicity may
result in amblyopia. Alcohol, tobacco, or a deficiency
in the B vitamins may result in toxic amblyopia.



Heredity. Amblyopia can run in families.

I Amblyopia
Definition
Amblyopia is an uncorrectable decrease in vision in
one or both eyes with no apparent structural abnormality seen to explain it. It is a diagnosis of exclusion,
meaning that when a decrease in vision is detected,
other causes must be ruled out. Once no other cause is
found, amblyopia is the diagnosis. Generally, a difference of two lines or more (on an eye-chart test of visual
acuity) between the two eyes or a best corrected vision
of 20/30 or worse would be defined as amblyopia. For
example, if someone has 20/20 vision with the right eye
and only 20/40 with the left, and the left eye cannot
achieve better vision with corrective lenses, the left eye
is said to be amblyopic.

Barring the presence of strabismus or ptosis,
children may or may not show signs of amblyopia.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Anisometropia—An eye condition in which there
is an inequality of vision between the two eyes.
There may be unequal amounts of nearsightedness,
farsightedness, or astigmatism, so that one eye will
be in focus while the other will not.
Cataract—Cloudiness of the eye’s natural lens.
Occulsion therapy—A type of treatment for
amblyopia in which the good eye is patched for a
period of time. This forces the weaker eye to be
used.

Children may hold their heads at an angle while trying
to favor the eye with normal vision. They may have
trouble seeing or reaching for things when approached
from the side of the amblyopic eye. Parents should
see if one side of approach is preferred by the child
or infant. If an infant’s good eye is covered, the child
may cry.

Diagnosis
Because children with outwardly normal eyes may
have amblyopia, it is important to have regular vision
screenings performed for all children. While there is
some controversy regarding the age children should
have their first vision examination, their eyes can, in
actuality, be examined at any age, even at one day of life.
Some recommend that children have their vision
checked by their pediatrician, family physician,
ophthalmologist, or optometrist at or before six
months of age. Others recommend testing by at least
the child’s fourth birthday. There may be a ‘‘critical
period’’ in the development of vision, and amblyopia
may not be treatable after age eight or nine. The earlier
amblyopia is found, the better the possible outcome.
Most physicians test vision as part of a child’s medical
examination. If there is any sign of an eye problem,
they may refer a child to an eye specialist.
There are objective methods, such as retinoscopy,
to measure the refractive status of the eyes. This can
help determine anisometropia. In retinoscopy, a handheld instrument is used to shine a light in the child’s (or
infant’s) eyes. Using hand-held lenses, a rough prescription can be obtained. Visual acuity can be determined using a variety of methods. Many different eye
charts are available (e.g., tumbling E, pictures, or
letters). In amblyopia, single letters are easier to

Strabismus—A condition in which the eyes are
misaligned and point in different directions. One
eye may look straight ahead, while the other turns
inward, outward, upward, or downward. This is
also called crossed-eyes.
Visual acuity—Acuity is the acuteness or sharpness
of vision.

recognize than when a whole line is shown. This is
called the ‘‘crowding effect’’ and helps in diagnosing
amblyopia. Neutral density filters may also be held
over the eye to aid in the diagnosis. Sometimes visual
fields to determine defects in the area of vision will be
performed. Color vision testing may also be performed. Again, it must be emphasized that amblyopia
is a diagnosis of exclusion. Visual or life-threatening
problems can also cause a decrease in vision. An examination of the eyes and visual system is very important
when there is an unexplained decrease in vision.

Treatment
The primary treatment for amblyopia is occlusion
therapy. It is important to alternate patching the good
eye (forcing the amblyopic eye to work) and the
amblyopic eye. If the good eye is constantly patched,
it too may become amblyopic because of disuse. The
treatment plan should be discussed with the doctor to
fully understand how long the patch will be on. When
patched, eye exercises may be prescribed to force the
amblyopic eye to focus and work. This is called vision
therapy or vision training (eye exercises). Even after
vision has been restored in the weak eye, part-time
patching may be required over a period of years to
maintain the improvement.
While patching is necessary to get the amblyopic
eye to work, it is just as important to correct the reason
for the amblyopia. Glasses may also be worn if there

are errors in refraction. Surgery or vision training may
be necessary in the case of strabismus. Better nutrition
is indicated in some toxic amblyopias. Occasionally,
amblyopia is treated by blurring the vision in the good
eye with eye drops or lenses to force the child to use the
amblyopic eye.

Prognosis
The younger the person, the better the chance for
improvement with occlusion and vision therapy.
However, treatment may be successful in older children–even adults. Success in the treatment of amblyopia also depends upon how severe the amblyopia is,
the specific type of amblyopia, and patient compliance. It is important to diagnose and treat amblyopia
early because significant vision loss can occur if left
untreated. The best outcomes result from early diagnosis and treatment.

Prevention
To protect their child’s vision, parents must be
aware of amblyopia as a potential problem. This
awareness may encourage parents to take young children for vision exams early on in life–certainly before
school age. Proper nutrition is important in the avoidance of toxic amblyopia.

I Amebiasis
Definition
Amebiasis is an infectious disease caused by a
parasitic one-celled microorganism (protozoan) called
Entamoeba histolytica. Persons with amebiasis may
experience a wide range of symptoms, including diarrhea, fever, and cramps. The disease may also affect
the intestines, liver, or other parts of the body.
150

Description
Amebiasis, also known as amebic dysentery, is one
of the most common parasitic diseases occurring in
humans, with an estimated 500 million new cases each
year. It occurs most frequently in tropical and subtropical areas where living conditions are crowded, with
inadequate sanitation. Although most cases of amebiasis occur in persons who carry the disease but do
not exhibit any symptoms (asymptomatic), as many as
100,000 people die of amebiasis each year. In the
United States, between 1 and 5% of the general population will develop amebiasis in any given year, while
male homosexuals, migrant workers, institutionalized
people, and recent immigrants develop amebiasis at a
higher rate.
Human beings are the only known host of the
amebiasis organism, and all groups of people, regardless
of age or sex, can become affected. Amebiasis is primarily spread in food and water that has been contaminated
by human feces but is also spread by person-to-person
contact. The number of cases is typically limited, but
regional outbreaks can occur in areas where human
feces are used as fertilizer for crops, or in cities with
water supplies contaminated with human feces.

Causes and symptoms
Recently, it has been discovered that persons
with symptom-causing amebiasis are infected with
Entamoeba histolytica, and those individuals who
exhibit no symptoms are actually infected with an
almost identical-looking ameba called Entamoeba
dispar. During their life cycles, the amebas exist in
two very different forms: the infective cyst or
capsuled form, which cannot move but can survive
outside the human body because of its protective
covering, and the disease-producing form, the
trophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannot survive once excreted in the feces and, therefore,
cannot infect others. The disease is most commonly
transmitted when a person eats food or drinks water
containing E. histolytica cysts from human feces. In
the digestive tract the cysts are transported to the
intestine where the walls of the cysts are broken
open by digestive secretions, releasing the mobile
trophozoites. Once released within the intestine, the
trophozoites multiply by feeding on intestinal bacteria or by invading the lining of the large intestine.
Within the lining of the large intestine, the
trophozoites secrete a substance that destroys intestinal tissue and creates a distinctive bottle-shaped
sore (ulcer). The trophozoites may remain inside the
intestine, in the intestinal wall, or may break through

the wall of the colon in response to amebic

the intestinal wall and be carried by the blood to the
liver, lungs, brain, or other organs. Trophozoites that
remain in the intestines eventually form new cysts
that are carried through the digestive tract and
excreted in the feces. Under favorable temperature
and humidity conditions, the cysts can survive in
soil or water for weeks to months, ready to begin
the cycle again.
Although 90% of cases of amebiasis in the United
States are mild, pregnant women, children under two
years of age, the elderly, malnourished individuals,
and people whose immune systems may be compressed,
such as cancer or AIDS patients and those individuals
taking prescription medications that suppress the
immune system, are at a greater risk for developing a
severe infection.
The signs and symptoms of amebiasis vary
according to the location and severity of the infection
and are classified as follows:
Intestinal amebiasis
Intestinal amebiasis can be subdivided into several
categories:
ASYMPTOMATIC INFECTION. Most persons with
amebiasis have no noticeable symptoms. Even though
these individuals may not feel ill, they are still capable
of infecting others by person-to-person contact or by
contaminating food or water with cysts that others
may ingest, for example, by preparing food with
unwashed hands.
CHRONIC NON-DYSENTERIC INFECTION. Individuals may experience symptoms over a long period
of time during a chronic amebiasis infection and

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Asymptomatic—Persons who carry a disease and
are usually capable of transmitting the disease but
who do not exhibit symptoms of the disease are
said to be asymptomatic.
Dysentery—Intestinal infection marked by diarrhea containing blood and mucus.
Fulminating colitis—A potentially fatal complication of amebic dysentery marked by sudden and
severe inflammation of the intestinal lining, severe
bleeding or hemorrhaging, and massive shedding
of dead tissue.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)—Disease in
which the lining of the intestine becomes inflamed.
Lumen—The inner cavity or canal of a tube-shaped
organ, such as the bowel.
Protozoan—A single-celled, usually microscopic
organism that is eukaryotic and, therefore, different
from bacteria (prokaryotic).

experience recurrent episodes of diarrhea that last
from one to four weeks and recur over a period of
years. These patients may also suffer from abdominal
cramps, fatigue, and weight loss.
AMEBIC DYSENTERY. In severe cases of intestinal
amebiasis, the organism invades the lining of the
intestine, producing sores (ulcers), bloody diarrhea,
severe abdominal cramps, vomiting, chills, and
fevers as high as 104-1058F (40-40.68C). In addition,
a case of acute amebic dysentery may cause complications, including inflammation of the appendix
(appendicitis), a tear in the intestinal wall (perforation), or a sudden, severe inflammation of the colon
(fulminating colitis).
AMEBOMA. An ameboma is a mass of tissue in the
bowel that is formed by the amebiasis organism. It can
result from either chronic intestinal infection or acute
amebic dysentery. Amebomas may produce symptoms that mimic cancer or other intestinal diseases.

151

Amebiasis

KEY TERMS

Amebiasis

PERIANAL ULCERS. Intestinal amebiasis may produce skin infections in the area around the patient’s
anus (perianal). These ulcerated areas have a
‘‘punched-out’’ appearance and are painful to the touch.

Extraintestinal amebiasis
Extraintestinal amebiasis accounts for approximately 10% of all reported amebiasis cases and includes
all forms of the disease that affect other organs.
The most common form of extraintestinal amebiasis is amebic abscess of the liver. In the United States,
amebic liver abscesses occur most frequently in young
Hispanic adults. An amebic liver abscess can result
from direct infection of the liver by E. histolytica or as
a complication of intestinal amebiasis. Patients with an
amebic abscess of the liver complain of pain in the chest
or abdomen, fever, nausea, and tenderness on the right
side directly above the liver.
Other forms of extraintestinal amebiasis, though
rare, include infections of the lungs, chest cavity,
brain, or genitals. These are extremely serious and
have a relatively high mortality rate.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of amebiasis is complicated, partly
because the disease can affect several areas of the
body and can range from exhibiting few, if any, symptoms to being severe, or even life-threatening. In most
cases, a physician will consider a diagnosis of amebiasis when a patient has a combination of symptoms, in
particular, diarrhea and a possible history of recent
exposure to amebiasis through travel, contact with
infected persons, or anal intercourse.
It is vital to distinguish between amebiasis and
another disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
that produces similar symptoms because, if diagnosed
incorrectly, drugs that are given to treat IBD can
encourage the growth and spread of the amebiasis
organism. Because of the serious consequences of
misdiagnosis, potential cases of IBD must be confirmed with multiple stool samples and blood tests,
and a procedure involving a visual inspection of the
intestinal wall using a thin lighted, tubular instrument
(sigmoidoscopy) to rule out amebiasis.
A diagnosis of amebiasis may be confirmed by one
or more tests, depending on the location of the disease.
Stool examination
This test involves microscopically examining a
stool sample for the presence of cysts and/or trophozoites of E. histolytica and not one of the many other
152

intestinal amebas that are often found but that do not
cause disease. A series of three stool tests is approximately 90% accurate in confirming a diagnosis of
amebic dysentery. Unfortunately, however, the stool
test is not useful in diagnosing amebomas or extraintestinal infections.
Sigmoidoscopy
Sigmoidoscopy is a useful diagnostic procedure in
which a thin, flexible, lighted instrument, called a
sigmoidoscope, is used to visually examine the lower
part of the large intestine for amebic ulcers and take
tissue or fluid samples from the intestinal lining.
Blood tests
Although tests designed to detect a specific
protein produced in response to amebiasis infection
(antibody) are capable of detecting only about 10%
of cases of mild amebiasis, these tests are extremely
useful in confirming 95% of dysentery diagnoses
and 98% of liver abscess diagnoses. Blood serum will
usually test positive for antibody within a week of
symptom onset. Blood testing, however, cannot
always distinguish between a current or past infection
since the antibodies may be detectable in the blood
for as long as 10 years following initial infection.
Imaging studies
A number of sophisticated imaging techniques,
such as computed tomography scans (CT), magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound, can be
used to determine whether a liver abscess is present.
Once located, a physician may then use a fine needle
to withdraw a sample of tissue to determine whether
the abscess is indeed caused by an amebic infection.

Treatment
Asymptomatic or mild cases of amebiasis may
require no treatment. However, because of the
potential for disease spread, amebiasis is generally
treated with a medication to kill the disease-causing
amebas. More severe cases of amebic dysentery are
additionally treated by replacing lost fluid and
blood. Patients with an amebic liver abscess will
also require hospitalization and bed rest. For those
cases of extraintestinal amebiasis, treatment can be
complicated because different drugs may be required
to eliminate the parasite, based on the location of
the infection within the body. Drugs used to treat
amebiasis, called amebicides, are divided into two
categories:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

These drugs get their name because they act on
organisms within the inner cavity (lumen) of the
bowel. They include diloxanide furoate, iodoquinol,
metronidazole, and paromomycin.
Tissue amebicides
Tissue amebicides are used to treat infections in
the liver and other body tissues and include emetine,
dehydroemetine, metronidazole, and chloroquine.
Because these drugs have potentially serious side
effects, patients given emetine or dehydroemetine
require bed rest and heart monitoring. Chloroquine
has been found to be the most useful drug for treating
amebic liver abscess. Patients taking metronidazole
must avoid alcohol because the drug-alcohol combination causes nausea, vomiting, and headache.
Most patients are given a combination of luminal
and tissue amebicides over a treatment period of seven
to ten days. Follow-up care includes periodic stool
examinations beginning two to four weeks after the
end of medication treatment to check the effectiveness
of drug therapy.

Prognosis
The prognosis depends on the location of the
infection and the patient’s general health prior to
infection. The prognosis is generally good, although
the mortality rate is higher for patients with ameboma,
perforation of the bowel, and liver infection. Patients
who develop fulminant colitis have the most serious
prognosis, with over 50% mortality.

Prevention
There are no immunization procedures or medications that can be taken prior to potential exposure to
prevent amebiasis. Moreover, people who have had
the disease can become reinfected. Prevention requires
effective personal and community hygiene.
Specific safeguards include the following:


Purification of drinking water. Water can be purified
by filtering, boiling, or treatment with iodine.



Proper food handling. Measures include protecting
food from contamination by flies, cooking food
properly, washing one’s hands after using the bathroom and before cooking or eating, and avoiding
foods that cannot be cooked or peeled when traveling in countries with high rates of amebiasis.



Careful disposal of human feces.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



Monitoring the contacts of amebiasis patients. The
stools of family members and sexual partners of
infected persons should be tested for the presence of
cysts or trophozoites.

I Amenorrhea
Definition
The absence of menstrual periods is called amenorrhea. Primary amenorrhea is the failure to start
having a period by the age of 16. Secondary amenorrhea is more common and refers to either the temporary or permanent ending of periods in a woman who
has menstruated normally in the past. Many women
miss a period occasionally. Amenorrhea occurs if a
woman misses three or more periods in a row.

Description
The absence of menstrual periods is a symptom,
not a disease. While the average age that menstruation
begins is 12, the range varies. The incidence of primary
amenorrhea in the United States is just 2.5%.
Some female athletes who participate in rowing,
long distance running, and cycling, may notice a few
missed periods. Women athletes at a particular risk for
developing amenorrhea include ballerinas and gymnasts, who typically exercise strenuously and eat poorly.

Causes and symptoms
Amenorrhea can have many causes. Primary amenorrhea can be the result of hormonal imbalances,
psychiatric disorders, eating disorders, malnutrition,
excessive thinness or fatness, rapid weight loss, body
fat content too low, and excessive physical conditioning. Intense physical training prior to puberty can delay
menarche (the onset of menstruation). Every year of
training can delay menarche for up to five months.

KEY TERMS
Hymen—Membrane that stretches across the opening of the vagina.
Hypothyroidism—Underactive thyroid gland.
Hysterectomy—Surgical removal of the uterus.
Turner’s syndrome—A condition in which one
female sex chromosome is missing.

Some medications such as anti-depressants, tranquilizers, steroids, and heroin can induce amenorrhea.
Primary amenorrhea
However, the main cause is a delay in the beginning of puberty either from natural reasons (such as
heredity or poor nutrition) or because of a problem in
the endocrine system, such as a pituitary tumor or
hypothyroidism. An obstructed flow tract or inflammation in the uterus may be the presenting indications
of an underlying metabolic, endocrine, congenital or
gynecological disorder.
Typical causes of primary amenorrhea include:


excessive physical activity



drastic weight loss (such as occurs in anorexia or
bulimia)



extreme obesity



drugs (antidepressants or tranquilizers)



chronic illness



turner’s syndrome. (A chromosomal problem in place
at birth, relevant only in cases of primary amenorrhea)



the absence of a vagina or a uterus



imperforate hymen (lack of an opening to allow the
menstrual blood through)
Secondary amenorrhea

Some of the causes of primary amenorrhea can
also cause secondary amenorrhea – strenuous physical
activity, excessive weight loss, use of antidepressants
or tranquilizers, in particular. In adolescents, pregnancy and stress are two major causes. Missed periods
are usually caused in adolescents by stress and changes
in environment. Adolescents are especially prone to
irregular periods with fevers, weight loss, changes in
environment, or increased physical or athletic activity.
However, any cessation of periods for four months
should be evaluated.
154

The most common cause of seconardy amenorrhea is pregnancy. Also, a woman’s periods may halt
temporarily after she stops taking birth control pills.
This temporary halt usually lasts only for a month or
two, though in some cases it can last for a year or
more. Secondary amenorrhea may also be related to
hormonal problems related to stress, depression, anorexia nervosa or drugs, or it may be caused by any
condition affecting the ovaries, such as a tumor. The
cessation of menstruation also occurs permanently
after menopause or a hysterectomy.

Diagnosis
It may be difficult to find the cause of amenorrhea, but the exam should start with a pregnancy test;
pregnancy needs to be ruled out whenever a woman’s
period is two to three weeks overdue. Androgen
excess, estrogen deficiency, or other problems with
the endocrine system need to be checked. Prolactin in
the blood and the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
should also be checked.
The diagnosis usually includes a patient history
and a physical exam (including a pelvic exam). If a
woman has missed three or more periods in a row, a
physician may recommend blood tests to measure
hormone levels, a scan of the skull to rule out the
possibility of a pituitary tumor, and ultrasound scans
of the abdomen and pelvis to rule out a tumor of the
adrenal gland or ovary.

Treatment
Treatment of amenorrhea depends on the cause.
Primary amenorrhea often requires no treatment, but
it’s alwaysimportant to discover the causeof the problem
in any case. Not all conditions can be treated, but any
underlying condition that is treatable should be treated.
If a hormonal imbalance is the problem, progesterone for one to two weeks every month or two may
correct the problem. With polycystic ovary syndrome,
birth control pills are often prescribed. A pituitary
tumor is treated with bromocriptine, a drug that reduces
certain hormone (prolactin) secretions. Weight loss may
bring on a period in an obese woman. Easing up on
excessive exercise and eating a proper diet may bring
on periods in teen athletes. In very rare cases, surgery
may be needed for women with ovarian or uterine cysts.

Prognosis
Prolonged amenorrhea can lead to infertility and
other medical problems such as osteoporosis (thinning
of the bones). If the halt in the normal period is caused
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The prognosis for polycystic ovary disease
depends on the severity of the symptoms and the
treatment plan. Spironolactone, a drug that blocks
the production of male hormones, can help in reducing
body hair. If a woman wishes to become pregnant,
treatment with clomiphene may be required or, on
rare occasions, surgery on the ovaries.

Prevention
Primary amenorrhea caused by a congenital condition cannot be prevented. In general, however, women
should maintain a healthy diet, with plenty of exercise,
rest, and not too much stress, avoiding smoking and
substance abuse. Female athletes should be sure to eat a
balanced diet and rest and exercise normally. However,
many cases of amenorrhea cannot be prevented.

screening
Definition
Amino acid disorder screening checks for inherited
disorders in amino acid metabolism. Tests are most
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

commonly done on newborns. Two tests are available,
one using a blood sample and the other a urine sample.

Purpose
Amino acid disorder screening is done in newborns, and sometimes children and adults, to detect
inborn errors in metabolism of amino acids. Twenty of
the 100 known amino acids are the main building
blocks for human proteins. Proteins regulate every
aspect of cellular function. Of these 20 amino acids,
ten are not made by the body and must be acquired
through diet. Congenital (present at birth) enzyme deficiencies that affect amino acid metabolism or congenital
abnormalities in the amino acid transport system of
the kidneys creates a condition called aminoaciduria.
Screening is especially important in newborns.
Some congenital amino acid metabolic defects cause
mental retardation that can prevented with prompt
treatment of the newborn. One of the best known
examples of this is phenylketonuria (PKU). This is an
genetic error in metabolism of phenylalanine, an
amino acid found in milk. Individuals with PKU do
not produce the enzyme necessary to break down
phenylalanine.
PKU occurs in about one out of 16,000 live births
in the United States, but is more prevalent in caucasians and less prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews and African
Americans. Newborns in the United States are routinely screened for PKU by a blood test.
There are two types of aminoacidurias. Primary
or overflow aminoaciduria results from deficiencies in
the enzymes necessary to metabolize amino acids.
Overflow aminoaciduria is best detected by a blood
plasma test.
Secondary or renal aminoaciduria occurs because
of a congenital defect in the amino acid transport
system in the tubules of the kidneys. This produces
increased amino acids in the urine. Blood and urine
test in combination are used to determine if the aminoaciduria is of the overflow or renal type. Urine tests
are also used to monitor specific amino acid disorders.
Newborns are screened for amino acid disorders.
Young children with acidosis (accumulation of acid
in the body), severe vomiting and diarrhea, or urine
with an abnormal color or odor, are also screened
with a urine test for specific amino acid levels.

Precautions
Both blood and urine tests are simple tests that
can be done in a doctor’s office or clinic. These tests
can be done on even the youngest patients.

by stress or illness, periods should begin again when
the stress passes or the illness is treated. Amenorrhea
that occurs with discontinuing birth control pills
usually go away within six to eight weeks, although it
may take up to a year.

Amino acid disorders screening

KEY TERMS
Amino acid—An organic compound composed of
both an amino group and an acidic carboxyl group;
amino acids are the basic building blocks of
proteins.
Aminoaciduria—The abnormal presence of amino
acids in the urine.
Chromatography—A family of laboratory techniques that separate mixtures of chemicals into their
individual components.
Enzyme—A biological catalyst that increases the
rate of a chemical reaction without being used up
in the reaction.
Metabolism—The sum of all the chemical and
energy reactions that take place in the human body.

Description
Two types of amino acid screening tests are used
together to diagnose amino acid disorders.
Blood plasma screening
In the blood test, a medical technician draws a
small amount of blood from a baby’s heel. The procedure is rapid and relatively painless. Total time for the
test is less than ten minutes. The blood is sent to a
laboratory where results will be available in about
two days.
Urine test
In the urine test, the patient is asked to urinate
into a collecting cup. For an infant, the urine is collected in a pediatric urine collector. The process is
painless. The length of time the test takes is determined
by how long it takes the patient to urinate. Results also
take about two days.
Both these tests use thin layer chromatography to
separate the amino acids present. Using this technique, the amino acids form a characteristic patterns on
a glass plate coated with a thin layer of silica gel. This
pattern is then compared to the normal pattern to
determine if there are abnormalities.

Preparation
Before the blood test, the patient must not eat or
drink for four hours. Failure to fast will alter the
results of the test.
156

The patient should eat and drink normally before
the urine test. Some drugs may affect the results of the
urine test. The technician handling the urine sample
should be informed of any medications the patient is
taking. Mothers of breastfeeding infants should report
any medications they are taking, since these can pass
from mother to child in breast milk.

Aftercare
The blood screening is normally done first.
Depending on the results, it is followed by the urine
test. It takes both tests to distinguish between overflow and renal aminoaciduria. Also, if the results are
abnormal, a 24-hour urine test is performed along
with other tests to determine the levels of specific
amino acids. In the event of abnormal results, there
are many other tests that will be performed to determine
the specific amino acid involved in the abnormality.

Risks
There are no particular risks associated with
either of these tests. Occasionally minor bruising may
occur at the site where the blood was taken.

Normal results
The pattern of amino acid banding on the thin
layer chromatography plates will be normal.

Abnormal results
The blood plasma amino acid pattern is abnormal in
overflow aminoaciduria and is normal in renal aminoaciduria. The pattern is abnormal in the urine test,
suggesting additional tests need to be done to determine
which amino acids are involved. In addition to PKU, a
variety of other amino acid metabolism disorders can
be detected by these tests, including tyrosinosis, histidinemia, maple syrup urine disease, hypervalinemia,
hyperprolinemia, and homocystinuria.

Definition
Aminoglycosides are a group of antibiotics that
are used to treat certain bacterial infections. This
group of antibiotics includes at least eight drugs:
amikacin, gentamicin, kanamycin, neomycin, netilmicin, paromomycin, streptomycin, and tobramycin.
All of these drugs have the same basic chemical
structure.

Purpose
Aminoglycosides are primarily used to combat
infections due to aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria.
These bacteria can be identified by their reaction to
Gram’s stain. In Gram’s staining, a film of material
containing the possible bacteria is placed on a glass
slide and dried. The slide is stained with crystal violet
for one minute, cleaned off with water and then placed
into a solution of Gram’s iodine solution for one
minute. The iodine solution is rinsed off and the slide
is immersed in 95% ethyl alcohol. The slide is then
stained again with reddish carbolfuchsin or safranine
for 30 seconds, rinsed in water, dried and examined.
Gram-positive bacteria retain the violet purple stain.
Gram-negative bacteria accept the red stain. Bacteria
that can successfully be combated with aminoglycosides include Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and
Enterobacter species, among others. Aminoglycosides
are also effective against mycobacteria, the bacteria
responsible for tuberculosis.
The aminoglycosides can be used against certain
Gram-positive bacteria, but are not typically
employed because other antibiotics are more effective
and have fewer side effects. Aminoglycosides are ineffective against anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that cannot grow in the presence of oxygen), viruses, and
fungi. And only one aminoglycoside, paromomycin,
is used against parasitic infection.
Like all other antibiotics, aminoglycosides are not
effective against influenza, the common cold, or other
viral infections.

Precautions
Pre-existing medical conditions–such as kidney
disease, eighth cranial nerve disease, myasthenia
gravis, and Parkinson’s disease–should be discussed
prior to taking any aminoglycosides. Pregnant
women are usually advised against taking aminoglycosides, because their infants may suffer damage to

their hearing, kidneys, or sense of balance. However,
those factors need to be considered alongside the
threat to the mother’s health and life in cases of
serious infection. Aminoglycosides do not pass into
breast milk to any great extent, so nursing mothers
may be prescribed aminoglycosides without injuring
their infants.

Description
Streptomycin, the first aminoglycoside, was
isolated from Streptomyces griseus in the mid-1940s.
This antibiotic was very effective against tuberculosis.
One of the main drawbacks to streptomycin is its
toxicity, especially to cells in the inner and middle ear
and the kidney. Furthermore, some strains of tuberculosis are resistant to treatment with streptomycin.
Therefore, medical researchers have put considerable
157

effort into identifying other antibiotics with streptomycin’s efficacy, but without its toxicity.
Aminoglycosides are absorbed very poorly from
the gastrointestinal tract; in fact, aminoglycosides
taken orally are excreted virtually unchanged and
undiminished in quantity. The route of drug administration depends on the type and location of the
infection being treated. The typical routes of administration are by intramuscular (injection into a muscle) or intravenous injection (injection into a vein),
irrigation, topical skin application, or inhalation.
If the infection being treated involves the central
nervous system, the drug can be injected into the
spinal canal.
The bactericidal ability of aminoglycosides has
not been fully explained. It is known that the drug
attaches to a bacterial cell wall and is drawn into the
cell via channels made up of the protein, porin. Once
inside the cell, the aminoglycoside attaches to the cell’s
ribosomes. Ribosomes are the intracellular structures
responsible for manufacturing proteins. This attachment either shuts down protein production or causes
the cell to produce abnormal, ineffective proteins. The
bacterial cell cannot survive with this impediment.
Antibiotic treatment using aminoglycosides may
pair the drug with a second type of antibiotic, usually
a beta-lactam or vancomycin, administered separately. Beta-lactams disrupt the integrity of the bacteria cell wall, making it more porous. The increased
porosity allows more of the aminoglycoside into the
bacteria cell.
Traditionally, aminoglycosides were administered
at even doses given throughout the day. It was thought
that a steady plasma concentration was necessary to
combat infection. However, this administration schedule is time and labor intensive. Furthermore, administering a single daily dose can be as effective, or more
effective, than several doses throughout the day.
Dosage depends on the patient’s age, weight, gender, and general health. Since the drug is cleared by the
kidneys, it is important to assess any underlying problems with kidney function. Kidney function is
assessed by measuring the blood levels of creatinine,
a protein normally found in the body. If these levels
are high, it is an indication that the kidneys may not be
functioning at an optimal rate and dosage will be
lowered accordingly.

Risks
Aminoglycosides have been shown to be toxic
to certain cells in the ears and in the kidneys.
158

Approximately 5-10% of the people who are
treated with aminoglycosides experience some side
effect, affecting their hearing, sense of balance, or
kidneys. However, in most cases the damage is minor
and reversible once medication is stopped.
If cells in the inner ear are damaged or destroyed,
an individual may experience a loss of balance and
feelings of dizziness. Damage to the middle ear may
result in hearing loss or tinnitus. Neomycin, kanamycin,
and amikacin are the most likely to cause problems with
hearing, and streptomycin and gentamicin carry the
greatest risk of causing vertigo and loss of balance.
Kidney damage, apparent with changes in urination
frequency or urine production, is most likely precipitated by neomycin, tobramycin, and gentamicin.
Young children and the elderly are at the greatest
risk of suffering side effects. Excessive dosage or poor
clearance of the drug from the body can be injurious at
any age.
Less common side effects include skin rashes and
itching. Very rarely, certain aminoglycosides may
cause difficulty in breathing, weakness, or drowsiness.
Gentamicin, when injected, may cause leg cramps,
skin rash, fever, or seizures.
If side effects linger or become worse after medication is stopped, it is advisable to seek medical advice.
Side effects that may be of concern include tinnitus or
loss of hearing, dizziness or loss of balance, changes in
urination frequency or urine production, increased
thirst, appetite loss, and nausea or vomiting.

Normal results
At the proper dosage and in the presence of gramnegative enteric (intestinal) bacteria, aminoglycosides
are very effective in treating an infection.

Abnormal results
In some cases, bacteria are resistant to antibiotics
that would normally kill them. This resistance
becomes apparent after repeated exposure to the antibiotic and arises from a mutation that alters the bacteria’s susceptibility to the drug. Various degrees of
resistance have been observed in bacteria that normally would be destroyed by aminoglycosides. In general, though, aminoglycoside effectiveness has held
up well over time.

I Amnesia
Definition
Amnesia refers to the loss of memory. Memory
loss may result from two-sided (bilateral) damage to
parts of the brain vital for memory storage, processing, or recall (the limbic system, including the hippocampus in the medial temporal lobe).

Hippocampus

Amygdala

Description
Amnesia can be a symptom of several neurodegenerative diseases; however, people whose primary
symptom is memory loss (amnesiacs), typically remain
lucid and retain their sense of self. They may even be
aware that they suffer from a memory disorder.
People who experience amnesia have been instrumental in helping brain researchers determine how
the brain processes memory. Until the early 1970s,
researchers viewed memory as a single entity.
Memory of new experiences, motor skills, past events,
and previous conditioning were grouped together in
one system that relied on a specific area of the brain.
If all memory were stored in the same way, it would
be reasonable to deduce that damage to the specific
brain area would cause complete memory loss. However, studies of amnesiacs counter that theory. Such
research demonstrates that the brain has multiple systems for processing, storing, and drawing on memory.

Causes and symptoms
Amnesia has several root causes. Most are traceable to brain injury related to physical trauma, disease,
infection, drug and alcohol abuse, or reduced blood
flow to the brain (vascular insufficiency). In WernickeKorsakoff syndrome, for example, damage to the
memory centers of the brain results from the use of
alcohol or malnutrition. Infections that damage brain
tissue, including encephalitis and herpes, can also
cause amnesia. If the amnesia is thought to be of
psychological origin, it is termed psychogenic.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Memory loss may result from bilateral damage to the limbic
system of the brain responsible for memory storage, processing, and recall. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group).

There are at least three general types of amnesia:


Anterograde. This form of amnesia follows brain
trauma and is characterized by the inability to
remember new information. Recent experiences and
short-term memory disappear, but victims can recall
events prior to the trauma with clarity.



Retrograde. In some ways, this form of amnesia is
the opposite of anterograde amnesia: the victim can
recall events that occurred after a trauma, but cannot
remember previously familiar information or the
events preceding the trauma.



Transient global amnesia. This type of amnesia has
no consistently identifiable cause, but researchers
have suggested that migraines or transient ischemic
attacks may be the trigger. (A transient ischemic
attack, sometimes called ‘‘a small stroke,’’ occurs
when a blockage in an artery temporarily blocks
off blood supply to part of the brain.) A victim
experiences sudden confusion and forgetfulness.
Attacks can be as brief as 30-60 minutes or can
last up to 24 hours. In severe attacks, a person is
completely disoriented and may experience retrograde amnesia that extends back several years.
While very frightening for the patient, transient
global amnesia generally has an excellent prognosis
for recovery.

Amniocentesis

KEY TERMS
Classical conditioning—The memory system that
links perceptual information to the proper motor
response. For example, Ivan Pavlov conditioned a
dog to salivate when a bell was rung.
Emotional conditioning—The memory system that
links perceptual information to an emotional
response. For example, spotting a friend in a
crowd causes a person to feel happy.
Explicit memory—Conscious recall of facts and
events that is classified into episodic memory
(involves time and place) and semantic memory
(does not involve time and place). For example,
an amnesiac may remember he has a wife (semantic memory), but cannot recall his last conversation
with her (episodic memory).
Limbic system—The brain structures involved in
memory.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)—MRI uses a
large circular magnet and radio waves to generate
signals from atoms in the body. These signals are
used to construct images of internal structures.
Motor skill learning—This memory system is associated with physical movement and activity. For
example, learning to swim is initially difficult, but
once an efficient stroke is learned, it requires little
conscious effort.
Neurodegenerative disease—A disease in which
the nervous system progressively and irreversibly
deteriorates.
Priming memory—The memory system that joins
perceptual and conceptual representations.
Transient ischemic attack—A sudden and brief
blockage of blood flow in the brain.
Working memory—The memory system that
relates to the task at hand and coordinates recall
of memories necessary to complete it.

the brain has been damaged, and blood work to exclude
treatable metabolic causes or chemical imbalances.

Treatment
Treatment depends on the root cause of amnesia
and is handled on an individual basis. Regardless of
cause, cognitive rehabilitation may be helpful in learning
strategies to cope with memory impairment.

Prognosis
Some types of amnesia, such as transient global
amnesia, are completely resolved and there is no permanent loss of memory. Others, such as Korsakoff
syndrome, associated with prolonged alcohol abuse
or amnesias caused by severe brain injury, may be
permanent. Depending on the degree of amnesia and
its cause, victims may be able to lead relatively normal
lives. Amnesiacs can learn through therapy to rely on
other memory systems to compensate for what is lost.

Prevention
Amnesia is only preventable in so far as brain
injury can be prevented or minimized. Common
sense approaches include wearing a helmet when bicycling or participating in potentially dangerous sports,
using automobile seat belts, and avoiding excessive
alcohol or drug use. Brain infections should be treated
swiftly and aggressively to minimize the damage due
to swelling. Victims of strokes, brain aneurysms, and
transient ischemic attacks should seek immediate
medical treatment.

Diagnosis
In diagnosing amnesia and its cause, doctors look
at several factors. During a physical examination, the
doctor inquires about recent traumas or illnesses, drug
and medication history, and checks the patient’s general
health. Psychological exams may be ordered to determine the extent of amnesia and the memory system
affected. The doctor may also order imaging tests such
as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to reveal whether

I Amniocentesis
Definition
Amniocentesis is a procedure used to diagnose fetal
defects in the early second trimester of pregnancy. A
sample of the amniotic fluid, which surrounds a fetus

in the womb, is collected through a pregnant woman’s
abdomen using a needle and syringe. Tests performed
on fetal cells found in the sample can reveal the presence
of many types of genetic disorders, thus allowing
doctors and prospective parents to make important
decisions about early treatment and intervention.

Purpose
Since the mid-1970s, amniocentesis has been used
routinely to test for Down syndrome, by far the most
common, nonhereditary, genetic birth defect, afflicting about one in every 1,000 babies. By 1997, approximately 800 different diagnostic tests were available,
most of them for hereditary genetic disorders such
as Tay-Sachs disease, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia,
muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis.
Amniocentesis, often called amnio, is recommended for women who will be older than 35 on
their due-date. It is also recommended for women
who have already borne children with birth defects,
or when either of the parents has a family history of a
birth defect for which a diagnostic test is available.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Another reason for the procedure is to confirm indications of Down syndrome and certain other defects
which may have shown up previously during routine
maternal blood screening.
The risk of bearing a child with a nonhereditary
genetic defect such as Down syndrome is directly
related to a woman’s age–the older the woman, the
greater the risk. Thirty-five is the recommended age to
begin amnio testing because that is the age at which the
risk of carrying a fetus with such a defect roughly
equals the risk of miscarriage caused by the procedure–about one in 200. At age 25, the risk of giving
birth to a child with this type of defect is about one in
1,400; by age 45 it increases to about one in 20. Nearly
half of all pregnant women over 35 in the United States
undergo amniocentesis and many younger women also
decide to have the procedure. Notably, some 75% of all
Down syndrome infants born in the United States each
year are to women younger than 35.
One of the most common reasons for performing
amniocentesis is an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP) test. Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein produced
161

Amniocentesis

KEY TERMS
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)—A protein normally produced by the liver of a fetus and detectable in maternal blood samples. AFP screening measures the
amount of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood. Levels
outside the norm may indicate fetal defects.
Anencephaly—A hereditary defect resulting in the
partial to complete absence of a brain and spinal
cord. It is fatal.
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS)—A procedure
similar to amniocentesis, except that cells are
taken from the chorionic membrane for testing.
These cells, called chorionic villus cells, eventually
become the placenta. The samples are collected
either through the abdomen, as in amnio, or
through the vagina. CVS can be done earlier in the
pregnancy than amnio, but carries a somewhat
higher risk.
Chromosome—Chromosomes are the strands of
genetic material in a cell that occur in nearly
identical pairs. Normal human cells contain 23
chromosome pairs–one in each pair inherited
from the mother, and one from the father. Every
human cell contains the exact same set of
chromosomes.
Down syndrome—The most prevalent of a class of
genetic defects known as trisomies, in which cells
contain three copies of certain chromosomes rather

by the fetus and present in the mother’s blood. A
simple blood screening, usually conducted around
the 15th week of pregnancy, can determine the AFP
levels in the mother’s blood. Levels that are too high or
too low may signal possible fetal defects. Because this
test has a high false-positive rate, another test such as
amnio is recommended whenever the AFP levels fall
outside the normal range.
Amniocentesis is generally performed during the
16th week of pregnancy, with results usually available
within three weeks. It is possible to perform an amnio
as early as the 11th week but this is not usually
recommended because there appears to be an
increased risk of miscarriage when done at this time.
The advantage of early amnio and speedy results lies
in the extra time for decision making if a problem is
detected. Potential treatment of the fetus can begin
earlier. Important, also, is the fact that elective abortions are safer and less controversial the earlier they
are performed.
162

than the usual two. Down syndrome, or trisomy 21,
usually results from three copies of chromosome 21.
Genetic—The term refers to genes, the basic units of
biological heredity, which are contained on the
chromosomes, and contain chemical instructions
which direct the development and functioning of
an individual.
Hereditary—Something which is inherited–passed
down from parents to offspring. In biology and medicine, the word pertains to inherited genetic
characteristics.
Maternal blood screening—Maternal blood screening is normally done early in pregnancy to test for a
variety of conditions. Abnormal amounts of certain
proteins in a pregnant woman’s blood raise the probability of fetal defects. Amniocentesis is recommended if such a probability occurs.
Tay-Sachs disease—An inherited disease prevalent
among the Ashkenazi Jewish population of the
United States. Infants with the disease are unable to
process a certain type of fat which accumulates in
nerve and brain cells, causing mental and physical
retardation, and death by age four.
Ultrasound—A technique which uses highfrequency sound waves to create a visual image (a
sonogram) of soft tissues. The technique is routinely
used in prenatal care and diagnosis.

Precautions
As an invasive surgical procedure, amnio poses a
real, although small, risk to the health of a fetus.
Parents must weigh the potential value of the knowledge gained, or indeed the reassurance that all is well,
against the small risk of damaging what is in all probability a normal fetus. The serious emotional and
ethical dilemmas that adverse test results can bring
must also be considered. The decision to undergo
amnio is always a matter of personal choice.

Description
The word amniocentesis literally means ‘‘puncture
of the amnion,’’ the thin-walled sac of fluid in which a
developing fetus is suspended during pregnancy.
During the sampling procedure, the obstetrician inserts
a very fine needle through the woman’s abdomen into
the uterus and amniotic sac and withdraws approximately one ounce of amniotic fluid for testing. The
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The physician uses ultrasound images to guide
needle placement and collect the sample, thereby
minimizing the risk of fetal injury and the need for
repeated needle insertions. Once the sample is collected, the woman can return home after a brief
observation period. She may be instructed to rest
for the first 24 hours and to avoid heavy lifting for
two days.
The sample of amniotic fluid is sent to a laboratory where fetal cells contained in the fluid are isolated
and grown in order to provide enough genetic material
for testing. This takes about seven to 14 days. The
material is then extracted and treated so that visual
examination for defects can be made. For some disorders, like Tay-Sachs, the simple presence of a telltale
chemical compound in the amniotic fluid is enough to
confirm a diagnosis. Depending on the specific tests
ordered, and the skill of the lab conducting them, all
the results are available between one and four weeks
after the sample is taken.
Cost of the procedure depends on the doctor, the
lab, and the tests ordered. Most insurers provide coverage for women over 35, as a follow-up to positive
maternal blood screening results, and when genetic
disorders run in the family.
An alternative to amnio, now in general use, is
chorionic villus sampling, or CVS, which can be performed as early as the eighth week of pregnancy.
While this allows for the possibility of a first trimester
abortion, if warranted, CVS is apparently also riskier
and is more expensive. The most promising area of
new research in prenatal testing involves expanding
the scope and accuracy of maternal blood screening
as this poses no risk to the fetus.

Preparation
It is important for a woman to fully understand
the procedure and to feel confident in the obstetrician
performing it. Evidence suggests that a physician’s
experience with the procedure reduces the chance of
mishap. Almost all obstetricians are experienced in
performing amniocentesis. The patient should feel
free to ask questions and seek emotional support
before, during and after the amnio is performed.

Physical aftercare
During and immediately following the sampling
procedure, a woman may experience dizziness, nausea,
a rapid heartbeat, and cramping. Once past these
immediate hurdles, the physician will send the
woman home with instructions to rest and to report
any complications requiring immediate treatment,
including:


vaginal bleeding. The appearance of blood could
signal a problem.



premature labor. Unusual abdominal pain and/or
cramping may indicate the onset of premature labor.
Mild cramping for the first day or two following the
procedure is normal.



signs of infection. Leaking of amniotic fluid or unusual vaginal discharge, and fever could signal the
onset of infection.
Emotional aftercare

Once the procedure has been safely completed, the
anxiety of waiting for the test results can prove to be
the worst part of the process. A woman should seek
and receive emotional support from family and
friends, as well as from her obstetrician and family
doctor. Professional counseling may also prove necessary, particularly if a fetal defect is discovered.

Risks
Most of the risks and short-term side effects associated with amniocentesis relate to the sampling procedure and have been discussed above. A successful
amnio sampling results in no long-term side effects.
Risks include:


maternal/fetal hemorrhaging. While spotting in
pregnancy is fairly common, bleeding following
amnio should always be investigated.



infection. Infection, although rare, can occur after
amniocentesis. An unchecked infection can lead to
severe complications.



fetal injury. A very slight risk of injury to the fetus
resulting from contact with the amnio needle does exist.



miscarriage. The rate of miscarriage occurring
during standard, second trimester amnio appears to
be approximately 0.5%. This compares to a miscarriage rate of 1% for CVS. Many fetuses with severe
genetic defects miscarry naturally during the first
trimester.

health from the trauma accompanying an abnormal

I Amputation
Definition

Normal results
Negative results from an amnio analysis indicate
that everything about the fetus appears normal and
the pregnancy can continue without undue concern. A
negative result for Down syndrome means that it is
99% certain that the disease does not exist.
An overall ‘‘normal’’ result does not, however,
guarantee that the pregnancy will come to term, or
that the fetus does not suffer from some other defect.
Laboratory tests are not 100% accurate at detecting
targeted conditions, nor can every possible fetal condition be tested for.

Amputation is the intentional surgical removal of
a limb or body part. It is performed to remove diseased
tissue or relieve pain.

Purpose
Arms, legs, hands, feet, fingers, and toes can be
amputated. Most amputations involve small body
parts such as a finger, rather than an entire limb.
About 65,000 amputations are performed in the
United States each year.
Amputation is performed for the following reasons:


to remove tissue that no longer has an adequate
blood supply



to remove malignant tumors



because of severe trauma to the body part

Abnormal results
Positive results on an amnio analysis indicate the
presence of the fetal defect being tested for, with an
accuracy approaching 100%. Prospective parents are
then faced with emotionally and ethically difficult
choices regarding treatment options, the prospect of
dealing with a severely affected newborn, and the
option of elective abortion. At this point, the parents
need expert medical advice and counseling.

amputation. The goal of the surgeon is to find the
place where healing is most likely to be complete,
while allowing the maximum amount of limb to
remain for effective rehabilitation.

The surgeon makes an incision around the part to
be amputated. The part is removed, and the bone is
smoothed. A flap is constructed of muscle, connective
tissue, and skin to cover the raw end of the bone. The
flap is closed over the bone with sutures (surgical
stitches) that remain in place for about one month.
Often, a rigid dressing or cast is applied that stays in
place for about two weeks.

The greater the blood flow through an area, the
more likely healing is to occur. These tests are designed
to measure blood flow through the limb. Several or all
of them can be done to help choose the proper level of
amputation.

No single test is highly predictive of healing, but
taken together, the results give the surgeon an excellent idea of the best place to amputate.

Aftercare
After amputation, medication is prescribed for
pain, and patients are treated with antibiotics to
discourage infection. The stump is moved often to
encourage good circulation. Physical therapy and
rehabilitation are started as soon as possible, usually
within 48 hours. Studies have shown that there is a
positive relationship between early rehabilitation
and effective functioning of the stump and prosthesis. Length of stay in the hospital depends on the
severity of the amputation and the general health
of the amputee, but ranges from several days to
two weeks.
Rehabilitation is a long, arduous process, especially for above the knee amputees. Twice daily physical
therapy is not uncommon. In addition, psychological
counseling is an important part of rehabilitation.
166

Many people feel a sense of loss and grief when they
lose a body part. Others are bothered by phantom
limb syndrome, where they feel as if the amputated
part is still in place. They may even feel pain in the limb
that does not exist. Many amputees benefit from joining self-help groups and meeting others who are also
living with amputation. Addressing the emotional
aspects of amputation often speeds the physical rehabilitation process.

Risks
Amputation is major surgery. All the risks associated with the administration of anesthesia exist,
along with the possibility of heavy blood loss and
the development of blood clots. Infection is of special concern to amputees. Infection rates in amputations average 15%. If the stump becomes infected, it
is necessary to remove the prosthesis and sometimes
to amputate a second time at a higher level.
Failure of the stump to heal is another major
complication. Nonhealing is usually due to an inadequate blood supply. The rate of nonhealing varies
from 5-30% depending on the facility. Centers that
specialize in amputation usually have the lowest rates
of complication.
Persistent pain in the stump or pain in the phantom limb is experienced by most amputees to some
degree. Treatment of phantom limb pain is difficult.
Finally, many amputees give up on the rehabilitation
process and discard their prosthesis. Better fitting
prosthetics and earlier rehabilitation have decreased
the incidence of this problem. Researchers and prosthetic manufacturers continue to refine the materials
and methods used to try to improve the comfort
and function of prosthetic devices for amputees.
For example, a 2004 study showed that a technique
called the bone bridge amputation technique helped
improve comfort and stability for transtibial
amputees.

Normal results
The five-year survival rate for all lower extremity
amputees is less than 50%. For diabetic amputees, the
rate is less than 40%. Up to 50% of people who have
one leg amputated because of diabetes will lose the
other within five years. Amputees who walk using a
prosthesis have a less stable gait. Three to five percent
of these people fall and break bones because of this
instability. Although the fractures can be treated,
about one-half of amputees who suffer them then
remain wheelchair bound.

Description

I Amylase tests
Definition
Amylase is a digestive enzyme made primarily by
the pancreas and salivary glands. Enzymes are substances made and used by the body to trigger specific
chemical reactions. The primary function of the
enzyme amylase is to break down starches in food so
that they can be used by the body. Amylase testing
is usually done to determine the cause of sudden
abdominal pain.

Purpose
Amylase testing is performed to diagnose a number of diseases that elevate amylase levels. Pancreatitis,
for example, is the most common reason for a high
amylase level. When the pancreas is inflamed, amylase
escapes from the pancreas into the blood. Within six to
48 hours after the pain begins, amylase levels in the
blood start to rise. Levels will stay high for several days
before gradually returning to normal.
There are other causes of increased amylase. An
ulcer that erodes tissue from the stomach and goes
into the pancreas will cause amylase to spill into the
blood. During a mumps infection, amylase from the
inflamed salivary glands increases. Amylase is also
found in the liver, fallopian tubes, and small intestine;
inflammation of these tissues also increases levels. Gall
bladder disease, tumors of the lung or ovaries, alcohol
poisoning, ruptured aortic aneurysm, and intestinal
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Amylase testing is done on both blood and
urine. The laboratory may use any of several testing
methods that involve mixing the blood or urine sample with a substance with which amylase is known to
react. By measuring the end-product or the reaction
time, technicians can calculate the amount of amylase present in the sample. More sophisticated methods separately measure the amylase made by the
pancreas and the amylase made by the salivary
glands.
Urine testing is a better long-term monitor of
amylase levels. The kidneys quickly move extra
amylase from the blood into the urine. Urine levels
rise six to 10 hours after blood levels and stay high
longer. Urine is usually collected throughout a 2- or
24-hour time period. Results are usually available the
same day.

Preparation
In most cases, no special preparation is necessary
for a person undergoing an amylase blood test.
Patients taking longer term urine amylase tests will
be given a container and instructions for collecting
the urine at home. The urine should be refrigerated
until it is brought to the laboratory.

Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to
the puncture site until the bleeding stops reduces

bruising. Applying warm packs to the puncture site
relieves discomfort.

Normal results
Normal results vary based on the laboratory and
the method used.

Abnormal results
Eight out of ten persons with acute pancreatitis
will have high amylase levels, up to four times the
normal level. Other causes of increased amylase, such
as mumps, kidney failure, pregnancy occurring in
the abdomen but outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy), certain tumors, a penetrating ulcer, certain
complications of diabetes, and advanced pancreatic
cancer, are further investigated based on the person’s
symptoms, medical history, and the results of other
tests.
In kidney disease, the kidneys are not as efficient
at removing amylase from the blood. Amylase rises in
the blood, but stays at normal levels in the urine.
People with macroamylasia have large clumps of
amylase in their blood. These clumps are too large to
move through the kidney, so they stay in the blood.
Amylase levels in the blood will be high; levels in the
urine will be low.
Amylase levels may be low in severe liver disease
(including hepatitis), conditions in which the pancreas
fails to secrete enough enzyme for proper digestions
(pancreatic insufficiency), when toxic materials build
up in the blood during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia),
following burns, in thyroid disorders, and in advanced
cystic fibrosis. Some medications can raise or lower
levels.

Description
Amyloid proteins are manufactured by malfunctioning bone marrow. Amyloidosis, which occurs
when accumulated amyloid deposits impair normal
body function, can cause organ failure or death. It
is a rare disease, occurring in about eight of every
1,000,000 people. It affects males and females equally
and usually develops after the age of 40. At least 15
types of amyloidosis have been identified. Each one
is associated with deposits of a different kind of
protein.
Types of amyloidosis
The major forms of this disease are primary systemic, secondary, and familial or hereditary amyloidosis. There is also another form of amyloidosis
associated with Alzheimer’s disease.
Primary systemic amyloidosis usually develops
between the ages of 50 and 60. With about 2,000 new
cases diagnosed annually, primary systemic amyloidosis is the most common form of this disease in the
United States. Also known as light-chain-related amyloidosis, it may also occur in association with multiple
myeloma (bone marrow cancer).
Secondary amyloidosis is a result of chronic infection or inflammatory disease. It is often associated
with:


familial Mediterranean fever (a bacterial infection
characterized by chills, weakness, headache, and
recurring fever)



granulomatous ileitis (inflammation of the small
intestine)



Hodgkin’s disease (cancer of the lymphatic system)



leprosy



osteomyelitits (bacterial infection of bone and bone
marrow)

Definition
Amyloidosis is a progressive, incurable, metabolic
disease characterized by abnormal deposits of protein
in one or more organs or body systems.

Familial or hereditary amyloidosis is the only
inherited form of the disease. It occurs in members of
most ethnic groups, and each family has a distinctive
pattern of symptoms and organ involvement. Hereditary
amyloidosis is though to be autosomal dominant,
which means that only one copy of the defective gene
is necessary to cause the disease. A child of a parent
with familial amyloidosis has a 50-50 chance of developing the disease.
Amyloidosis can involve any organ or system in
the body. The heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal system,
and nervous system are affected most often. Other

common sites of amyloid accumulation include the
brain, joints, liver, spleen, pancreas, respiratory system,
and skin.

Causes and symptoms
The cause of amyloidosis is unknown. Most
patients have gastrointestinal abnormalities, but
other symptoms vary according to the organ(s) or
system(s) affected by the disease. Usually the affected
organs are rubbery, firm, and enlarged.
Heart
Because amyloid protein deposits can limit the
heart’s ability to fill with blood between beats, even
the slightest exertion can cause shortness of breath. If
the heart’s electrical system is affected, the heart’s
rhythm may become erratic. The heart may also be
enlarged and heart murmurs may be present.
Congestive heart failure may result.

the legs. If nerves controlling bowel function are
involved, bouts of diarrhea alternate with periods of
constipation. If the disease affects nerves that regulate
blood pressure, patients may feel dizzy or faint when
they stand up suddenly.
Liver and spleen
The most common symptoms are enlargement of
these organs. Liver function is not usually affected
until quite late in the course of the disease. Protein
accumulation in the spleen can increase the risk of
rupture of this organ due to trauma.
Gastrointestinal system
The tongue may be inflammed, enlarged, and stiff.
Intestinal movement (motility) may be reduced.
Absorption of food and other nutrients may be
impaired (and may lead to malnutrition), and there
may also be bleeding, abdominal pain, constipation,
and diarrhea.
Skin
Skin symptoms occur in about half of all cases
of primary and secondary amyloidosis and in all
cases where there is inflammation or degeneration of
the peripheral nerves. Waxy-looking raised bumps
(papules) may appear on the face and neck, in the
groin, armpits, or anal area, and on the tongue or in
the ear canals. Swelling, hemorrhage beneath the skin
(purpura), hair loss, and dry mouth may also occur.
Respiratory system

Kidneys
The feet, ankles, and calves swell when amyloidosis
damages the kidneys. The kidneys become small and
hard, and kidney failure may result. It is not unusual for
a patient to lose 20-25 pounds and develop a distaste for
meat, eggs, and other protein-rich foods. Cholesterol
elevations that don’t respond to medication and protein
in the urine (proteinuria) are common.
Nervous system
Nervous system symptoms often appear in
patients with familial amyloidosis. Inflammation and
degeneration of the peripheral nerves (peripheral neuropathy) may be present. One of four patients with
amyloidosis has carpal tunnel syndrome, a painful
disorder that causes numbness or tingling in response
to pressure on nerves around the wrist. Amyloidosis
that affects nerves to the feet can cause burning or
numbness in the toes and soles and eventually weaken
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Airways may be obstructed by amyloid deposits in
the nasal sinus, larynx and traches (windpipe).

Diagnosis
Blood and urine tests can reveal the presence of
amyloid protein, but tissue or bone-marrow biopsy
is necessary to positively diagnose amyloidosis. Once
the diagnosis has been confirmed, additional laboratory tests and imaging procedures are performed to
determine:


which type of amyloid protein is involved

which organ(s) or system(s) have been affected

how far the disease has progressed

Treatment
The goal of treatment is to slow down or stop
production of amyloid protein, eliminate existing

amyloid deposits, alleviate underlying disorders
(that give rise to secondary amyloidosis), and relieve
symptoms caused by heart or kidney damage.
Specialists in cardiology, hematology (the study of
blood and the tissues that form it), nephrology (the
study of kidney function and abnormalities), neurology (the study of the nervous system), and rheumatology (the study of disorders characterized by
inflammation or degeneration of connective tissue)
work together to assess a patient’s medical status and
evaluate the effects of amyloidosis on every part of
the body.
Colchicine (Colebenemid, Probeneaid), prednisone, (Prodium), and other anti-inflammatory drugs
can slow or stop disease progression. Bone-marrow
and stem-cell transplants can enable patients to tolerate higher and more effective doses of melphalan
(Alkeran) and other chemotherapy drugs prescribed
to combat this non-malignant disease. Surgery can
relieve nerve pressure and may be performed to correct
other symptom-producing conditions. Localized amyloid deposits can also be removed surgically. Dialysis
or kidney transplantation can lengthen and improve
the quality of life for patients whose amyloidosis
results in kidney failure. Heart transplants are rarely
performed.
Supportive measures
Although no link has been established between
diet and development of amyloid proteins, a patient
whose heart or kidneys have been affected by the
disease may be advised to use a diuretic or follow a
low-salt diet.

Prognosis
Most cases of amyloidosis are diagnosed after
the disease has reached an advanced stage. The course
of each patient’s illness is unique but death, usually
a result of heart disease or kidney failure, generally
occurs within a few years. Amyloidosis associated
by multiple myeloma usually has a poor prognosis.
Most patients with both diseases die within one to
two years.

Prevention
Genetic couseling may be helpful for patients with
hereditary amyloidosis and their families. Use of
Cholchicine in patients with familial Mediterranean
fever has successfully prevented amyloidosis.

I Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
Definition
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease
that breaks down tissues in the nervous system
(a neurodegenerative disease) of unknown cause that
affects the nerves responsible for movement. It is also
known as motor neuron disease and Lou Gehrig’s
disease, after the baseball player whose career it ended.

Description
ALS is a disease of the motor neurons, those nerve
cells reaching from the brain to the spinal cord (upper
motor neurons) and the spinal cord to the peripheral
nerves (lower motor neurons) that control muscle
movement. In ALS, for unknown reasons, these
neurons die, leading to a progressive loss of the ability
to move virtually any of the muscles in the body. ALS
affects ‘‘voluntary’’ muscles, those controlled by conscious thought, such as the arm, leg, and trunk muscles. ALS, in and of itself, does not affect sensation,
thought processes, the heart muscle, or the ‘‘smooth’’
muscle of the digestive system, bladder, and other
internal organs. Most people with ALS retain function
of their eye muscles as well. However, various forms
of ALS may be associated with a loss of intellectual
function (dementia) or sensory symptoms.
ALS progresses rapidly in most cases. It is fatal
within three years for 50% of all people affected, and
within five years for 80%. Ten percent of people with
ALS live beyond eight years.

Causes and symptoms
Causes
The symptoms of ALS are caused by the death of
motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. Normally,

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is caused by the degeneration and death of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain.
These neurons convey electrical messages from the brain to the muscles to stimulate movement in the arms, legs, trunk, neck,
and head. As motor neurons degenerate, the muscles are weakened and cannot move as effectively, leading to muscle wasting.

these neurons convey electrical messages from the
brain to the muscles to stimulate movement in the
arms, legs, trunk, neck, and head. As motor neurons
die, the muscles they enervate cannot be moved as
effectively, and weakness results. In addition, lack of
stimulation leads to muscle wasting, or loss of bulk.
Involvement of the upper motor neurons causes
spasms and increased tone in the limbs, and abnormal
reflexes. Involvement of the lower motor neurons
causes muscle wasting and twitching (fasciculations).
Although many causes of motor neuron degeneration have been suggested for ALS, none has yet been
proven responsible. Results of recent research have
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

implicated toxic molecular fragments known as free
radicals. Some evidence suggests that a cascade of
events leads to excess free radical production inside
motor neurons, leading to their death. Why free radicals should be produced in excess amounts is unclear,
as is whether this excess is the cause or the effect of
other degenerative processes. Additional agents
within this toxic cascade may include excessive levels
of a neurotransmitter known as glutamate, which may
over-stimulate motor neurons, thereby increasing
free-radical production, and a faulty detoxification
enzyme known as SOD-1, for superoxide dismutase
type 1. The actual pathway of destruction is not

known, however, nor is the trigger for the rapid degeneration that marks ALS. Further research may show
that other pathways are involved, perhaps ones even
more important than this one. Autoimmune factors or
premature aging may play some role, as could viral
agents or environmental toxins.
Two major forms of ALS are known: familial and
sporadic. Familial ALS accounts for about 10% of all
ALS cases. As the name suggests, familial ALS is
believed to be caused by the inheritance of one or
more faulty genes. About 15% of families with this
type of ALS have mutations in the gene for SOD-1.
SOD-1 gene defects are dominant, meaning only one
gene copy is needed to develop the disease. Therefore,
a parent with the faulty gene has a 50% chance of
passing the gene along to a child.
Sporadic ALS has no known cause. While many
environmental toxins have been suggested as causes,
to date no research has confirmed any of the candidates investigated, including aluminum and mercury
and lead from dental fillings. As research progresses, it
is likely that many cases of sporadic ALS will be
shown to have a genetic basis as well.
A third type, called Western Pacific ALS, occurs
in Guam and other Pacific islands. This form combines symptoms of both ALS and Parkinson’s disease.
Symptoms
The earliest sign of ALS is most often weakness in
the arms or legs, usually more pronounced on one side
than the other at first. Loss of function is usually more
rapid in the legs among people with familial ALS and
in the arms among those with sporadic ALS. Leg
172

weakness may first become apparent by an increased
frequency of stumbling on uneven pavement, or an
unexplained difficulty climbing stairs. Arm weakness
may lead to difficulty grasping and holding a cup, for
instance, or loss of dexterity in the fingers.
Less often, the earliest sign of ALS is weakness in
the bulbar muscles, those muscles in the mouth and
throat that control chewing, swallowing, and speaking. A person with bulbar weakness may become
hoarse or tired after speaking at length, or speech
may become slurred.
In addition to weakness, the other cardinal signs
of ALS are muscle wasting and persistent twitching
(fasciculation). These are usually seen after weakness
becomes obvious. Fasciculation is quite common in
people without the disease, and is virtually never the
first sign of ALS.
While initial weakness may be limited to one
region, ALS almost always progresses rapidly to
involve virtually all the voluntary muscle groups in
the body. Later symptoms include loss of the ability
to walk, to use the arms and hands, to speak clearly or
at all, to swallow, and to hold the head up. Weakness
of the respiratory muscles makes breathing and
coughing difficult, and poor swallowing control
increases the likelihood of inhaling food or saliva
(aspiration). Aspiration increases the likelihood of
lung infection, which is often the cause of death.
With a ventilator and scrupulous bronchial hygiene,
a person with ALS may live much longer than the
average, although weakness and wasting will continue to erode any remaining functional abilities.
Most people with ALS continue to retain function
of the extraocular muscles that move their eyes,
allowing some communication to take place with
simple blinks or through use of a computer-assisted
device.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of ALS begins with a complete
medical history and physical exam, plus a neurological
examination to determine the distribution and extent
of weakness. An electrical test of muscle function,
called an electromyogram, or EMG, is an important
part of the diagnostic process. Various other tests,
including blood and urine tests, x rays, and CT
scans, may be done to rule out other possible causes
of the symptoms, such as tumors of the skull base or
high cervical spinal cord, thyroid disease, spinal
arthritis, lead poisoning, or severe vitamin deficiency.
ALS is rarely misdiagnosed following a careful review
of all these factors.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

There is no cure for ALS, and no treatment that
can significantly alter its course. There are many
things which can be done, however, to help maintain
quality of life and to retain functional ability even in
the face of progressive weakness.
As of the early 2000s, only one drug had been
approved for treatment of ALS. Riluzole (Rilutek)
appears to provide on average a three-month increase
in life expectancy when taken regularly early in the
disease, and shows a significant slowing of the loss of
muscle strength. Riluzole acts by decreasing glutamate release from nerve terminals. Experimental
trials of nerve growth factor have not demonstrated
any benefit. No other drug or vitamin currently available has been shown to have any effect on the course
of ALS.
A physical therapist works with an affected
person and family to implement exercise and stretching programs to maintain strength and range of
motion, and to promote general health. Swimming
may be a good choice for people with ALS, as it
provides a low-impact workout to most muscle
groups. One result of chronic inactivity is contracture, or muscle shortening. Contractures limit a person’s range of motion, and are often painful. Regular
stretching can prevent contracture. Several drugs are
available to reduce cramping, a common complaint
in ALS.
An occupational therapist can help design solutions to movement and coordination problems, and
provide advice on adaptive devices and home
modifications.
Speech and swallowing difficulties can be minimized or delayed through training provided by a
speech-language pathologist. This specialist can also
provide advice on communication aids, including
computer-assisted devices and simpler word boards.
Nutritional advice can be provided by a nutritionist. A person with ALS often needs softer foods to
prevent jaw exhaustion or choking. Later in the
disease, nutrition may be provided by a gastrostomy
tube inserted into the stomach.
Mechanical ventilation may be used when breathing becomes too difficult. Modern mechanical ventilators are small and portable, allowing a person with
ALS to maintain the maximum level of function and
mobility. Ventilation may be administered through a
mouth or nose piece, or through a tracheostomy tube.
This tube is inserted through a small hole made in the
windpipe. In addition to providing direct access to the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

airway, the tube also decreases the risk aspiration.
While many people with rapidly progressing ALS
choose not to use ventilators for lengthy periods,
they are increasingly being used to prolong life for a
short time.
The progressive nature of ALS means that most
persons will eventually require full-time nursing care.
This care is often provided by a spouse or other family
member. While the skills involved are not difficult
to learn, the physical and emotional burden of care
can be overwhelming. Caregivers need to recognize
and provide for their own needs as well as those of
people with ALS, to prevent depression, burnout, and
bitterness.
Throughout the disease, a support group can provide important psychological aid to affected persons
and their caregivers as they come to terms with the
losses ALS inflicts. Support groups are sponsored by
both the ALS Society and the Muscular Dystrophy
Association.

Alternative treatment
Given the grave prognosis and absence of traditional medical treatments, it is not surprising that a
large number of alternative treatments have been
tried for ALS. Two studies published in 1988 suggested that amino-acid therapies may provide some
improvement for some people with ALS. While individual reports claim benefits for megavitamin therapy, herbal medicine, and removal of dental fillings,
for instance, no evidence suggests that these offer
any more than a brief psychological boost, often
followed by a more severe letdown when it becomes
apparent the disease has continued unabated.
However, once the causes of ALS are better understood, alternative therapies may be more intensively
studied. For example, if damage by free radicals
turns out to be the root of most of the symptoms,
antioxidant vitamins and supplements may be used
more routinely to slow the progression of ALS. Or, if
environmental toxins are implicated, alternative
therapies with the goal of detoxifying the body may
be of some use.

Prognosis
ALS usually progresses rapidly, and leads to
death from respiratory infection within three to five
years in most cases. The slowest disease progression is
seen in those who are young and have their first symptoms in the limbs. About 10% of people with ALS live
longer than eight years.

Definition

Description
Steroids are a synthetic version of the human
hormone called testosterone. Testosterone stimulates
and maintains the male sexual organs. It also stimulates development of bones and muscle, promotes
skin and hair growth, and can influence emotions
and energy levels. In males, testosterone is produced
by the testicles and the adrenal gland. Women have
only the amount of testosterone produced by the
adrenal gland—much less than men have. This is
why testosterone is often called a ‘‘male’’ hormone.
There are more than 100 different types of anabolic
steroids that have been developed, and each requires
a prescription to be used legally in the United States.
The average adult male naturally produces 2.5 to 11
milligrams of testosterone daily. The average steroid
abuser often takes more than 100 mg a day, through
‘‘stacking’’ or combining several different brands of
steroids.
Medical uses
Anabolic steroids were first developed in the
1930s in Europe, in part to increase the physical
strength of German soldiers. Anabolic steroids were
tried by physicians for many other purposes in the
1940s and 1950s with varying success. Disadvantages
outweighed benefits for most purposes, and during the
later decades of the twentieth century medical use in
North America and Europe was restricted to a few
conditions. These include:


Bone marrow stimulation: During the second half of
the twentieth century anabolic steroids were the
mainstay of therapy for hypoplastic anemia not due
to nutrient deficiency, especially aplastic anemia.
Anabolic steroids were slowly replaced by synthetic
protein hormones that selectively stimulate growth
of blood cell precursors.



Growth stimulation: Anabolic steroids were used
heavily by pediatric endocrinologists for children
with growth failure from the 1960s through the
1980s. Availability of synthetic growth hormone
and increasing social stigmatization of anabolic steroids led to reduction of this use.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



Stimulation of appetite and preservation of muscle
mass: Anabolic steroids have been given to people
with chronic wasting conditions such as cancer and
HIV/AIDS.
Induction of male puberty: Androgens are given to
many boys distressed about extreme delay of puberty. Testosterone is as of 2005 nearly the only androgen used for this purpose, but synthetic anabolic
steroids were often used prior to the 1980s.



To treat certain kinds of breast cancer in some women.



To treat angioedema, which causes swelling of the face,
arms, legs, throat, windpipe, bowels, or sexual organs.
Abuse of steroids

The controversy surrounding steroid abuse began
in the 1950s during the Olympic Games when the
athletic community discovered that athletes from
Russia and some East European nations, which had
dominated the games, had taken large doses of steroids. Many of the male athletes developed such large
prostate glands (a gland located near the bladder and
urethra that aids in semen production) that they
needed a tube inserted in order to urinate. Some of
the female athletes developed so many male characteristics chromosome tests were necessary to prove that
they were still women. Competitive weightlifters also
began using steroids in the 1950s as a way to increase
their athletic performance. Use gradually spread
throughout the world among athletes in other sports.
Concerns over the growing illicit market and the
prevalence of abuse, combined with the possibility of
harmful long-term effects of steroids use, led the U.S.
Congress in 1991 to place anabolic steroids in
Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act
(CSA). The CSA defines anabolic steroids as any
drug or hormonal substance chemically and pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than estrogens, progestins, and corticosteroids) that promotes
muscle growth. Most illicit anabolic steroids are sold
at gyms, bodybuilding competitions, and through the
mail and Internet. For the most part, these substances
are smuggled into the United States. Anabolic steroids
commonly encountered on the illicit market include:
boldenone (Equipoise), ethlestrenol (Maxibolin),
fluoxymesterone (Halotestin), methandriol, methandrostenolone (Dianabol), methyltestosterone, nandrolone (Durabolin, DecaDurabolin), oxandrolone
(Anavar), oxymetholone (Anadrol), stanozolol
(Winstrol), testosterone (including sustanon), and
trenbolone (Finajet). In addition, a number of counterfeit products are sold as anabolic steroids.

Anabolic steroid use



Anabolic steroid use

In 2004, federal health officials initiated a crackdown on companies that manufacture, market, or
distribute products containing androstenedione, or
‘‘andro,’’ due to concerns about the safety of the substance. Widely marketed to athletes and body
builders, androstenedione has been advertised to promote muscle growth, improve muscular strength,
reduce fat, and slow aging. Androstenedione acts like
a steroid once it is metabolized by the body and can
pose similar kinds of health risks. People produce
androstenedione naturally during the making of testosterone and estrogen. When people consume
androstenedione, it is converted into testosterone
and estrogen. Scientific evidence shows that when
androstenedione is taken over time and in sufficient
quantities, it may increase the risk of serious and lifethreatening diseases, including liver failure.

breasts, and enlarged prostate glands. Women frequently show signs of masculinity and may be at higher
risk for certain types of cancer and the possibility of
birth defects in their children. Steroids fool the body
into thinking that testosterone is being produced. The
body, sensing an excess of testosterone, shuts down
bodily functions involving testosterone, such as bone
growth. The ends of long bones fuse together and stop
growing, resulting in stunted growth.

On January 20, 2005, the Anabolic Steroid Control
Act of 2004 took effect, amending the Controlled
Substance Act by placing both anabolic steroids and
prohormones on a list of controlled substances, making
possession of the banned substances a federal crime.
Also in 2005, Major League Baseball (MLB), amid
long-time rumors of anabolic steroid abuse among
players, was rocked by the publication of Juiced by
former Oakland Athletics outfielder Jose Canseco
who alleged steroid abuse was wide-spread in professional baseball. In response, Congress held hearings in
March 2005 on steroid abuse in the MLB, subpoenaing
such baseball superstars as home run champion Mark
McGwire (now retired), Sammy Sosa, and Curt
Schilling to testify. In response, MLB officials promised
a crackdown on anabolic steroid use among players.

In addition to these dangerous side effects, steroid
abuse brings other risks, some of which are connected
to the way some steroids are manufactured and distributed. The drugs are often made in motel rooms and
warehouses in Mexico, Europe, and other countries
and then smuggled into the United States. The
potency, purity, and strength of the steroids produced
this way are not regulated; therefore, users cannot
know how much they are taking. Counterfeit steroids
are also sold as the real thing. So it is often impossible
to tell exactly what some products contain.

It has been estimated that at least one in 15 male
high school seniors in the United States—more than
500,000 boys—has used steroids. Some are athletes
attempting to increase their strength and size; others
are simply youths attempting to speed up their growth
to keep pace with their peers. In some countries, anabolic steroids are available over the counter. In the
United States, a doctor’s prescription is necessary.

Causes and symptoms
While the effects of steroids can seem desirable at
first, there are serious side effects. Excessive use can
cause a harmful imbalance in the body’s normal hormonal balance and body chemistry. Heart attacks,
water retention leading to high blood pressure and
stroke, and liver and kidney tumors all are possible.
Young people may develop acne, sometimes severe,
and a halting of bone growth. Males may experience
shrinking testicles, falling sperm counts, enlarged
176

The psychological effects of steroid use are also
alarming: drastic mood swings, inability to sleep,
depression, and feelings of hostility. Steroids may
also be psychologically addictive. Once started,
users—particularly athletes—enjoy the physical socalled benefits of increased size, strength, and endurance so much that they are reluctant to stop even when
told about the risks.

Most data on the long-term effects of anabolic
steroids on humans come from case reports rather
than formal scientific studies. From the case reports,
the incidence of life-threatening effects appears to be
low, but serious adverse effects may be under-recognized or under-reported. Data from animal studies
seem to support this possibility. One study found
that exposing male mice for one-fifth of their lifespan
to steroid doses comparable to those taken by human
athletes caused a high percentage of premature deaths.
Most effects of anabolic steroid use are reversible if
the abuser stops taking the drugs, but some can be
permanent.

Diagnosis
Anyone who is using anabolic steroids without a
prescription and not under the direction of a physician
is considered abusing the drug and should seek medical help in stopping the use.

Treatment
Few studies of treatments for anabolic steroid
abuse have been conducted. Knowledge as of 2005 is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Some medications that have been used for treating
steroid withdrawal restore the hormonal system after
its disruption by steroid abuse. Other medications target specific withdrawal symptoms, for example, antidepressants to treat depression, and analgesics (pain
killers, such as aspirin and ibuprofen) for headaches
and muscle and joint pains. Some patients require assistance beyond simple treatment of withdrawal symptoms and are treated with behavioral therapies.

Alternative treatment
There is little data on alternative medicines or
treatments for anabolic steroid abuse. However, anabolic steroid manufacturers recommend saw palmetto
to be taken in conjunction with androstenedione as it
can help reduce associated hair loss and is useful in
controlling prostate enlargement.

Prognosis
Anabolic steroid abuse is a treatable condition
and can be stopped. Teenagers and adults can overcome the problem with the help of parents and other
family members, support groups, psychotherapy,
medication, treatment programs, and family counseling. These programs are customized to help teens and
adults lead productive and normal lives. However,
heavy steroid use—even if it is stopped after a few
years—may increase the risk of liver cancer. A steroid
user who quits may suffer a side effect commonly linked
to low testosterone—severe depression—which can
lead to suicidal thoughts and even suicide. The risk of
depression and suicide is highest among teens.
Some physicians recommend that athletes using
steroids avoid sudden discontinuance of all steroids at
the same time because their bodies may enter an
immediate catabolic (sudden release of energy)
phase. The cortisone receptors will be free and in
combination with the low testosterone and androgen
levels, a considerable loss of strength and mass, and an
increase of fat and water, and often breast enlargement in males can occur. Breast enlargement is possible because the suddenly low androgen level shifts the
relationship in favor of the estrogens which suddenly
become the domineering hormone.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Prevention
The best prevention is education to alert young
people to the dangers, both medical and legal, in the
illegal use of anabolic steroids. In its effort to alert
teenagers to the dangers of steroid abuse, the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) developed a
series of pamphlets, posters, and public service
announcements. Much of this information is available
on-line at <http://www.fda.gov>. Anabolic steroids
are in the same regulatory category as cocaine, heroin,
LSD, and other habit-forming drugs. This means that,
in addition to the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Agency
(DEA) helps to enforce laws relating to their abuse.
Athletic organizations have joined the fight. The
Olympic Games are now closely monitored to prevent
athletes who use steroids from participating. The
National Football League has a strict testing policy
in its training camps; it delivers fines and suspensions
to those who test positive and bans repeat offenders.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association, too, has
established stricter measures for testing and disciplining steroid users.

infection. Body sites that have tissue destruction
(necrosis) or a poor blood supply are low in oxygen
and favor the growth of anaerobic bacteria. The low
oxygen condition can result from blood vessel disease,
shock, injury, and surgery.
Anaerobic bacteria can cause infection practically
anywhere in the body. For example:


Mouth, head, and neck. Infections can occur in the
root canals, gums (gingivitis), jaw, tonsils, throat,
sinuses, and ears.



Lung. Anaerobic bacteria can cause pneumonia, lung
abscesses, infecton of the lining of the lung
(empyema), and dilated lung bronchi (bronchiectasis).



Intraabdominal. Anaerobic infections within the
abdomen include abscess formation, peritonitis, and
appendicitis.



Female genital tract. Anaerobic bacteria can cause
pelvic abscesses, pelvic inflammatory disease, inflammation of the uterine lining (endometritis), and pelvic
infections following abortion, childbirth, and surgery.



Skin and soft tissue. Anaerobic bacteria are common
causes of diabetic skin ulcers, gangrene, destructive
infection of the deep skin and tissues (necrotizing
fascitis), and bite wound infections.



Central nervous system. Anaerobic bacteria can
cause brain and spinal cord abscesses.



Bloodstream. Anaerobic bacteria can be found in the
bloodstream of ill patients (a condition called
bacteremia).

I Anaerobic infections
Definition
An anaerobic infection is an infection caused by
bacteria (called anaerobes) which cannot grow in the
presence of oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria can infect
deep wounds, deep tissues, and internal organs where
there is little oxygen. These infections are characterized by abscess formation, foul-smelling pus, and tissue destruction.

Description
Anaerobic means ‘‘life without air.’’ Anaerobic
bacteria grow in places which completely, or almost
completely, lack oxygen. They are normally found in
the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina, and on
the skin. Commonly known diseases caused by anaerobic bacteria include gas gangrene, tetanus, and botulism. Nearly all dental infections are caused by
anaerobic bacteria.
Anaerobic bacteria can cause an infection when a
normal barrier (such as skin, gums, or intestinal wall)
is damaged due to surgery, injury, or disease. Usually,
the immune system kills any invading bacteria, but
sometimes the bacteria are able to grow and cause an
178

Causes and symptoms
People who have experienced shock, injury, or
surgery, and those with blood vessel disease or
tumors are at an increased risk for infection by anaerobic bacteria. There are many different kinds of
anaerobic bacteria which can cause an infection.
Indeed, most anaerobic infections are ‘‘mixed infections’’ which means that there is a mixture of different bacteria growing. The anaerobic bacteria that
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The signs and symptoms of anaerobic infection can
vary depending on the location of the infection. In general, anaerobic infections result in tissue destruction, an
abscess which drains foul-smelling pus, and possibly
fever. Symptoms for specific infections are as follows:


Tooth and gum infections. Swollen, tender bleeding
gums, bad breath, and pain. Severe infections may
produce oozing sores.



Throat infection. An extremely sore throat, bad
breath, a bad taste in the mouth, fever, and a sense
of choking.



Lung infection. Chest pain, coughing, difficulty breathing, fever, foul-smelling sputum, and weight loss.



Intraabdominal infection. Pain, fever, and possibly,
if following surgery, foul- smelling drainage from the
wound.



Pelvic infection. Foul-smelling pus or blood draining
from the uterus, general or localized pelvic pain,
fever, and chills.



Skin and soft tissue infection. Infected wounds are
red, painful, swollen, and may drain a foul-smelling
pus. Skin infection causes localized swelling, pain,
redness, and possibly a painful, open sore (ulcer)
which drains foul-smelling pus. Severe skin infections
may cause extensive tissue destruction (necrosis).



Bloodstream. Bloodstream invasion causes high
fever (up to 1058F [40.68C]), chills, a general ill feeling, and is potentially fatal.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of anaerobic infection is based primarily on symptoms, the patient’s medical history,
and location of the infection. A foul-smelling infection
or drainage from an abscess is diagnostic of anaerobic
infection. This foul smell is produced by anaerobic
bacteria and occurs in one third to one half of patients
late in the infection. Other clues to anaerobic infection
include tissue necrosis and gas production at the infection
site. A sample from the infected site may be obtained,
using a swab or a needle and syringe, to determine which
bacteria is (are) causing the infection. Because these bacteria can be easily killed by oxygen, they rarely grow in
the laboratory cultures of tissue or pus samples.
The recent medical history of the patient is helpful
in diagnosing anaerobic infection. A patient who has or
recently had surgery, dental work, tumors, blood vessel
disease, or injury are susceptible to this infection. The
failure to improve following treatment with antibiotics
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

that aren’t able to kill anaerobes is another clue that
the infection is caused by anaerobes. The location and
type of infection also help in the diagnosis.
Diagnostic tests may include blood tests to see if
bacteria are in the bloodstream and x rays to look at
internal infections.

Treatment
Serious infections may require hospitalization for
treatment. Immediate antibiotic treatment of anaerobic
infections is necessary. Laboratory testing may identify
the bacteria causing the infection and also which antibiotic will work best. Every antibiotic does not work
against all anaerobic bacteria but nearly all anaerobes
are killed by chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin), metronidazole (Flagyl or Protostat), and imipenem
(Primaxin). Other antibiotics which may be used are
clindamycin (Cleocin) or cefoxitin (Mefoxin).
Surgical removal or drainage of the abscess is
almost always required. This may involve drainage
by needle and syringe to remove the pus from a skin
abscess (called ‘‘aspiration’’). The area would be
numbed prior to the aspiration procedure. Also,
some internal abscesses can be drained using this
procedure with the help of ultrasound (a device
which uses sound waves to visualize internal organs).
This type of abscess drainage may be performed in
the doctor’s office.

Prognosis
Complete recovery should be achieved with the
appropriate surgery and antibiotic treatment.
Untreated or uncontrolled infections can cause severe
tissue and bone destruction, which would require plastic surgery to repair. Serious infections can be life
threatening.

Prevention
Although anaerobic infections can occur in anyone, good hygiene and general health may help to
prevent infections.

Anal atresia

I Anal atresia
Definition
The anus is either not present or it is in the wrong
place.

Description
There are basically two kinds of anal atresia. In
boys with high anal atresia, there may be a channel
(fistula) connecting the large intestine to either the
urethra (which delivers urine from the bladder) or
the bladder itself. In girls, the channel may connect
with the vagina. Sixty percent of children with high
anal atresia have other defects, including problems
with the esophagus, urinary tract, and bones. In low
anal atresia, the channel may open in front of the
circular mass of muscles that constrict to close the
anal opening (anal sphincter) or, in boys, below
the scrotum. Occasionally, the intestine ends just
under the skin. It is estimated that overall abnormalities of the anus and rectum occur in about one in every
5,000 births and are slightly more common among
boys. A mother who has one child with these kind of
conditions has a 1% chance of having another child
who suffers from this ailment.

Causes and symptoms
Anal atresia is a defect in the development of the
fetus. The cause is unknown, but genetics seem to play
a minor role.

KEY TERMS
Anus—The canal at the end of the large intestine
through which waste is excreted to the outside of
the body.
Bowel obstruction—Anything that prevents waste
from moving normally to the anal opening.
Colostomy—An operation where the large intestine is diverted through an opening in the abdomen
and waste is excreted.
Feces—Bodily waste material that normally passes
through the anus.
Fistula—An abnormal channel that connects two
organs or connects an organ to the skin.

made, a surgical incision is made in the large intestine
to make a temporary opening (colostomy) in the abdomen where waste is excreted. Several months later, the
intestine is moved into the ring of muscle (sphincter)
that is part of the anus and a hole is made in the skin.
The colostomy is closed several weeks later. In low anal
atresia, immediately after diagnosis, a hole is made in
the skin to open the area where the anus should be. If
the channel is in the wrong place, the intestine is
moved into the correct position sometime during the
child’s first year. After surgery, the pediatric surgeon
uses an instrument to dilate or widen the rectum and
teaches the parents how to do this daily at home to
prevent scar tissue from contracting.

Diagnosis
Usually a physician can make an obvious visual
diagnosis of anal atesia right after birth. Occasionally,
however, anal atresia is missed until the baby is fed and
signs of intestinal obstruction appear. At the end of the
first or second day, the abdomen swells and there is
vomiting of fecal material. To determine the type of
anal atresia and the exact position, x rays will be taken
which include injecting opaque dye into the opening.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography scans (CT), as well as ultrasound, are the imaging techniques used to determine the type and size of
the anal atresia. Ultrasound uses sound waves, CT
scans pass x rays through the body at different angles,
and an MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves.

Treatment
Surgery is the only treatment for anal atresia. For
high anal atresia, immediately after the diagnosis is
180

Prognosis
With high anal atresia, many children have problems controlling bowel function. Most also become
constipated. With low anal atresia, children generally
have good bowel control, but they may still become
constipated.

Prevention
There is no known way to prevent anal atresia.

Definition
Anal cancer is an uncommon form of cancer
affecting the anus. The anus is the inch-and-a-halflong end portion of the large intestine, which opens
to allow solid wastes to exit the body. Other parts of
the large intestine include the colon and the rectum.

Description
Different cancers can develop in different parts of
the anus, part of which is inside the body and part of
which is outside. Sometimes abnormal changes of the
anus are harmless in their early stages but may later
develop into cancer. Some anal warts, for example,
contain precancerous areas and can develop into cancer. Types of anal cancer include:

KEY TERMS
Biopsy—A procedure in which a small piece of
body tissue is removed and examined under a
microscope for cancer.
Chemotherapy—A cancer treatment in which drugs
delivered into the blood stream kill cancer cells or
make them more vulnerable to radiation therapy.
Human papillomavirus (HPV)—A virus with many
subtypes, some of which cause cell changes that
increase the risk of certain cancers.
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—The virus
that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS).
Lymph nodes—Bean-shaped structures found
throughout the body that produce and store
infection-fighting cells.

Squamous Cell Carcinomas. Approximately half of
anal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, which
arise from the cells lining the anal margin and the
anal canal. The anal margin is the part of the anus
that is half inside and half outside the body, and the
anal canal is the part of the anus that is inside the
body. The earliest form of squamous cell carcinoma
is known as carcinoma in situ, or Bowen’s disease.

Radiation therapy—A cancer treatment that uses
high-energy rays to kill or weaken cancer cells.
Radiation may be delivered externally or internally
via surgically implanted pellets.



Cloacogenic Carcinomas. Approximately onefourth to one-third of anal tumors are cloacogenic
carcinomas. These tumors develop in the transitional
zone, or cloaca, which is a ring of tissue between the
anal canal and the rectum.



Adenocarcinomas. About 15% of anal cancers are
adenocarcinomas, which affect glands in the anal
area. One type of adenocarcinoma that can occur in
the anal area is called Paget’s disease, which can also
affect the vulva, breasts, and other areas of the body.



Skin cancers. A small percentage of anal cancers are
either basal cell carcinomas, or malignant melanomas, two types of skin cancer. Malignant melanomas, which develop from skin cells that produce the
brown pigment called melanin, are far more common
on areas of the body exposed to the sun.

The exact cause of most anal cancers is unknown,
although certain individuals appear to have a higher
risk of developing the disease. Smokers are at higher
risk, as are individuals with certain types of the human
papillomavirus (HPV), and those with long-term problems in the anal area, such as abnormal openings
known as fistulas. Since it increases the risk of HPV
infection, the practice of anal sex appears to increase
the risk of anal cancer—male homosexuals who practice anal sex are about 33 times more likely to have
anal cancers than heterosexual men. Those with weakened immune systems, such individuals with HIV, or
transplant patients taking immunosuppressant drugs,
are also at higher risk. Most individuals with anal
cancer are over the age of 50.



Approximately 3,500 Americans will be diagnosed with anal cancer in 2001, and an estimated 500
individuals will die of the disease during this same
interval, according to the American Cancer Society.
Anal cancers are fairly rare: they make up only 1% to
2% of cancers affecting the digestive system. The disease affects women somewhat more often than men,
although the number of cases among men, particularly
homosexual men, seems to be increasing.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Causes and symptoms

Symptoms of anal cancer resemble those found in
other harmless conditions. They include pain, itching
and bleeding, straining during a bowel movement,
change in bowel habits, change in the diameter of the
stool, discharge from the anus, and swollen lymph
nodes in the anal or groin area.

Diagnosis
Anal cancer is sometimes diagnosed during routine physicals, or during minor procedures such as
181

Anal cancer

I Anal cancer

Anal cancer

hemorrhoid removal. It may also be diagnosed during
a digital rectal examination (DRE), when a physician
inserts a gloved, lubricated finger into the anus to
feel for unusual growths. Individuals over the age of
50 who have no symptoms should have a digital rectal
examination (DRE) every five to 10 years, according
to American Cancer Society (ACS) guidelines for early
detection of colorectal cancer.
Other diagnostic procedures for anal cancer
include: Anoscopy. A procedure that involves use of a
special device to examine the anus. Proctoscopy. A
procedure that involves use of a lighted scope to see
the anal canal. Transrectal ultrasound. A procedure in
which sound waves are used to create an image of the
anus and nearby tissues.
A biopsy is performed on any suspicious growths;
that is, a tiny piece of the growth is examined under a
microscope for cancer cells. The physician may also
perform a procedure called a fine needle aspiration
biopsy, in which a needle is used to withdraw fluid
from lymph nodes located near the growth, to make
sure the cancer has not spread to these nodes.
Anal cancer severity is categorized by the following stages:


Stage 0 anal cancer is found only in the top layer of
anal tissue.



Stage I anal cancer has spread beyond the top layer
of anal tissue, but is less than 1 inch in diameter.



Stage II anal cancer has spread beyond the top layer
of anal tissue and is larger than 1 inch in diameter,
but has not spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes.



Stage IIIA anal cancer has spread to the lymph nodes
around the rectum or to nearby organs such as the
vagina or bladder.





Stage IIIB anal cancer has spread to lymph nodes in
the mid-abdomen or groin, or to nearby organs and
the lymph nodes around the rectum.
Stage IV anal cancer has spread to distant lymph
nodes within the abdomen or to distantorgans.

Treatment
Anal cancer is treated using three methods, used
either in concert or individually: surgery, radiation
therapy, and chemotherapy.
Two types of surgery may be performed. A local
resection, performed if the cancer has not spread,
removes the tumor and an area of tissue around
the tumor. An abdominoperineal resection is a more
complex procedure in which the anus and the lower
182

rectum are removed, and an opening called a colostomy is created for body wastes to exit. This procedure
is fairly uncommon today because radiation and
chemotherapy are just as effective.
Chemotherapy fights cancer using drugs, which
may be delivered via pill or needle. Some chemotherapy types kill cancer cells directly, while others act
indirectly by making cancer cells more vulnerable to
radiation. The main drugs used to treat anal cancer
are 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin or 5-FU
and cisplatin. Side effects of chemotherapy, which
damages normal cells in addition to cancer cells, may
include nausea and vomiting, hair loss, loss of appetite,
diarrhea, mouth sores, fatigue, shortness of breath,
and a weakened immune system.

Alternative treatment
Research suggests acupuncture can help manage
chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting and control pain associated with surgery.

Prognosis
Anal cancer is often curable. The chance of recovery
depends on the cancer stage and the patient’s general
health.

Prevention
Reducing the risks of the sexually transmitted diseases HPV and HIV also reduces the risk of anal
cancer. In addition, quitting smoking lowers the risk
of anal cancer.

including the penis and vagina. Studies have shown
that roughly 75% of those who engage in sexual contact with someone infected with condyloma acuminata
will develop these warts within three months.

Treatment

I Anal warts
Definition
Anal warts, also known as condyloma acuminata,
are small warts that can occur in the rectum.

Description
Initially appear as tiny blemishes that can be as
small as the head of a pin or grow into larger cauliflower-like protuberances. They can be yellow, pink,
or light brown in color, and only rarely are painful or
uncomfortable. In fact, infected individuals often are
unaware that they exist. Most cases are caused by
sexual transmission.
Most individuals have between one to 10 genital
warts thtat range in size from roughly 0.5–1.9 cm2.
Some will complain of painless bumps or itching, but
often, these warts can remain completely unnoticed.

Causes and symptoms
Condyloma acuminatum is one of the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United
States. Young adults aged 17 to 33 years are at greatest
risk. Risk factors include smoking, using oral contraceptives, having multiple sexual partners, and an early
coital age. In addition, individuals who have a history of
immunosuppression or anal intercourse are also at risk.
Roughly 90% of all anal warts are caused by the
human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11, which
are the least likely of over 60 types of HPV to become
cancerous. Anal warts are usually transmitted through
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

According to guidelines from the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC), the treatment of all genital warts, including anal warts, should be conducted according to the
methods preferred by the patient, the medications or
procedures most readily available, and the experience
of the patient’s physician in removing anal warts.
Treatment options include electrical cautery, surgical removal, or both. Warts that appear inside the
anal canal will almost always be treated with cauterization or surgical removal. Surgical removal, also
known as excision, has the highest success rates and
lowest recurrence rates. Indeed, studies have shown
that initial cure rates range from 63–91%.
Unfortunately, most cases require numerous
treatments because the virus that causes the warts
can live in the surrounding tissue. The area may seem
normal and wart-free for six months or longer before
another wart develops.
Electrocoagulation, a technique that uses electrical energy to destroy the warts, is usually the most
painful of the procedures done to eliminate condyloma acuminata of the anus, and is usually reserved
for larger warts. It is done with local anesthesia, and
may cause discharge or bleeding from the anus.
Follow-up visits to the physician are necessary to
make sure that the warts have not recurred. It is
recommended that these patients see their physicians
every three to six months for up to 1.5 years, which is
how long the incubation period is for the HPV virus.
Carbon dioxide laser treatment and electrodesiccation are other options, but these are usually reserved for
extensive warts or those that continue to recur despite
numerous treatments. However, because HPV virus can

For small warts that affect only the skin around
the anus, several medications are available, which can
be applied directly to the surface of the warts by a
physician or by the patients themselves.
Such medications include podophyllum resin
(Podocon-25, Pod-Ben-25), a substance made from
the cytotoxic extracts of several plants. This agent
offers a cure rate of 20–50% when used alone, and is
applied by the physician weekly and then washed off
6 hours later by the patient.
Podofilox (Condylox) is another agent, and is
available for patients to use at home. It can be applied
twice daily for up to 4 weeks. Podofilox offers a
slightly higher cure rate than podophyllin, and can
also be used to prevent warts.
Trichloroacetic and bichloroacetic acids are available in several concentrations up to 80% for the treatment of condyloma acuminata. These acids work to
cauterize the skin, and are quite caustic. Nevertheless,
they cause less irritation and overall body effects than
the other agents mentioned above. Recurrence, however, is higher with these acids.
Bleomycin (Blenoxane) is another treatment
option, but it has several drawbacks. First, it must be
administered by a physician into each lesion via injection, but is can have a host of side effects, and patients
must be followed carefully by their physician.
Imiquimod 5% cream is also available for patients
to apply themselves. It is to be applied three times
weekly, for up to 16 weeks, and has been shown to
clear warts within eight to 10 weeks.
Finally, the interferon drugs, which are naturally
occurring proteins that have antiviral and antitumor
effects, are available. These include interferon alfa 2a
and 2b (Roferon, Intron A), which are to be injected
into each lesion twice a week for up to eight weeks.

of HPV (up to 1.5 years), deep lesions, undetected lesions,
virus present in surrounding skin that is not treated.

Prevention
Sexual abstinence and monogamous relationships
can be the most effective form of prevention, and
condoms may also decrease the chances of transmission of condyloma acuminata. Abstinence from sexual
relations with people who have anal or genital warts
can prevent infection. Unfortunately, since many people may not be aware that they have this condition,
this is not always possible.
Individuals infected with anal warts should have
follow-up checkups every few weeks after their initial
treatment, after which self-exams can be done.
Sexual partners of people who have anal warts
should also be examined, as a precautionary preventive measure.
Finally, 5-flourouracil (Adrucil, Efudex, Fluoroplex) may be useful to prevent recurrence once the
warts have been removed. Treatment must, however,
be initiated within 1 month of wart removal.

Prognosis
Once a diagnosis of anal warts has been made,
further outbreaks can be controlled or sometimes prevented with proper care. Unfortunately, many cases of
anal warts either fail to respond to treatment or recur.
Patients have to undergo roughly six to nine treatments over several months to assure that the warts
are completely eradicated.
Recurrence rates have been estimated to be over
50% after one year and may be due to the long incubation

I Analgesics
Definition
Analgesics are medicines that relieve pain.

Purpose
Analgesics are those drugs that mainly provide
pain relief. The primary classes of analgesics are the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Description
Pain has been classified as ‘‘productive’’ pain and
‘‘non-productive’’ pain. While this distinction has
no physiologic meaning, it may serve as a guide to
treatment. ‘‘Productive’’ pain has been described as a
warning of injury, and so may be both an indication of
need for treatment and a guide to diagnosis. ‘‘Nonproductive’’ pain by definition serves no purpose
either as a warning or diagnostic tool.
Although pain syndromes may be dissimilar, the
common factor is a sensory pathway from the affected
organ to the brain. Analgesics work at the level of the
nerves, either by blocking the signal from the peripheral nervous system, or by distorting the interpretation
by the central nervous system. Selection of an appropriate analgesic is based on consideration of the riskbenefit factors of each class of drugs, based on type of
pain, severity of pain, and risk of adverse effects.
Traditionally, pain has been divided into two classes,
acute and chronic, although severity and projected
patient survival are other factors that must be considered in drug selection.
Acute pain
Acute pain is self limiting in duration, and
includes post-operative pain, pain of injury, and childbirth. Because pain of these types is expected to be
short term, the long-term side effects of analgesic therapy may routinely be ignored. Thus, these patients
may safely be treated with narcotic analgesics without
concern about possible addiction, or NSAIDs with
only limited concern for the risk of ulcers. Drugs and
doses should be adjusted based on observation of
healing rate, switching patients from high to low
doses, and from narcotic analgesics to non-narcotics
when circumstances permit.
An important consideration of pain management
in severe pain is that patients should not be subject to
the return of pain. Analgesics should be dosed
adequately to ensure that the pain is at least tolerable,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS
Acute pain—Pain that is usually temporary and
results from something specific, such as a surgery,
an injury, or an infection.
Analgesic—Medicine used to relieve pain.
Chronic pain—Pain that lasts more than three
months and threatens to disrupt daily life.
Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat
that usually develop in response to injury or illness.
Osteoarthritis—Joint pain resulting from damage
to the cartilage.

and frequently enough to avoid the anxiety that
accompanies the anticipated return of pain.
Analgesics should never be dosed on an as needed
basis, but should be administered often enough to
assure constant blood levels of analgesic. This applies
to both the narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics.
Chronic pain
Chronic pain, pain lasting over three months and
severe enough to impair function, is more difficult to
treat, since the anticipated side effects of the analgesics
are more difficult to manage. In the case of narcotic
analgesics this means the addiction potential, as well
as respiratory depression and constipation. For the
NSAIDs, the risk of gastric ulcers limit dose. While
some classes of drugs, such as the narcotic agonist/
antagonist drugs bupronophine, nalbuphine and pentazocine, and the selective COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and
rofecoxib represent advances in reduction of adverse
effects, they are still not fully suitable for long-term
management of severe pain. Generally, chronic pain
management requires a combination of drug therapy,
life-style modification, and other treatment modalities.
Narcotic analgesics
The narcotic analgesics, also termed opioids, are
all derived from opium. The class includes morphine,
codeine, and a number of semi-synthetics including
meperidine (Demerol), propoxyphen (Darvon) and
others. The narcotic analgesics vary in potency, but all
are effective in treatment of visceral pain when used
in adequate doses. Adverse effects are dose related.
Because these drugs are all addictive, they are controlled
under federal and state laws. A variety of dosage forms
are available, including oral solids, liquids, intravenous
and intrathecal injections, and transcutaneous patches.
185

Analgesics

narcotics, including additional agents that are chemically based on the morphine molecule but have minimal abuse potential; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs) including the salicylates; and acetaminophen. Other drugs, notably the tricyclic antidepressants and anti-epileptic agents such as gabapentin, have
been used to relieve pain, particularly neurologic pain,
but are not routinely classified as analgesics. Analgesics
provide symptomatic relief, but have no effect on the
cause, although clearly the NSAIDs, by virtue of their
dual activity, may be beneficial in both regards.

Analgesics, opioid

NSAIDs are effective analgesics even at doses too
low to have any anti-inflammatory effects. There are a
number of chemical classes, but all have similar therapeutic effects and side effects. Most are appropriate
only for oral administration; however ketorolac
(Toradol) is appropriate for injection and may be
used in moderate to severe pain for short periods.
Acetaminophen is a non-narcotic analgesic with no
anti-inflammatory properties. It is appropriate for mild
to moderate pain. Although the drug is well tolerated in
normal doses, it may have significant toxicity at high
doses. Because acetaminophen is largely free of side
effects at therapeutic doses, it has been considered the
first choice for mild pain, including that of osteoarthritis.
Topical analgesics (topical being those that are
applied on the skin) have become much more popular
in recent years. Those applied for local effect include
capsaicin, methylsalicylate, and transdermal lidocaine.
Transdermal fentanyl may be applied for systemic (the
entire body in general) effect. In some cases, these
topical agents reduce the need for drug therapy. Sales
of pain relief patches have increased substantially in
recent years. They are particularly useful for elderly
patients who may not want to take a lot of tablets.

Recommended dosage
Appropriate dosage varies by drug, and should
consider the type of pain, as well as other risks associated with patient age and condition. For example,
narcotic analgesics should usually be avoided in
patients with a history of substance abuse, but may be
fully appropriate in patients with cancer pain. Similarly,
because narcotics are more rapidly metabolized in
patients who have used these drugs for a long period,
higher than normal doses may be needed to provide
adequate pain management. NSAIDs, although comparatively safe in adults, represent an increased risk of
gastrointestinal bleeding in patients over the age of 60.

Precautions
Narcotic analgesics may be contraindicated in
patients with respiratory depression. NSAIDS may
be hazardous to patients with ulcers or an ulcer history. They should be used with care in patients with
renal insufficiency or coagulation disorders. NSAIDs
are contraindicated in patients allergic to aspirin.

The primary adverse effects of the narcotic
analgesics are addiction, constipation, and respiratory depression. Because narcotic analgesics stimulate the production of enzymes that cause the
metabolism of these drugs, patients on narcotics for
a prolonged period may require increasing doses.
This is not the same thing as addiction, and is not a
reason for withholding medication from patients in
severe pain.
NSAIDs can lead to ulcers and may cause kidney problems. Gastrointestinal discomfort is common, although in some cases, these drugs may
cause ulcers without the prior warning of gastrointestinal distress. Platelet aggregation problems may
occur, although not to the same extent as is seen
with aspirin.

Interactions
Interactions depend on the specific type of
analgesic.

Opioids are also given to relieve the pain of terminal
cancer, diabetic neuropathy, lower back pain, and other
chronic diseases or disorders. The World Health
Organization (WHO) has established a three-stage
‘‘ladder’’ for the use of opioids in managing cancer pain.

Among the drugs in this category are codeine,
propoxyphene (Darvon), propoxyphene and acetaminophen (Darvocet N), meperidine (Demerol), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), morphine, oxycodone,
oxycodone and acetaminophen (Percocet, Roxicet),
and hydrocodone and acetaminophen (Lortab,
Anexsia). These drugs come in many forms—tablets,
syrups, suppositories, and injections, and are sold only
by prescription. For some, a new prescription is
required for each new supply—refills are prohibited
according to federal regulations.

KEY TERMS
Analgesic—Medicine used to relieve pain.
Central nervous system—The brain and spinal cord.
Colitis—Inflammation of the colon (large bowel)
Hallucination—A false or distorted perception of
objects, sounds, or events that seems real.
Hallucinations usually result from drugs or mental
disorders.
Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat
that usually develop in response to injury or illness.
Narcotic—A drug derived from opium or compounds similar to opium. Such drugs are potent
pain relievers and can affect mood and behavior.
Long-term use of narcotics can lead to dependence
and tolerance.
Tolerance—A decrease in sensitivity to a drug.
When tolerance occurs, a person must take more
and more of the drug to get the same effect.
Withdrawal symptoms—A group of physical or
mental symptoms that may occur when a person
suddenly stops using a drug to which he or she has
become dependent.

Recommended dosage
Recommended doses vary, depending on the type of
opioid analgesic and the form in which it is being used.
Doses may be different for different patients. Check with
the physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for correct dosages, and
make sure to understand how to take the drug.
Always take opioid analgesics exactly as directed.
Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do not
take the drug for longer than directed. Do not stop
taking the drug suddenly without checking with the
physician or dentist who prescribed it. Gradually
tapering the dose may the chance of withdrawal
symptoms.

Precautions
Anyone who uses opioid analgesics—or any narcotic—over a long time may become physically or
mentally dependent on the drug. Physical dependence
may lead to withdrawal symptoms when the person
stops taking the medicine. Building tolerance to these
drugs is also possible when they are used for a long
period. Over time, the body needs larger and larger
doses to relieve pain.
188

Take these drugs exactly as directed. Never take
more than the recommended dose, and do not take the
drugs more often than directed. If the drugs do not
seem to be working, consult your physician. Do not
share these or any other prescription drugs with others
because the drug may have a completely different
effect on the person for whom it was not prescribed.
Children and older people are especially sensitive
to opioid analgesics and may have serious breathing
problems after taking them. Children may also
become unusually restless or agitated when given
these drugs.
Opioid analgesics increase the effects of alcohol.
Anyone taking these drugs should not drink alcoholic
beverages.
Some of these drugs may also contain aspirin,
caffeine, or acetaminophen. Refer to the entries on
each of these drugs for additional precautions.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if they
take opioid analgesics. Before taking these drugs, be sure
to let the physician know about any of these conditions.
ALLERGIES. Let the physician know about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances
and about any previous reactions to opioid analgesics.
PREGNANCY. Women who are pregnant or plan
to become pregnant while taking opioid analgesics
should let their physicians know. No evidence exists
that these drugs cause birth defects in people, but some
do cause birth defects and other problems when given to
pregnant animals in experiments. Babies can become
dependent on opioid analgesics if their mothers use
too much during pregnancy. This can cause the baby
to go through withdrawal symptoms after birth. If
taken just before delivery, some opioid analgesics
may cause serious breathing problems in the newborn.
BREAST FEEDING. Some opioid analgesics can pass
into breast milk. Women who are breast feeding
should check with their physicians about the safety
of taking these drugs.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. These conditions
may influence the effects of opioid analgesics:


head injury. The effects of some opioid analgesics
may be stronger and may interfere with recovery in
people with head injuries.

USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking opioid narco-

tics with certain other drugs may increase the chances
of serious side effects.

Side effects
Some people experience drowsiness, dizziness,
lightheadedness, or a false sense of well-being after
taking opioid analgesics. Anyone who takes these
drugs should not drive, use machines, or do anything
else that might be dangerous until they know how the
drug affects them. Nausea and vomiting are common
side effects, especially when first beginning to take the
medicine. If these symptoms do not go away after the
first few doses, check with the physician or dentist who
prescribed the medicine.
Dry mouth is another common side effect. Dry
mouth can be relieved by sucking on sugarless hard
candy or ice chips or by chewing sugarless gum. Saliva
substitutes, which come in liquid or tablet forms, also
may help. Patients who must use opioid analgesics
over long periods and who have dry mouth should
see their dentists, as the problem can lead to tooth
decay and other dental problems.
The following side effects are less common. They
usually do not need medical attention and will go away
after the first few doses. If they continue or interfere
with normal activity, check with the physician who
prescribed the medicine.

Interactions
Anyone taking these drugs should notify his or her
physician before taking opioid analgesics:


Central nervous system (CNS) depressants, such as
antihistamines and other medicines for allergies, hay
fever, or colds; tranquilizers; some other prescription
pain relievers; seizure medicines; muscle relaxants;
sleeping pills; some anesthetics (including dental
anesthetics).



Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, such as phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). The
combination of the opioid analgesic meperidine
(Demerol) and MAO inhibitors is especially
dangerous.



Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline
(Elavil).



Anti-seizure medicines, such as carbamazepine
(Tegretol). May lead to serious side effects, including
coma, when combined with propoxyphene and acetaminophen
(Darvocet-N)
or
propoxyphene
(Darvon).



Muscle relaxants, such as cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril).



Sleeping pills, such as triazolam (Halcion).



Blood-thinning drugs, such as warfarin (Coumadin).



Naltrexone (Trexan, Revia). Cancels the effects of

Opioids may also interact with certain herbal preparations sold as dietary supplements. Among the
herbs known to interact with opioids are valerian
(Valeriana officinalis), ginseng (Panax ginseng), kava
kava (Piper methysticum), and chamomile (Matricaria
chamomilla). As of early 2004 the National Center for
Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)
is beginning a study of the possible interactions
between St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a
herb frequently used to relieve symptoms of depression, and the opioid analgesics fentanyl and oxycodone. It is just as important for patients to inform their
doctor of herbal remedies that they take on a regular
basis as it is to give the doctor a list of their other
prescription medications.

I Anaphylaxis
Definition
Anaphylaxis is a rapidly progressing, life-threatening allergic reaction.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS

Anaphylaxis is a type of allergic reaction, in which
the immune system responds to otherwise harmless
substances from the environment. Unlike other allergic reactions, however, anaphylaxis can kill. Reaction
may begin within minutes or even seconds of exposure,
and rapidly progress to cause airway constriction, skin
and intestinal irritation, and altered heart rhythms. In
severe cases, it can result in complete airway obstruction, shock, and death.

ACTH—Adrenocorticotropic hormone, a hormone
normally produced by the pituitary gland, sometimes taken as a treatment for arthritis and other
disorders.
Antibody—An immune system protein which
binds to a substance from the environment.
NSAIDs—Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs,
including aspirin and ibuprofen.
Tracheostomy tube—A tube which is inserted into
an incision in the trachea (tracheostomy) to relieve
upper airway obstruction.

Causes and symptoms
Causes
Like the majority of other allergic reactions, anaphylaxis is caused by the release of histamine and
other chemicals from mast cells. Mast cells are a type
of white blood cell and they are found in large numbers in the tissues that regulate exchange with the
environment: the airways, digestive system, and skin.
On their surfaces, mast cells display antibodies
called IgE (immunoglobulin type E). These antibodies
are designed to detect environmental substances to
which the immune system is sensitive. Substances
from a genuinely threatening source, such as bacteria
or viruses, are called antigens. A substance that most
people tolerate well, but to which others have an allergic response, is called an allergen. When IgE antibodies bind with allergens, they cause the mast cell to
release histamine and other chemicals, which spill out
onto neighboring cells.
The interaction of these chemicals with receptors
on the surface of blood vessels causes the vessels to
leak fluid into surrounding tissues, causing fluid accumulation, redness, and swelling. On the smooth muscle cells of the airways and digestive system, they cause
constriction. On nerve endings, they increase sensitivity and cause itching.
In anaphylaxis, the dramatic response is due both
to extreme hypersensivity to the allergen and its usually
systemic distribution. Allergens are more likely to cause
anaphylaxis if they are introduced directly into the
circulatory system by injection. However, exposure by
ingestion, inhalation, or skin contact can also cause
anaphylaxis. In some cases, anaphylaxis may develop
over time from less severe allergies.
Anaphylaxis is most often due to allergens in foods,
drugs, and insect venom. Specific causes include:


Fish, shellfish, and mollusks



Nuts and seeds

Anaphylaxis

Description

Anemias

Diagnosis
Anaphylaxis is diagnosed based on the rapid
development of symptoms in response to a suspect
allergen. Identification of the culprit may be done
with RAST testing, a blood test that identifies IgE
reactions to specific allergens. Skin testing may be
done for less severe anaphylactic reactions.

I Anemias
Definition
Anemia is a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin (the component of red blood cells that delivers
oxygen to tissues throughout the body).

Treatment

Description

Emergency treatment of anaphylaxis involves
injection of adrenaline (epinephrine) which constricts
blood vessels and counteracts the effects of histamine. Oxygen may be given, as well as intravenous
replacement fluids. Antihistamines may be used for
skin rash, and aminophylline for bronchial constriction. If the upper airway is obstructed, placement
of a breathing tube or tracheostomy tube may be
needed.

The tissues of the human body need a regular
supply of oxygen to stay healthy. Red blood cells,
which contain hemoglobin that allows them to deliver
oxygen throughout the body, live for only about 120
days. When they die, the iron they contain is returned
to the bone marrow and used to create new red blood
cells. Anemia develops when heavy bleeding causes
significant iron loss or when something happens to
slow down the production of red blood cells or to
increase the rate at which they are destroyed.

Prognosis

Types of anemia

The rapidity of symptom development is an indication of the likely severity of reaction: the faster
symptoms develop, the more severe the ultimate
reaction. Prompt emergency medical attention and
close monitoring reduces the likelihood of death.
Nonetheless, death is possible from severe anaphylaxis. For most people who receive rapid treatment,
recovery is complete.

Prevention
Avoidance of the allergic trigger is the only
reliable method of preventing anaphylaxis. For
insect allergies, this requires recognizing likely
nest sites. Preventing food allergies requires knowledge of the prepared foods or dishes in which the
allergen is likely to occur, and careful questioning
about ingredients when dining out. Use of a MedicAlert tag detailing drug allergies is vital to prevent
inadvertent administration during a medical
emergency.

Anemia can be mild, moderate, or severe enough
to lead to life-threatening complications. More than
400 different types of anemia have been identified.
Many of them are rare.
IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. The onset of iron deficiency anemia is gradual and, at first, there may not be
any symptoms. The deficiency begins when the body
loses more iron than it derives from food and other
sources. Because depleted iron stores cannot meet the
red blood cell’s needs, fewer red blood cells develop. In
this early stage of anemia, the red blood cells look
normal, but they are reduced in number. Then the
body tries to compensate for the iron deficiency by
producing more red blood cells, which are characteristically small in size. Symptoms develop at this stage.
FOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Folic acid anemia is especially common in infants and teenagers.
Although this condition usually results from a dietary
deficiency, it is sometimes due to inability to absorb
enough folic acid from such foods as:


cheese



eggs



fish

Smoking raises the risk of developing this condition by interfering with the absorption of Vitamin C,
which the body needs to absorb folic acid. Folic acid
anemia can be a complication of pregnancy, when a
woman’s body needs eight times more folic acid than it
does otherwise.
VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Less common in
this country than folic acid anemia, vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is another type of megaloblastic anemia
that develops when the body doesn’t absorb enough of
this nutrient. Necessary for the creation of red blood
cells, B12 is found in meat and vegetables.

Large amounts of B12 are stored in the body, so this
condition may not become apparent until as much as
four years after B12 absorption stops or slows down. The
resulting drop in red blood cell production can cause:

Pernicious anemia usually strikes between the ages
of 50–60. Eating disorders or an unbalanced diet
increase the risk of developing pernicious anemia. So do:

family history of pernicious anemia

VITAMIN C DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. A rare disorder
that causes the bone marrow to manufacture abnormally small red blood cells, Vitamin C deficiency anemia
results from a severe, long-standing dietary deficiency.
HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. Some people are born with
hemolytic anemia. Some acquire this condition, in
which infection or antibodies destroy red blood cells
more rapidly than bone marrow can replace them.

Hemolytic anemia can enlarge the spleen, accelerating the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis).
Other complications of hemolytic anemia include:


pain



shock
gallstones and other serious health problems



loss of muscle control





loss of sensation in the legs, hands, and feet



soreness or burning of the tongue



weight loss



yellow-blue color blindness

THALASSEMIAS. An inherited form of hemolytic
anemia, thalassemia stems from the body’s inability
to manufacture as much normal hemoglobin as it
needs. There are two categories of thalassemia,
depending on which of the amino acid chains is
affected. (Hemoglobin is composed of four chains of
amino acids.) In alpha-thalassemia, there is an imbalance in the production of the alpha chain of amino
acids; in beta-thalassemia, there is an imbalance in the
beta chain. Alpha-thalassemias most commonly affect
blacks (25% have at least one gene); beta-thalassemias
most commonly affect people of Mediterranean ancestry and Southeast Asians.

The most common form of B12 deficiency is pernicious anemia. Since most people who eat meat or eggs
get enough B12 in their diets, a deficiency of this vitamin usually means that the body is not absorbing it
properly. This can occur among people who have had
intestinal surgery or among those who do not produce
adequate amounts of intrinsic factor, a chemical

Characterized by production of red blood cells
that are unusually small and fragile, thalassemia only
affects people who inherit the gene for it from each
parent (autosomal recessive inheritance).



recent severe illness



long-term exposure to industrial chemicals



use of anticancer drugs and certain other medications

AUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS. Warm antibody hemolytic anemia is the most common type of
this disorder. This condition occurs when the body
produces autoantibodies that coat red blood cells.
The coated cells are destroyed by the spleen, liver, or
bone marrow.

ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. Cancer, chronic
infection or inflammation, and kidney and liver disease often cause mild or moderate anemia. Chronic
liver failure generally produces the most severe symptoms. People infected with the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS often face severe
fatigue.

Warm antibody hemolytic anemia is more common in women than in men. About one-third of
patients who have warm antibody hemolytic anemia
also have lymphoma, leukemia, lupus, or connective
tissue disease.
In cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the body
attacks red blood cells at or below normal body temperature. The acute form of this condition frequently
develops in people who have had pneumonia, mononeucleosis, or other acute infections. It tends to be
mild and short-lived, and disappears without
treatment.
Chronic cold antibody hemolytic anemia is most
common in women and most often affects those who
are over 40 and who have arthritis. This condition
usually lasts for a lifetime, generally causing few symptoms. However, exposure to cold temperatures can
accelerate red blood cell destruction, causing fatigue,
joint aches, and discoloration of the arms and hands.
SICKLE CELL ANEMIA. Sickle cell anemia is a

chronic, incurable condition that causes the body to
produce defective hemoglobin, which forces red blood
cells to assume an abnormal crescent shape. Unlike
normal oval cells, fragile sickle cells can’t hold enough
hemoglobin to nourish body tissues. The deformed
shape makes it hard for sickle cells to pass through
narrow blood vessels. When capillaries become
obstructed, a life-threatening condition called sickle
cell crisis is likely to occur.
Sickle cell anemia is hereditary. It almost always
affects blacks and people of Mediterranean descent. A
child who inherits the sickle cell gene from each parent
will have the disease. A child who inherits the sickle
cell gene from only one parent carries the sickle cell
trait, but does not have the disease.
APLASTIC ANEMIA. Sometimes curable by bone
marrow transplant, but potentially fatal, aplastic anemia is characterized by decreased production of red
and white blood cells and platelets (disc-shaped cells
that allow the blood to clot). This disorder may be
inherited or acquired as a result of:

194

Causes and symptoms
Anemia is caused by bleeding, decreased red
blood cell production, or increased red blood cell
destruction. Poor diet can contribute to vitamin deficiency and iron deficiency anemias in which fewer red
blood cells are produced. Hereditary disorders and
certain diseases can cause increased blood cell destruction. However, excessive bleeding is the most common
cause of anemia, and the speed with which blood loss
occurs has a significant effect on the severity of symptoms. Chronic blood loss is usually a consequence of:


cancer



gastrointestinal tumors



diverticulosis



polyposis



heavy menstrual flow



hemorrhoids



nosebleeds



stomach ulcers



long-standing alcohol abuse
Acute blood loss is usually the result of:



childbirth



injury



a ruptured blood vessel



surgery

When a lot of blood is lost within a short time,
blood pressure and the amount of oxygen in the body
drop suddenly. Heart failure and death can follow.
Loss of even one-third of the body’s blood volume
in the space of several hours can be fatal. More gradual blood loss is less serious, because the body has
time to create new red blood cells to replace those that
have been lost.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Weakness, fatigue, and a run-down feeling may be
signs of mild anemia. Skin that is pasty or sallow, or
lack of color in the creases of the palm, gums, nail
beds, or lining of the eyelids are other signs of anemia.
Someone who is weak, tires easily, is often out of
breath, and feels faint or dizzy may be severely anemic.
Other symptoms of anemia are:


angina pectoris (chest pain, often accompanied by a
choking sensation that provokes severe anxiety)



cravings for ice, paint, or dirt



headache



inability to concentrate, memory loss



inflammation of the mouth (stomatitis) or tongue
(glossitis)



insomnia



irregular heartbeat





sores in the mouth, throat, or rectum



sweating



swelling of the hands and feet



thirst



tinnitus (ringing in the ears)



unexplained bleeding or bruising

In pernicious anemia, the tongue feels unusually
slick. A patient with pernicious anemia may have:


problems with movement or balance



tingling in the hands and feet



confusion, depression, and memory loss

Pernicious anemia can damage the spinal cord. A
doctor should be notified whenever symptoms of this
condition occur.
A doctor should also be notified if a patient who
has been taking iron supplements develops:


diarrhea



cramps



vomiting

Diagnosis
Personal and family health history may suggest
the presence of certain types of anemia. Laboratory
tests that measure the percentage of red blood cells or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

the amount of hemoglobin in the blood are used to
confirm diagnosis and determine which type of anemia
is responsible for a patient’s symptoms. X rays and
examinations of bone marrow may be used to identify
the source of bleeding.

Treatment
Anemia due to nutritional deficiencies can usually
be treated at home with iron supplements or self administered injections of vitamin B12. People with folic
acid anemia should take oral folic acid replacements.
Vitamin C deficiency anemia can be cured by taking
one vitamin C tablet a day.
Surgery may be necessary to treat anemia caused
by excessive loss of blood. Transfusions of red blood
cells may be used to accelerate production of red blood
cells.
Medication or surgery may also be necessary to
control heavy menstrual flow, repair a bleeding ulcer,
or remove polyps (growths or nodules) from the
bowels.
Patients with thalassemia usually do not require
treatment. However people with a severe form may
require periodic hospitalization for blood transfusions
and/or bone marrow transplantation.
SICKLE CELL ANEMIA. Treatment for sickle cell
anemia involves regular eye examinations, immunizations for pneumonia and infectious diseases, and
prompt treatment for sickle cell crises and infections
of any kind. Psychotherapy or counseling may help
patients deal with the emotional impact of this
condition.
VITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. A life-long regimen of B12 shots is necessary to control symptoms of
pernicious anemia. The patient may be advised to limit
physical activity until treatment restores strength and
balance.
APLASTIC ANEMIA. People who have aplastic anemia are especially susceptible to infection. Treatment
for aplastic anemia may involve blood transfusions
and bone marrow transplant to replace malfunctioning cells with healthy ones.
ANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. There is no specific
treatment for anemia associated with chronic disease,
but treating the underlying illness may alleviate this
condition. Erythropoietin is a hormone that stimulates production of red blood cells. It is sometimes
used to treat anemia from kidney disease or cancer
chemotherapy. This type of anemia rarely becomes
severe. If it does, transfusions or hormone treatments

195

Anemias

Symptoms

to stimulate red blood cell production may be prescribed. A working group met in 2004 to address the
specific management of anemia in patients infected
with HIV.
HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. There is no specific treatment for cold-antibody hemolytic anemia. About
one-third of patients with warm-antibody hemolytic
anemia respond well to large doses of intravenous and
oral corticosteroids, which are gradually discontinued
as the patient’s condition improves. Patients with this
condition who don’t respond to medical therapy must
have the spleen surgically removed. This operation
controls anemia in about one-half of the patients on
whom it’s performed. Immune-system suppressants
are prescribed for patients whose surgery is not
successful.

Self-care
Anyone who has anemia caused by poor nutrition
should modify his or her diet to include more vitamins,
minerals, and iron. Vitamin C can stimulate iron
absorption. The following foods are also good sources
of iron:

on a deep healing level with crisis intervention when
necessary.
Many alternative therapies for iron-deficiency
anemia focus on adding iron-rich foods to the
diet or on techniques to improve circulation and
digestion. Iron supplementation, especially with
iron citrate (less likely to cause constipation), is
used by alternative practitioners. This can be given
in combination with herbs that are rich in iron.
Some examples of iron-rich herbs are dandelion
(Taraxacum officinale), parsley (Petroselinum
crispum), and nettle (Urtica dioica). The homeopathic remedy ferrum phosphoricum can also be
helpful.
An iron-rich herbal tonic can also me made using
the following recipe:


soak 1/2 oz of yellow dock root and 1/2 oz dandelion
root in 1 qt of boiled water for four to 8 hours



strain and simmer until the amount of liquid is
reduced to 1 cup



remove from heat and add 1/2 cup black strap
molasses, mixing well
store in refrigerator; take 1 tsp-2 Tbsp daily



almonds





broccoli



dried beans



dried fruits



enriched breads and cereals



lean red meat



liver



potatoes

Other herbal remedies used to treat irondeficiency anemia aim to improve the digestion.
Gentian (Gentiana lutea) is widely used in Europe to
treat anemia and other nutritionally based disorders.
The bitter qualities of gentian help stimulate the digestive system, making iron and other nutrients more
available for absorption. This bitter herb can be
brewed into tea or purchased as an alcoholic extract
(tincture).



poultry



rice

Other herbs recommended to promote digestion
include:



shellfish

anise (Pimpinella anisum)



tomatoes



caraway (Carum carvi)



cumin (Cuminum cyminum)



linden (Tilia spp.)



licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)

Because light and heat destroy folic acid, fruits
and vegetables should be eaten raw or cooked as little
as possible.

Alternative treatment
As is the case in standard medical treatment, the
cause of the specific anemia will determine the alternative treatment recommended. If the cause is a deficiency, for example iron deficiency, folic acid
deficiency, B12 deficiency, or vitamin C deficiency,
supplementation is the treatment. For extensive
blood loss, the cause should be identified and corrected. Other types of anemias should be addressed

acupuncture to stimulate a weakened spleen



asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) to restore energy



not taking medication that has triggered hemolytic
anemia and not eating foods that have caused hemolysis (breakdown of red blood cells)



receiving regular B12 shots to prevent pernicious
anemia resulting from gastritis or stomach surgery

Folic-acid and iron-deficiency anemias
It usually takes three to six weeks to correct folic
acid or iron deficiency anemia. Patients should continue taking supplements for another six months to
replenish iron reserves. They should have periodic
blood tests to make sure the bleeding has stopped
and the anemia has not recurred.
Pernicious anemia
Although pernicious anemia is considered incurable, regular B12 shots will alleviate symptoms and
reverse complications. Some symptoms will disappear
almost as soon as treatment begins.

Definition
General anesthesia is the induction of a state of
unconsciousness with the absence of pain sensation
over the entire body, through the administration of
anesthetic drugs. It is used during certain medical and
surgical procedures.

Purpose
General anesthesia has many purposes including:


pain relief (analgesia)



blocking memory of the procedure (amnesia)



producing unconsciousness



inhibiting normal body reflexes to make surgery safe
and easier to perform



relaxing the muscles of the body

Prevention
Inherited anemias cannot be prevented. Genetic
counseling can help parents cope with questions and
concerns about transmitting disease-causing genes to
their children.
Avoiding excessive use of alcohol, eating a balanced
diet that contains plenty of iron-rich foods, and taking
a daily multivitamin can help prevent anemia.

Description
Anesthesia performed with general anesthetics
occurs in four stages which may or may not be observable because they can occur very rapidly:


Stage One: Analgesia. The patient experiences
analgesia or a loss of pain sensation but remains
conscious and can carry on a conversation.



Stage Two: Excitement. The patient may experience
delirium or become violent. Blood pressure rises and

This stage is typically bypassed by administering a

Stage Three: Surgical Anesthesia. During this stage,
the skeletal muscles relax, and the patient’s breathing
becomes regular. Eye movements slow, then stop,
and surgery can begin.
Stage Four: Medullary Paralysis. This stage occurs if
the respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata of
the brain that control breathing and other vital functions cease to function. Death can result if the patient
cannot be revived quickly. This stage should never be
reached. Careful control of the amounts of anesthetics administered prevent this occurrence.

Agents used for general anesthesia may be either
gases or volatile liquids that are vaporized and inhaled
with oxygen, or drugs delivered intravenously. A combination of inhaled anesthetic gases and intravenous
drugs are usually delivered during general anesthesia;
this practice is called balanced anesthesia and is used

each anesthetic agent to reach surgical anesthesia. If

Hypnotic agent—A drug capable of inducing a
hypnotic state.
Hypnotic state—A state of heightened awareness
that can be used to modulate the perception of pain.
Hypoxia—Reduction of oxygen supply to the tissues.
Malignant hyperthermia—A type of reaction
(probably with a genetic origin) that can occur
during general anesthesia and in which the patient
experiences a high fever, muscle rigidity, and irregular heart rate and blood pressure.
Medulla oblongata—The lowest section of the
brainstem, located next to the spinal cord. The
medulla is the site of important cardiac and respiratory regulatory centers.
Opioid—Any morphine-like synthetic narcotic that
produces the same effects as drugs derived from the
opium poppy (opiates), such as pain relief, sedation, constipation and respiratory depression.
Pneumothorax—A collapse of the lung.
Stenosis—A narrowing or constriction of the diameter of a passage or orifice, such as a blood vessel.

inhaling a general anesthetic can be rapidly modified
by adjusting the concentration of the anesthetic in the
oxygen that is breathed by the patient. The degree of
anesthesia produced by an intravenously injected
anesthesic is fixed and cannot be changed as rapidly.
Most commonly, intravenous anesthetic agents are
used for induction of anesthesia and then followed
by inhaled anesthetic agents.
General anesthesia works by altering the flow of
sodium molecules into nerve cells (neurons) through
the cell membrane. Exactly how the anesthetic does
this is not understood since the drug apparently does
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

When general anesthesia was first introduced in
medical practice, ether and chloroform were inhaled
with the physician manually covering the patient’s
mouth. Since then, general anesthesia has become much
more sophisticated. During most surgical procedures,
anesthetic agents are now delivered and controlled by
computerized equipment that includes anesthetic gas
monitoring as well as patient monitoring equipment.
Anesthesiologists are the physicians that specialize in
the delivery of anesthetic agents. Currently used inhaled
general anesthetics include halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desfluorane, sevofluorane, and nitrous oxide.








Halothane (Fluothane) is a powerful anesthetic and
can easily be overadministered. This drug causes
unconsciousness but little pain relief so it is often
used with other agents to control pain. Very rarely,
it can be toxic to the liver in adults, causing death. It
also has the potential for causing serious cardiac
dysrhythmias. Halothane has a pleasant odor, and
was frequently the anesthetic of choice for use with
children, but since the introduction of sevofluorane
in the 1990s, halothane use has declined.
Enflurane (Ethrane) is less potent and results in a
more rapid onset of anesthesia and faster awakening
than halothane. In addition, it acts as an enhancer of
paralyzing agents. Enflurane has been found to
increase intracranial pressure and the risk of seizures;
therefore, its use is contraindicated in patients with
seizure disorders.
Isoflurane (Forane) is not toxic to the liver but can
cause some cardiac irregularities. Isofluorane is often
used in combination with intravenous anesthetics for
anesthesia induction. Awakening from anesthesia is
faster than it is with halothane and enfluorane.
Desfluorane (Suprane) may increase the heart rate
and should not be used in patients with aortic valve
stenosis; however, it does not usually cause heart
arrhythmias. Desflurane may cause coughing and excitation during induction and is therefore used with
intravenous anesthetics for induction. Desflurane is

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

rapidly eliminated and awakening is therefore faster
than with other inhaled agents.


Sevofluorane (Ultane) may also cause increased
heart rate and should not be used in patients with
narrowed aortic valve (stenosis); however, it does
not usually cause heart arrhythmias. Unlike desfluorane, sevofluorane does not cause any coughing
or other related side effects, and can therefore be
used without intravenous agents for rapid induction. For this reason, sevofluorane is replacing
halothane for induction in pediatric patients. Like
desfluorane, this agent is rapidly eliminated and
allows rapid awakening.



Nitrous oxide (laughing gas) is a weak anesthetic and
is used with other agents, such as thiopental, to
produce surgical anesthesia. It has the fastest induction and recovery and is the safest because it does not
slow breathing or blood flow to the brain. However,
it diffuses rapidly into air-containing cavities and can
result in a collapsed lung (pneumothorax) or lower
the oxygen contents of tissues (hypoxia).

Commonly administered intravenous anesthetic
agents include ketamine, thiopental, opioids, and
propofol.


Ketamine (Ketalar) affects the senses, and produces
a dissociative anesthesia (catatonia, amnesia, analgesia) in which the patient may appear awake and
reactive, but cannot respond to sensory stimuli.
These properties make it especially useful for use in
developing countries and during warfare medical
treatment. Ketamine is frequently used in pediatric
patients because anesthesia and analgesia can be
achieved with an intramuscular injection. It is also
used in high-risk geriatric patients and in shock cases,
because it also provides cardiac stimulation.



Thiopental (Pentothal) is a barbiturate that induces
a rapid hypnotic state of short duration. Because
thiopental is slowly metabolized by the liver, toxic
accumulation can occur; therefore, it should not be
continuously infused. Side effects include nausea and
vomiting upon awakening.



Opioids include fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil,
and are frequently used prior to anesthesia and surgery as a sedative and analgesic, as well as a continuous infusion for primary anesthesia. Because opioids
rarely affect the cardiovascular system, they are particularly useful for cardiac surgery and other highrisk cases. Opioids act directly on spinal cord receptors, and are freqently used in epidurals for spinal
anesthesia. Side effects may include nausea and
vomiting, itching, and respiratory depression.
199

Anesthesia, general

not bind to any receptor on the cell surface and does
not seem to affect the release of chemicals that transmit nerve impulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve
cells. It is known, however, that when the sodium
molecules do not get into the neurons, nerve impulses
are not generated and the brain becomes unconscious,
does not store memories, does not register pain
impulses from other areas of the body, and does not
control involuntary reflexes. Although anesthesia may
feel like deep sleep, it is not the same. In sleep, some parts
of the brain speed up while others slow down. Under
anesthesia, the loss of consciousness is more widespread.

Anesthesia, general



Propofol (Diprivan) is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic
agent and the most recently developed intravenous
anesthetic. Its rapid induction and short duration of
action are identical to thiopental, but recovery
occurs more quickly and with much less nausea and
vomiting. Also, propofol is rapidly metabolized in
the liver and excreted in the urine, so it can be used
for long durations of anesthesia, unlike thiopental.
Hence, propofol is rapidly replacing thiopental as an
intravenous induction agent. It is used for general
surgery, cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, and pediatric
surgery.

General anesthetics are given only by anesthesiologists, the medical professionals trained to use them.
These specialists consider many factors, including a
patient’s age, weight, medication allergies, medical
history, and general health, when deciding which anesthetic or combination of anesthetics to use. General
anesthetics are usually inhaled through a mask or a
breathing tube or injected into a vein, but are also
sometimes given rectally.
General anesthesia is much safer today than it was in
the past. This progress is due to faster-acting anesthetics,
improved safety standards in the equipment used to
deliver the drugs, and better devices to monitor breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and brain activity during
surgery. Unpleasant side effects are also less common.

Recommended dosage
The dosage depends on the type of anesthetic, the
patient’s age and physical condition, the type of surgery
or medical procedure being done, and other medication
the patient takes before, during, or after surgery.

Precautions
Although the risks of serious complications from
general anesthesia are very low, they can include heart
attack, stroke, brain damage, and death. Anyone
scheduled to undergo general anesthesia should thoroughly discuss the benefits and risks with a physician.
The risks of complications depend, in part, on a
patient’s age, sex, weight, allergies, general health,
and history of smoking, drinking alcohol, or drug
use. Some of these risks can be minimized by ensuring
that the physician and anesthesiologist are fully
informed of the detailed health condition of the
patient, including any drugs that he or she may be
using. Older people are especially sensitive to the
effects of certain anesthetics and may be more likely
to experience side effects from these drugs.
Patients who have had general anesthesia should
not drink alcoholic beverages or take medication that
200

slow down the central nervous system (such as antihistamines, sedatives, tranquilizers, sleep aids, certain pain
relievers, muscle relaxants, and anti-seizure medication) for at least 24 hours, except under a doctor’s care.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions are at greater
risk of developing problems with anesthetics. Before
undergoing general anesthesia, anyone with the following conditions should absolutely inform their doctor.
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had allergic or other
unusual reactions to barbiturates or general anesthetics
in the past should notify the doctor before having general anesthesia. In particular, people who have had
malignant hyperthermia or whose family members
have had malignant hyperthermia during or after
being given an anesthetic should inform the physician.
Signs of malignant hyperthermia include rapid, irregular heartbeat, breathing problems, very high fever, and
muscle tightness or spasms. These symptoms can occur
following the administration of general anesthesia
using inhaled agents, especially halothane. In addition,
the doctor should also be told about any allergies to
foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY. The effects of anesthetics on pregnant women and fetuses vary, depending on the type
of drug. In general, giving large amounts of general
anesthetics to the mother during labor and delivery
may make the baby sluggish after delivery. Pregnant
women should discuss the use of anesthetics during
labor and delivery with their doctors. Pregnant women
who may be given general anesthesia for other medical
procedures should ensure that the treating physician is
informed about the pregnancy.
BREASTFEEDING. Some general anesthetics pass
into breast milk, but they have not been reported to
cause problems in nursing babies whose mothers were
given the drugs.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before being given
a general anesthetic, a patient who has any of the
following conditions should inform his or her doctor:
 neurological conditions, such as epilepsy or stroke


problems with the stomach or esophagus, such as
ulcers or heartburn



eating disorders



loose teeth, dentures, bridgework



heart disease or family history of heart problems



lung diseases, such as emphysema or asthma



history of smoking



immune system diseases
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

arthritis or any other conditions that affect
movement



diseases of the endocrine system, such as diabetes or
thyroid problems

Side effects
Because general anesthetics affect the central nervous system, patients may feel drowsy, weak, or tired
for as long as a few days after having general anesthesia. Fuzzy thinking, blurred vision, and coordination
problems are also possible. For these reasons, anyone
who has had general anesthesia should not drive,
operate machinery, or perform other activities that
could endanger themselves or others for at least 24
hours, or longer if necessary.
Most side effects usually disappear as the anesthetic wears off. A nurse or doctor should be notified if
these or other side effects persist or cause problems,
such as:

Interactions
General anesthetics may interact with other medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of
the drugs may be altered or the risk of side effects may
be greater. Anyone scheduled to undergo general
anesthesia should inform the doctor about all other
medication that he or she is taking. This includes prescription drugs, nonprescription medicines, and street
drugs. Serious and possibly life-threatening reactions
may occur when general anesthetics are given to people who use street drugs, such as cocaine, marijuana,
phencyclidine (PCP or angel dust), amphetamines
(uppers), barbiturates (downers), heroin, or other narcotics. Anyone who uses these drugs should make sure
their doctor or dentist knows what they have taken.

I Anesthesia, local
Definition
Local or regional anesthesia involves the injection
or application of an anesthetic drug to a specific area
of the body, as opposed to the entire body and brain as
occurs during general anesthesia.

Purpose
Local anesthetics are used to prevent patients
from feeling pain during medical, surgical, or dental
procedures. Over-the-counter local anesthetics are
also available to provide temporary relief from pain,
irritation, and itching caused by various conditions,
201

Anesthesia, local

KEY TERMS
Canker sore—A painful sore inside the mouth.
Cold sore—A small blister on the lips or face,
caused by a virus. Also called a fever blister.
Epidural space—The space surrounding the spinal
fluid sac.
Malignant hyperthermia—A type of reaction
(probably with a genetic basis) that can occur during general anesthesia in which the patient experiences a high fever, the muscles become rigid, and
the heart rate and blood pressure fluctuate.
Subarachnoid space—The space surrounding the
spinal cord that is filled with cerebrospinal fluid.

into four groups: injectable, topical, dental (noninjectable), and ophthalmic.
Local and regional anesthesia work by altering the
flow of sodium molecules into nerve cells or neurons
through the cell membrane. Exactly how the anesthetic does this is not understood, since the drug
apparently does not bind to any receptor on the cell
surface and does not seem to affect the release of
chemicals that transmit nerve impulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells. It is known, however,
that when the sodium molecules do not get into the
neurons, nerve impulses are not generated and pain
impulses are not transmitted to the brain. The duration of action of an anesthetic depends on the type and
amount of anesthetic administered.

Topical—Not ingested; applied to the outside of
the body, for example to the skin, eye, or mouth.

Regional anesthesia
Types of regional anesthesia include:


Spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia involves the
injection of a small amount of local anesthetic
directly into the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the
spinal cord (the subarachnoid space). Blood pressure
drops are common but are easily treated.



Epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia involves
the injection of a large volume of local anesthetic
directly into the space surrounding the spinal fluid
sac (the epidural space), not into the spinal fluid.
Pain relief occurs more slowly but is less likely to
produce blood pressure drops. Also, the block can be
maintained for long periods, even days.



Surgeries involving the chest and abdomen are
usually performed under general anesthesia.

Nerve blocks. Nerve blocks involve the injection of
an anesthetic into the area around a nerve that supplies a particular region of the body, preventing the
nerve from carrying nerve impulses to the brain.

Local and regional anesthesia have advantages
over general anesthesia in that patients can avoid
some unpleasant side effects, can receive longer lasting
pain relief, have reduced blood loss, and maintain a
sense of psychological comfort by not losing
consciousness.

Anesthetics may be administered with another
drug, such as epinephrine (adrenaline), which decreases
bleeding, and sodium bicarbonate to decrease the acidity of a drug so that it will work faster. In addition,
drugs may be administered to help a patient remain
calm and more comfortable or to make them sleepy.

such as cold sores, canker sores, sore throats, sunburn,
insect bites, poison ivy, and minor cuts and scratches.
Types of surgery or medical procedures that regularly make use of local or regional anesthesia include
the following:


biopsies in which skin or tissue samples are taken for
diagnostic procedures



childbirth



surgeries on the arms, hands, legs, or feet



eye surgery



surgeries involving the urinary tract or sexual organs

Description
Regional anesthesia typically affects a larger area
than local anesthesia, for example, everything below
the waist. As a result, regional anesthesia may be used
for more involved or complicated surgical or medical
procedures. Regional anesthetics are injected. Local
anesthesia involves the injection into the skin or muscle or application to the skin of an anesthetic directly
where pain will occur. Local anesthesia can be divided
202

Local anesthesia
INJECTABLE LOCAL ANESTHETICS. These medicines
are given by injection to numb and provide pain relief
to some part of the body during surgery, dental procedures, or other medical procedures. They are given
only by a trained health care professional and only in a
doctor’s office or a hospital. Some commonly used
injectable local anesthetics are procaine (Novocain),
lidocaine (Dalcaine, Dilocaine, L-Caine, Nervocaine,

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

other

brands),

and

tetracaine

told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives,
or other substances.

TOPICAL ANESTHETICS. Topical anesthetics, such
as benzocaine, lidocaine, dibucaine, pramoxine,
butamben, and tetracaine, relieve pain and itching by
deadening the nerve endings in the skin. They are
ingredients in a variety of nonprescription products
that are applied to the skin to relieve the discomfort of
sunburn, insect bites or stings, poison ivy, and minor
cuts, scratches, and burns. These products are sold as
creams, ointments, sprays, lotions, and gels.

Older people may be more sensitive to the effects
of local anesthetics, especially lidocaine. This
increased sensitivity may increase the risk of side
effects. Older people who use nonprescription local
anesthetics should be especially careful not to use
more than the recommended amount. Children also
may be especially sensitive to the effects of some local
anesthetics, which may increase the chance of side
effects. Anyone using these medicines on a child
should be careful not to use more than the amount
that is recommended for children. Certain types of
local anesthetics should not be used at all young children. Follow package directions carefully and check
with a doctor of pharmacist if there are any questions.

DENTAL ANESTHETICS (NON-INJECTABLE). Some
local anesthetics are intended for pain relief in the
mouth or throat. They may be used to relieve throat
pain, teething pain, painful canker sores, toothaches,
or discomfort from dentures, braces, or bridgework.
Some dental anesthetics are available only with a doctor’s prescription. Others may be purchased without a
prescription, including products such as Num-Zit,
Orajel, Chloraseptic lozenges, and Xylocaine.
OPHTHALMIC ANESTHETICS. Other local anesthetics are designed for use in the eye. The ophthalmic
anesthetics proparacaine and tetracaine are used to
numb the eye before certain eye examinations. Eye
doctors may also use these medicines before measuring eye pressure or removing stitches or foreign objects
from the eye. These drugs are to be given only by a
trained health care professional.

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
local anesthetic and the purpose for which it is being
used. When using a nonprescription local anesthetic,
follow the directions on the package. Questions concerning how to use a product should be referred to a
medical doctor, dentist, or pharmacist.

Precautions
People who strongly feel that they cannot psychologically cope with being awake and alert during certain procedures may not be good candidates for local
or regional anesthesia. Other medications may be
given in conjunction with the anesthetic, however, to
relieve anxiety and help the patient relax.
Local anesthetics should be used only for the conditions for which they are intended. For example, a
topical anesthetic meant to relieve sunburn pain
should not be used on cold sores. Anyone who has
had an unusual reaction to any local anesthetic in the
past should check with a doctor before using any type
of local anesthetic again. The doctor should also be
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Regional anesthetics
Serious, possibly life-threatening, side effects may
occur when anesthetics are given to people who use
street drugs. Anyone who uses cocaine, marijuana,
amphetamines, barbiturates, phencyclidine (PCP, or
angel dust), heroin, or other street drugs should
make sure their doctor or dentist knows what they
have used.
Patients who have had a particular kind of reaction called malignant hyperthermia (or who have one
or more family members who have had this problem)
during or just after receiving a general anesthetic
should inform their doctors before receiving any kind
of anesthetic. Signs of malignant hyperthermia include
fast and irregular heartbeat, very high fever, breathing
problems, and muscle spasms or tightness.
Although problems are rare, some unwanted side
effects may occur when regional anesthetics are used
during labor and delivery. These anesthetics can prolong labor and increase the risk of Cesarean section.
Pregnant women should discuss with their doctors the
risks and benefits of being given these drugs.
Patients should not drive or operate other
machinery immediately following a procedure involving regional anesthesia, due to numbness and weakness, or if local anesthesia also included drugs to make
the patient sleep or strong pain medications. Injection
sites should be kept clean, dry, and uncovered to prevent infection.
Injectable local anesthetics
Until the anesthetic wears off, patients should be
careful not to injure the numbed area. If the anesthetic

was used in the mouth, do not eat or chew gum until
feeling returns.
Topical anesthetics
Unless advised by a doctor, topical anesthetics
should not be used on or near any part of the body
with large sores, broken or scraped skin, severe injury,
or infection. They should also not be used on large
areas of skin. Some topical anesthetics contain alcohol
and should not be used near an open flame, or while
smoking.
Anyone using a topical anesthetic should be careful not to get this medication in the eyes, nose, or
mouth. When using a spray form of this medication,
do not spray it directly on the face, but apply it to the
face with a cotton swab or sterile gauze pad. After
using a topical anesthetic on a child, make sure the
child does not get the medicine in his or her mouth.
Topical anesthetics are intended for the temporary relief of pain and itching. They should not be used
for more than a few days at a time. Check with a
doctor if:


the discomfort continues for more than seven days



the problem gets worse



the treated area becomes infected



new signs of irritation, such as skin rash, burning,
stinging, or swelling appear
Dental anesthetics (non-injectable)

Dental anesthetics should not be used if certain
kinds of infections are present. Check package directions or check with a dentist or medical doctor if
uncertain. Dental anesthetics should be used only for
temporary pain relief. If problems such as toothache,
mouth sores, or pain from dentures or braces continue, check with a dentist. Check with a doctor if
sore throat pain is severe, lasts more than two days,
or is accompanied by other symptoms such as fever,
headache, skin rash, swelling, nausea, or vomiting.
Patients should not eat or chew gum while the
mouth is numb from a dental anesthetic. There is a
risk of accidently biting the tongue or the inside of the
mouth. Also nothing should be eaten or drunk for one
hour after applying a dental anesthetic to the back of
the mouth or throat, since the medicine may interfere
with swallowing and may cause choking. If normal
feeling does not return to the mouth within a few
hours after receiving a dental anesthetic or if it is
difficult to open the mouth, check with a dentist.
204

Ophthalmic anesthetics
When anesthetics are used in the eye, it is important not to rub or wipe the eye until the effect of the
anesthetic has worn off and feeling has returned.
Rubbing the eye while it is numb could cause injury.

Side effects
Side effects of regional or local anesthetics vary
depending on the type of anesthetic used and the way it
is administered. Anyone who has unusual symptoms
following the use of an anesthetic should get in touch
with his or her doctor immediately.
There is a small risk of developing a severe headache called a spinal headache following a spinal or
epidural block. This headache is severe when the
patient is upright and hardly felt when the patient
lies down. Though rare, it can occur and can be
treated by performing a blood patch, in which a
small amount of the patient’s own blood is injected
into the area in the back where the anesthetic was
injected. The blood clots and closes up any area that
may have been leaking spinal fluid. Relief is almost
immediate. Finally, blood clots or abscess can form in
the back, but these are also readily treatable and so
pose little risk.
A physician should be notified immediately if any
of these symptoms occur:


large swellings that look like hives on the skin, in the
mouth, or in the throat



severe headache



blurred or double vision



dizziness or lightheadedness

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Some anesthetic drugs may interact with other
medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or
both of the drugs may change or the risk of side effects
may be greater. Anyone who receives a regional or
local anesthetic should let the doctor know all other
drugs he or she is taking including prescription drugs,
nonprescription drugs, and street drugs (such as
cocaine, marijuana, and heroin).

I Aneurysmectomy
Definition
Aneurysmectomy is a surgical procedure performed to repair a weak area in the aorta. The aorta
is the largest artery in the body and the main blood
vessel leading away from the heart.

Purpose
The purpose of aneurysmectomy is to repair an
aortic aneurysm that is likely to rupture if left in place.
Aneurysmectomy is indicated for an aortic aneurysm
that grows to at least 2 in(5 cm) or for an aortic
aneurysm of any size that is symptomatic, tender, or
enlarging rapidly.

Precautions
Aneurysmectomy may not be appropriate for
patients with severely debilitating diseases such as
cancer, emphysema, and heart failure.

Description
An aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of the
aorta that is usually due to arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis. People who are 50-80 years old are most
likely to develop an aortic aneurysm, with men four
times more likely to develop one than women.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS
Aneurysm—A weakening in the muscular walls of
a part of the artery which causes the damaged
section to enlarge or sag, giving it a balloon-like
appearance.
Aorta—The main blood vessel that leads away
from the heart and the body’s largest artery. The
aorta carries blood from the heart through the chest
and abdomen, providing major branches to all of
the organs in the body.
Arteriosclerosis—Hardening of the arteries that
occurs as part of the aging process.
Artery—A blood vessel that carries blood from the
heart to the body’s tissues.
Atherosclerosis—A form of arteriosclerosis in
which cholesterol-containing fatty deposits accumulate in the inner most walls of the heart’s
arteries.
Thoracic—Relating to the chest.

An aortic aneurysm develops and grows slowly. It
rarely produces symptoms and is usually only diagnosed by accident during a routine physical exam or
on an x ray or ultrasound done for another reason. As
the aneurysm grows larger, the risk of bursting with no
warning, which causes catastrophic bleeding, rises. A
ruptured aortic aneurysm can cause sudden loss of a
fatal amount of blood within minutes or it can leak in
a series of small bleeds that lead within hours or days
to massive bleeding. A leaking aortic aneurysm that is
not treated is always fatal.
Aneurysmectomy is performed to repair the two
most common types of aortic aneurysms: abdominal
aortic aneurysms that occur in the abdomen below
the kidneys, and thoracic aortic aneurysms that occur
in the chest. It is major surgery performed in a hospital
under general anesthesia and involves removing debris
and then implanting a flexible tube (graft) to replace the
enlarged artery. Aneurysmectomy for an aneurysm of
the ascending aorta (the first part of the aorta that travels
upward from the heart) requires the use of a heart-lung
machine that temporarily stops the heart while the
aneurysm is repaired. Aneurysmectomy requires a
one-week hospital stay; the recovery period is five weeks.
During surgery, the site of the aneurysm (either
the abdomen or the chest) is opened with an incision to
expose the aneurysm. The aorta is clamped above and
below the aneurysm to stop the flow of blood. Then,
205

Aneurysmectomy

Interactions

Angina

an incision is made in the aneurysm. An artificial
Dacron tube is sewn in place above and below the
opened aneurysm, but the aneurysm is not removed.
Plaque or clotted blood are cleaned from the diseased
tissue. The clamps are removed and blood flow is reestablished through the graft. The wall of the aneurysm is wrapped around the graft to protect it and the
skin of the abdomen or chest is sewn up.
Aneurysmectomy can be performed as elective or
emergency surgery. Elective aneurysmectomy takes
about an hour and is far safer than emergency aneurysmectomy, with a mortality rate of 3-5% for elective
abdominal aneurysmectomy and 5-10% for elective
thoracic aneurysmectomy. When an aneurysm
ruptures, 62% of patients die before they reach the
hospital. Of those who make it into emergency aneurysmectromy, 50% die. After a successful aneurysmectomy, the patient has nearly the same life expectancy as
other people of the same age.

Preparation
Before elective aneurysmectomy, blood studies, a
chest x ray, cardiac catherization, electrocardiogram
(ECG), and ultrasound are performed.

Aftercare

I Angina
Definition
Angina is pain, ‘‘discomfort,’’ or pressure localized in the chest that is caused by an insufficient
supply of blood (ischemia) to the heart muscle. It is
also sometimes characterized by a feeling of choking,
suffocation, or crushing heaviness. This condition is
also called angina pectoris.

Description
Often described as a muscle spasm and choking
sensation, the term ‘‘angina’’ is used primarily to
describe chest (thoracic) pain originating from insufficient oxygen to the heart muscle. An episode of angina
is not an actual heart attack, but rather pain that results
from the heart muscle temporarily receiving too little
blood. This temporary condition may be the result of
demanding activities such as exercise and does not
necessarily indicate that the heart muscle is experiencing permanent damage. In fact, episodes of angina
seldom cause permanent damage to heart muscle.
Angina can be subdivided further into two categories: angina of effort and variant angina.
Angina of effort

After aneurysmectomy, the patient is monitored
in an Intensive Care Unit for the first 24–48 hours.
Follow-up tests include ECG, chest x ray, and
ultrasound.

Risks
Elective aneurysmectomy has a 5-10% rate of
complications, such as bleeding, kidney failure,
respiratory complications, heart attack, stroke, infection, limb loss, bowel ischemia, and impotence. These
complications are many times more common in emergency aneurysmectomy.

Angina of effort is a common disorder caused by
the narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) that
supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle. In the
case of angina of effort, the heart (coronary) arteries
can provide the heart muscle (myocardium) adequate
blood during rest but not during periods of exercise,
stress, or excitement–any of which may precipitate
pain. The pain is relieved by resting or by administering nitroglycerin, a medication that reduces ischemia
of the heart. Patients with angina of effort have an
increased risk of heart attack (myocardial infarction).
Variant angina

Variant angina is uncommon and occurs independently of atherosclerosis which may, however, be present as an incidental finding. Variant angina occurs at
rest and is not related to excessive work by the heart
muscle. Research indicates that variant angina is
caused by coronary artery muscle spasm of insufficient
duration or intensity to cause an actual heart attack.

Ischemia —Decreased blood supply to an organ or

bone (sternum). It occasionally is experienced in the
shoulder, arm, neck, or jaw regions. Because episodes
of angina occur when the heart’s need for oxygen
increases beyond the oxygen available from the
blood nourishing the heart, the condition is often precipitated by physical exertion. In most cases, the symptoms are relieved within a few minutes by resting or by
taking prescribed angina medications. Emotional
stress, extreme temperatures, heavy meals, cigarette
smoking, and alcohol can also cause or contribute to
an episode of angina.

Diagnosis
Physicians can usually diagnose angina based on
the patient’s symptoms and the precipitating factors.
However, other diagnostic testing is often required to
confirm or rule out angina, or to determine the severity of the underlying heart disease.
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
An electrocardiogram is a test that records electrical impulses from the heart. The resulting graph of
electrical activity can show if the heart muscle isn’t
functioning properly as a result of a lack of oxygen.
Electrocardiograms are also useful in investigating
other possible abnormal features of the heart.
Stress test
For many individuals with angina, the results of
an electrocardiogram while at rest will not show any
abnormalities. Because the symptoms of angina occur
during stress, the functioning of the heart may need to
be evaluated under the physical stress of exercise. The
stress test records information from the electrocardiogram before, during, and after exercise in search of
stress-related abnormalities. Blood pressure is also
measured during the stress test and symptoms are
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

noted. A more involved and complex stress test (for
example, thallium scanning) may be used in some
cases to picture the blood flow in the heart muscle
during the most intense time of exercise and after rest.
Angiogram
The angiogram, which is basically an x ray of the
coronary artery, has been noted to be the most accurate diagnostic test to indicate the presence and extent
of coronary disease. In this procedure, a long, thin,
flexible tube (catheter) is maneuvered into an artery
located in the forearm or groin. This catheter is passed
further through the artery into one of the two major
coronary arteries. A dye is injected at that time to help
the x rays ‘‘see’’ the heart and arteries more clearly.
Many brief x rays are made to create a ‘‘movie’’ of
blood flowing through the coronary arteries, which
will reveal any possible narrowing that causes a
decrease in blood flow to the heart muscle and associated symptoms of angina.

Treatment
Conservative treatment
Artery disease causing angina is addressed initially by controlling existing factors placing the individual at risk. These risk factors include cigarette
smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels,
and obesity. Angina is often controlled by medication,
most commonly with nitroglycerin. This drug relieves
symptoms of angina by increasing the diameter of the
blood vessels carrying blood to the heart muscle.
Nitroglycerin is taken whenever discomfort occurs or
is expected. It may be taken by mouth by placing the
tablet under the tongue or transdermally by placing a
medicated patch directly on the skin. In addition, beta
blockers or calcium channel blockers may be prescribed
to also decrease the demand on the heart by decreasing
the rate and workload of the heart.
Surgical treatment
When conservative treatments are not effective in
the reduction of angina pain and the risk of heart
attack remains high, physicians may recommend
angioplasty or surgery. Coronary artery bypass surgery is an operation in which a blood vessel (often a
long vein surgically removed from the leg) is grafted
onto the blocked artery to bypass the blocked portion.
This newly formed pathway allows blood to flow adequately to the heart muscle.
Another procedure used to improve blood flow to
the heart is balloon angioplasty. In this procedure, the

physician inserts a catheter with a tiny balloon at the
end into a forearm or groin artery. The catheter is then
threaded up into the coronary arteries and the balloon
is inflated to open the vessel in narrowed sections.
Other techniques using laser and mechanical devices
are being developed and applied, also by means of
catheters.

Alternative treatment
During an angina episode, relief has been noted by
applying massage or kinesiological methods, but these
techniques are not standard recommendations by physicians. For example, one technique places the palm
and fingers of either hand on the forehead while simultaneously firmly massaging the sternum (breast bone)
up and down its entire length using the other hand.
This is followed by additional massaging by the fingertip and thumb next to the sternum, on each side.
Once the angina has subsided, the cause should be
determined and treated. Atherosclerosis, a major associated cause, requires diet and lifestyle adjustments,
primarily including regular exercise, reduction of dietary sugar and saturated fats, and increase of dietary
fiber. Both conventional and alternative medicine
agree that increasing exercise and improving diet are
important steps to reduce high cholesterol levels.
Alternative medicine has proposed specific cholesterol-lowering treatments, with several gaining the
attention and interest of the public. One of the most
recent popular treatments is garlic (Allium sativum).
Some studies have shown that adequate dosages of
garlic can reduce total cholesterol by about 10%,
LDL (bad) cholesterol by 15%, and raise HDL
(good) cholesterol by 10%. Other studies have not
shown significant benefit. Although its effect on cholesterol is not as great as that achieved by medications,
garlic may possibly be of benefit in relatively mild
cases of high cholesterol, without causing the side
effects associated with cholesterol-reducing drugs.
Other herbal remedies that may help lower cholesterol
include alfalfa (Medicago sativa), fenugreek
(Trigonella foenum-graecum), Asian ginseng (Panax
ginseng), and tumeric (Curcuma longa).
Antioxidants, including vitamin A (beta carotene),
vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium, can limit the oxidative damage to the walls of blood vessels that may
be a precursor of atherosclerotic plaque formation.

Prognosis
The prognosis for a patient with angina depends
on its origin, type, severity, and the general health of
208

the individual. A person who has angina has the best
prognosis if he or she seeks prompt medical attention
and learns the pattern of his or her angina, such as
what causes the attacks, what they feel like, how long
episodes usually last, and whether medication relieves
the attacks. If patterns of the symptoms change significantly, or if symptoms resemble those of a heart
attack, medical help should be sought immediately.

Prevention
In most cases, the best prevention involves changing one’s habits to avoid bringing on attacks of
angina. If blood pressure medication has been prescribed, compliance is a necessity and should be a
priority as well. Many healthcare professionals–
including physicians, dietitians, and nurses–can provide valuable advice on proper diet, weight control,
blood cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. These
professionals also offer suggestions about current
treatments and information to help stop smoking. In
general, the majority of those with angina adjust their
lives to minimize episodes of angina, by taking necessary precautions and using medications if recommended and necessary. Coronary artery disease is the
underlying problem that should be addressed.

I Angiography
Definition
Angiography is the x-ray study of the blood
vessels. An angiogram uses a radiopaque substance,
or dye, to make the blood vessels visible under x ray.
Arteriography is a type of angiography that involves
the study of the arteries.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Angiography is used to detect abnormalities or
blockages in the blood vessels (called occlusions)
throughout the circulatory system and in some organs.
The procedure is commonly used to identify atherosclerosis; to diagnose heart disease; to evaluate kidney function
and detect kidney cysts or tumors; to detect an aneurysm
(an abnormal bulge of an artery that can rupture leading
to hemorrhage), tumor, blood clot, or arteriovenous malformations (abnormals tangles of arteries and veins) in
the brain; and to diagnose problems with the retina of the
eye. It is also used to give surgeons an accurate ‘‘map’’ of
the heart prior to open-heart surgery, or of the brain prior
to neurosurgery.

risks of ionizing radiation exposure to the fetus, pregnant women are also advised to avoid this procedure.

Description
Angiography is usually performed at a hospital by
a trained radiologist and assisting technician or nurse.
It takes place in an x-ray or fluoroscopy suite, and for
most types of angiograms, the patient’s vital signs will
be monitored throughout the procedure.
Angiography requires the injection of a contrast dye
that makes the blood vessels visible to x ray. The dye is
injected through a procedure known as arterial puncture.
The puncture is usually made in the groin area, armpit,
inside elbow, or neck. The site is cleaned with an antiseptic agent and injected with a local anesthetic. First, a
small incision is made in the skin to help the needle pass.
A needle containing an inner wire called a stylet is
inserted through the skin into the artery. When the radiologist has punctured the artery with the needle, the
stylet is removed and replaced with another long wire
called a guide wire. It is normal for blood to spout out of
the needle before the guide wire is inserted.
The guide wire is fed through the outer needle into
the artery and to the area that requires angiographic
study. A fluoroscopic screen that displays a view of the
patient’s vascular system is used to pilot the wire to the
correct location. Once it is in position, the needle is
removed and a catheter is slid over the length of the
guide wire until it to reaches the area of study. The
guide wire is removed and the catheter is left in place in
preparation for the injection of the contrast medium,
or dye.
Depending on the type of angiography procedure
being performed, the contrast medium is either injected
by hand with a syringe or is mechanically injected with
an automatic injector connected to the catheter. An
automatic injector is used frequently because it is able
to propel a large volume of dye very quickly to the
angiogram site. The patient is warned that the injection
will start, and instructed to remain very still. The injection causes some mild to moderate discomfort. Possible
side effects or reactions include headache, dizziness,
irregular heartbeat, nausea, warmth, burning sensation, and chest pain, but they usually last only momentarily. To view the area of study from different angles
or perspectives, the patient may be asked to change
positions several times, and subsequent dye injections
may be administered. During any injection, the patient
or the camera may move.
Throughout the dye injection procedure, x-ray
pictures and/or fluoroscopic pictures (or moving
210

x rays) will be taken. Because of the high pressure of
arterial blood flow, the dye will dissipate through the
patient’s system quickly, so pictures must be taken in
rapid succession. An automatic film changer is used
because the manual changing of x-ray plates can eat up
valuable time.
Once the x rays are complete, the catheter is slowly
and carefully removed from the patient. Pressure is
applied to the site with a sandbag or other weight for
10-20 minutes in order for clotting to take place and
the arterial puncture to reseal itself. A pressure bandage is then applied.
Most angiograms follow the general procedures
outlined above, but vary slightly depending on the
area of the vascular system being studied. A variety
of common angiography procedures are outlined
below:
Cerebral angiography
Cerebral angiography is used to detect aneurysms,
blood clots, and other vascular irregularities in the
brain. The catheter is inserted into the femoral or
carotid artery and the injected contrast medium travels through the blood vessels on the brain. Patients
frequently experience headache, warmth, or a burning
sensation in the head or neck during the injection
portion of the procedure. A cerebral angiogram
takes two to four hours to complete.
Coronary angiography
Coronary angiography is administered by a cardiologist with training in radiology or, occasionally,
by a radiologist. The arterial puncture is typically
given in the femoral artery, and the cardiologist uses
a guide wire and catheter to perform a contrast injection and x-ray series on the coronary arteries. The
catheter may also be placed in the left ventricle to
examine the mitral and aortic valves of the heart. If
the cardiologist requires a view of the right ventricle of
the heart or of the tricuspid or pulmonic valves, the
catheter will be inserted through a large vein and
guided into the right ventricle. The catheter also serves
the purpose of monitoring blood pressures in these
different locations inside the heart. The angiogram
procedure takes several hours, depending on the complexity of the procedure.
Pulmonary angiography
Pulmonary, or lung, angiography is performed to
evaluate blood circulation to the lungs. It is also considered the most accurate diagnostic test for detecting
a pulmonary embolism. The procedure differs from
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Kidney angiography
Patients with chronic renal disease or injury can
suffer further damage to their kidneys from the contrast medium used in a kidney angiogram, yet they
often require the test to evaluate kidney function.
These patients should be well-hydrated with a intravenous saline drip before the procedure, and may benefit
from available medications (e.g., dopamine) that help
to protect the kidney from further injury due to contrast agents. During a kidney angiogram, the guide
wire and catheter are inserted into the femoral artery
in the groin area and advanced through the abdominal
aorta, the main artery in the abdomen, and into the
renal arteries. The procedure will take approximately
one hour.
Fluorescein angiography
Fluorescein angiography is used to diagnose retinal problems and circulatory disorders. It is typically
conducted as an outpatient procedure. The patient’s
pupils are dilated with eye drops and he rests his chin
and forehead against a bracing apparatus to keep it
still. Sodium fluorescein dye is then injected with a
syringe into a vein in the patient’s arm. The dye will
travel through the patient’s body and into the blood
vessels of the eye. The procedure does not require
x rays. Instead, a rapid series of close-up photographs
of the patient’s eyes are taken, one set immediately
after the dye is injected, and a second set approximately 20 minutes later once the dye has moved
through the patient’s vascular system. The entire
procedure takes up to one hour.
Celiac and mesenteric angiography
Celiac and mesenteric angiography involves x-ray
exploration of the celiac and mesenteric arteries, arterial branches of the abdominal aorta that supply blood
to the abdomen and digestive system. The test is commonly used to detect aneurysm, thrombosis, and signs
of ischemia in the celiac and mesenteric arteries, and to
locate the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is also
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions,
including portal hypertension, and cirrhosis. The procedure can take up to three hours, depending on the
number of blood vessels studied.
Splenoportography
A splenoportograph is a variation of an angiogram that involves the injection of contrast medium
directly into the spleen to view the splenic and portal
veins. It is used to diagnose blockages in the splenic
vein and portal vein thrombosis and to assess the
strength and location of the vascular system prior to
liver transplantation.
Most angiography procedures are typically paid
for by major medical insurance. Patients should check
with their individual insurance plans to determine
their coverage.

Preparation
Patients undergoing an angiogram are advised to
stop eating and drinking eight hours prior to the procedure. They must remove all jewelry before the procedure and change into a hospital gown. If the arterial
puncture is to be made in the armpit or groin area,
shaving may be required. A sedative may be administered to relax the patient for the procedure. An IV line
will also be inserted into a vein in the patient’s arm
before the procedure begins in case medication or
blood products are required during the angiogram.
Prior to the angiography procedure, patients will
be briefed on the details of the test, the benefits and
risks, and the possible complications involved, and
asked to sign an informed consent form.

Aftercare
Because life-threatening internal bleeding is a possible complication of an arterial puncture, an overnight stay in the hospital is sometimes recommended
following an angiography procedure, particularly with
cerebral and coronary angiograms. If the procedure is
performed on an outpatient basis, the patient is typically kept under close observation for a period of at six
to 12 hours before being released. If the arterial puncture was performed in the femoral artery, the patient
will be instructed to keep his leg straight and relatively
immobile during the observation period. The patient’s
blood pressure and vital signs will be monitored and
the puncture site observed closely. Pain medication
may be prescribed if the patient is experiencing discomfort from the puncture, and a cold pack is applied
to the site to reduce swelling. It is normal for the
211

Angiography

cerebral and coronary angiograms in that the guide
wire and catheter are inserted into a vein instead of an
artery, and are guided up through the chambers of the
heart and into the pulmonary artery. Throughout the
procedure, the patient’s vital signs are monitored to
ensure that the catheter doesn’t cause arrhythmias, or
irregular heartbeats. The contrast medium is then
injected into the pulmonary artery where it circulates
through the lung capillaries. The test typically takes up
to 90 minutes.

Angioplasty

puncture site to be sore and bruised for several weeks.
The patient may also develop a hematoma, a hard
mass created by the blood vessels broken during the
procedure. Hematomas should be watched carefully,
as they may indicate continued bleeding of the arterial
puncture site.
Angiography patients are also advised to enjoy
two to three days of rest and relaxation after the
procedure in order to avoid placing any undue stress
on the arterial puncture. Patients who experience continued bleeding or abnormal swelling of the puncture
site, sudden dizziness, or chest pains in the days following an angiography procedure should seek medical
attention immediately.
Patients undergoing a fluorescein angiography
should not drive or expose their eyes to direct sunlight
for 12 hours following the procedure.

Risks
Because angiography involves puncturing an
artery, internal bleeding or hemorrhage are possible
complications of the test. As with any invasive procedure, infection of the puncture site or bloodstream is
also a risk, but this is rare.
A stroke or heart attack may be triggered by an
angiogram if blood clots or plaque on the inside of the
arterial wall are dislodged by the catheter and form a
blockage in the blood vessels or artery. The heart may
also become irritated by the movement of the catheter
through its chambers during pulmonary and coronary
angiography procedures, and arrhythmias may develop.
Patients who develop an allergic reaction to the
contrast medium used in angiography may experience
a variety of symptoms, including swelling, difficulty
breathing, heart failure, or a sudden drop in blood
pressure. If the patient is aware of the allergy before
the test is administered, certain medications can be
administered at that time to counteract the reaction.
Angiography involves minor exposure to radiation through the x rays and fluoroscopic guidance
used in the procedure. Unless the patient is pregnant,
or multiple radiological or fluoroscopic studies are
required, the small dose of radiation incurred during
a single procedure poses little risk. However, multiple
studies requiring fluoroscopic exposure that are conducted in a short time period have been known to
cause skin necrosis in some individuals. This risk can
be minimized by careful monitoring and documentation of cumulative radiation doses administered to
these patients.

212

Normal results
The results of an angiogram or arteriogram
depend on the artery or organ system being examined. Generally, test results should display a normal
and unimpeded flow of blood through the vascular
system. Fluorescein angiography should result in no
leakage of fluorescein dye through the retinal blood
vessels.

Abnormal results
Abnormal results of an angiography may display
a restricted blood vessel or arterial blood flow (ischemia) or an irregular placement or location of blood
vessels. The results of an angiography vary widely by
the type of procedure performed, and should be interpreted and explained to the patient by a trained
radiologist.

I Angioplasty
Definition
Angioplasty is a term describing a procedure used
to widen vessels narrowed by stenoses or occlusions.
There are various types of these procedures and their
names are associated with the type of vessel entry and
equipment used. For example, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) describes entry through
the skin (percutaneous) and navigates to the area of
the vessel of interest through the same vessel or one
that communicates with it (transluminal). In the case
of a procedure involving the coronary arteries, the
point of entry could be the femoral artery in the
groin and the catheter/guidewire system is passed
through the aorta to the heart and the origin of the
coronary arteries at the base of the aorta just outside
the aortic valve.

Plaque

In balloon angioplasty, plaque is pushed out of the clogged artery by the inflation of the balloon device. (Illustration by Argosy Inc.)

Purpose
In individuals with an occulsive vascular disease
such as atherosclerosis, blood flow is impaired to an
organ (such as the heart) or to a distal body part ( such
as the lower leg) by the narrowing of the vessel’s lumen
due to fatty deposits or calcium accumulation. This
narrowing may occur in any vessel but may occur
anywhere. Once the vessel has been widened, adequate
blood flow is returned. The vessel may narrow again
over time at the same location and the procedure could
be repeated.

KEY TERMS
plaque—In atherosclerosis, a swollen area in the
lining of an artery formed by fatty deposits.
cardiac catheterization—A procedure to pass a
catheter to the heart and its vessels for the purpose
of diagnosing coronary artery disease, assessing injury
or disease of the aorta, or evaluating cardiac function.
EKG—Electrocardiogram, used to study and record
the electrical activity of the heart.

Precautions
Angioplasty procedures are performed on hospital inpatients in facilities for proper monitoring
and recovery. If the procedure is to be performed
in a coronary artery, the patient’s care is likely to
be provided by specially trained physicians, nurses,
and vascular specialists. Typically, patients are
given anticoagulants prior to the procedure to
assist in the prevention of thromboses (blood clots).
Administration of anticoagulants, however, may
impede the sealing of the vascular entry point. The
procedure will be performed using fluoroscopic guidance and contrast media. Since the decision to perform angioplasty may have been made following a
diagnostic angiogram, the patient’s sensitivity to iodinated contrast media is likely to known. The procedure may then require the use of non-ionic contrast
agents.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Description
Angioplasty was originally performed by dilating
the vessel with the introduction of larger and larger
stiff catheters through the narrowed space.
Complications of this procedure caused researchers
to develop means of widening the vessel using a minimally sized device. Today, catheters contain balloons
that are inflated to widen the vessel and stents to
provide structural support for the vessel. Lasers may
be used to assist in the break up of the fat or calcium
plaque. Catheters may also be equipped with spinning
wires or drill tips to clean out the plaque.
Angioplasty may be performed while the patient is
sedated or anesthetized, depending on the vessels
involved. If a percutaneous transluminal coronary
angioplasty (PTCA) is to be performed, the patient
213

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors

will be kept awake to report on discomfort and cough
if required. PTCA procedures are performed in cardiac catheterization labs with sophisticated monitoring
devices. If angioplasty is performed in the radiology
department’s angiographic suite, the patient may be
sedated for the procedure and a nurse will monitor
the patient’s vital signs during the procedure. If performed by a vascular surgeon, the angioplasty procedure will be performed in an operating room or
specially designed vascular procedure suite.
The site of the introduction of the angioplasty
equipment is prepared as a sterile surgical site.
Although many procedures are performed by puncturing the vessel through skin, many procedures are also
performed by surgically exposing the site of entry.
Direct view of the vessel’s puncture site aids in monitoring damage to the vessel or excessive bleeding at
the site. Once the vessel is punctured and the guidewire
is introduced, fluoroscopy is used to monitor small
injections of contrast media used to visualize the path
through the vessel. If the fluoroscopy system has a
feature called ‘roadmap’, the amount of contrast
media injected will be greater in order to define the full
route the guidewire will take. The fluoroscopy system
will then superimpose subsequent images over the roadmap while the vessel is traversed, that is, the physician
moves the guidewire along the map to the destination.
Having reached the area of stenosis, the physician
will inflate the balloon on the catheter that has been
passed along the guidewire. Balloons are inflated in size
and duration depending on the size and location of the
vessel. In some cases, the use of a stent (a mesh of wire
that resembles a Chinese finger puzzle) may also be
used. The vessel may be widened before, during, or
after the deployment of the stent. Procedures for deploying stents are dependent on the type of stent used. In
cases where the vessel is tortuous or at intersections of
vessels, the use of a graph may be necessary to provide
structural strength to the vessel. Stents, graphs, and
balloon dilation may all be used together or separately.
The procedure is verified using fluoroscopy and
contrast media to produce an angiogram or by using
intravascular ultrasound or both. All equipment is
withdrawn from the vessel and the puncture site
repaired.

Risks
During the procedure there is a danger of puncturing the vessel with the guidewire. This is a very
small risk. Patients must be monitored for hematoma
or hemorrhage at the puncture site. There is also a
small risk of heart attack, emboli, and although
214

unlikely death. Hospitalization will vary in length by
the patient’s overall condition, any complications, and
availability of home care.

I Angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors
Definition
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (also
called ACE inhibitors) are medicines that block the
conversion of the chemical angiotensin I to a substance
that increases salt and water retention in the body.

Purpose
ACE inhibitors are used in the treatment of high
blood pressure. They may be used alone or in combination with other medicines for high blood pressure.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Arteries—Blood vessels that carry blood away from
the heart to the cells, tissues, and organs of the
body.
Chronic—A word used to describe a long-lasting
condition. Chronic conditions often develop gradually and involve slow changes.
Enzyme—A type of protein, produced in the body,
that brings about or speeds up chemical reactions.
Fetus—A developing baby inside the womb.
Scleroderma—A disease that first affects the skin
and later affects certain internal organs. The first
symptoms are the hardening, thickening, and
shrinking of the skin.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)—A chronic
disease that affects the skin, joints, and certain
internal organs.
Venom—A poisonous substance secreted by an
animal, usually delivered through a bite or a sting.

They work by preventing a chemical in the blood,
angiotensin I, from being converted into a substance
that increases salt and water retention in the body.
Increased salt and water retention lead to high blood
pressure. ACE inhibitors also make blood vessels
relax, which helps lower blood pressure and allows
more oxygen-rich blood to reach the heart.
Treating high blood pressure is important because
the condition puts a burden on the heart and the
arteries, which can lead to permanent damage over
time. If untreated, high blood pressure increases the
risk of heart attacks, heart failure, stroke, or kidney
failure.
ACE inhibitors may also be prescribed for other
conditions. For example, captopril (Capoten) is used
to treat kidney problems in people who take insulin to
control diabetes. Captopril and lisinopril are also
given to some patients after a heart attack. Heart
attacks damage and weaken the heart muscle, and
the damage continues even after a person recovers
from the attack. This medicine helps slow down
further damage to the heart. ACE inhibitors also
may be used to treat congestive heart failure.

Description
ACE inhibitors are available only with a physician’s prescription and come in tablet, capsule, and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

injectable forms. Some commonly used ACE inhibitors are benazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten),
enalapril (Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril
(Prinivil, Zestril), moexipril (Univasc), perindopril
(Aceon), quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace) and
trandolapril (Mavik).

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
ACE inhibitor and the medical condition for which
it is being taken. Check with the physician who
prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the
prescription for the correct dosage.
This medicine may take weeks to noticeably lower
blood pressure. Take it exactly as directed.
Do not stop taking this medicine without checking with the physician who prescribed it.

Precautions
A person taking an ACE inhibitor should see a
physician regularly. The physician will check the
blood pressure to make sure the medicine is working
as it should and will note any unwanted side effects.
People who have high blood pressure often feel perfectly fine. However, they should continue to see their
physicians even when they feel well so that the physician can keep a close watch on their condition. It is
also important for patients to keep taking their medicine even when they feel fine.
ACE inhibitors will not cure high blood pressure,
but will help control the condition. To avoid the serious health problems that high blood pressure can
cause, patients may have to take medicine for the rest
of their lives. Furthermore, medicine alone may not be
enough. Patients with high blood pressure may also
need to avoid certain foods, such as salty snacks, and
keep their weight under control. The health care professional who is treating the condition can offer advice
on what measures may be necessary. Patients being
treated for high blood pressure should not change
their diets without consulting their physicians.
Anyone taking this medicine for high blood pressure should not take any other prescription or overthe-counter (OTC) medicine without first checking
with his or her physician. Some medicines, such as
certain cold remedies, may increase blood pressure.
Some people feel dizzy or lightheaded after taking
the first dose of an ACE inhibitor, especially if they
have been taking a water pill (diuretic). Anyone who
takes these drugs should not drive, use machines or do
215

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors

anything else that might be dangerous until they have
found out how the drugs affect them. Such symptoms
should be reported to the physician or pharmacist if
they do not subside within a day or so. For the first one
or two days of taking an ACE inhibitor, patients may
become lightheaded when arising from bed in the
morning. Patienst should rise slowly to a sitting position before standing up.
While a goal of treatment with an ACE inhibitor
is to lower the blood pressure, patients must be careful
not to let their blood pressure get too low. Low blood
pressure can lead to dizziness, lightheadedness and
fainting. To prevent the blood pressure from getting
too low, observe these precautions:


Do not drink alcohol without checking with the
physician who prescribed this medicine.



Captopril and moexipril should be taken one hour
before meals. Other ACE inhinbitors may be taken
with or without meals.



Avoid overheating when exercising or in hot
weather. The loss of water from the body through
heavy sweating can cause low blood pressure.



Check with a physician right away if illness occurs
while taking an ACE inhibitor. This is especially true
if the illness involves severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Vomiting and diarrhea can cause the loss of too
much water from the body, which can lead to low
blood pressure.

Anyone who is taking ACE inhibitors should be
sure to tell the health care professional in charge
before having any surgical or dental procedures or
receiving emergency treatment.
Some ACE inhibitors may change the results of
certain medical tests, such as blood or urine tests.
Before having medical tests, anyone taking this medicine should alert the health care professional in charge.
Do not use a potassium supplement or a salt substitute that contains potassium without first checking
with the physician who prescribed the ACE inhibitor.
Patients who are being treated with bee or wasp
venom to prevent allergic reactions to stings may have
a severe allergic reaction to certain ACE inhibitors.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if
they take ACE inhibitors. Before taking these drugs,
be sure to let the physician know about any of these
conditions.
216

ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to an ACE inhibitor in the past should let his
or her physician know before taking this type of medicine again. The physician should also be told about
any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other
substances.
PREGNANCY. The use of ACE inhibitors in pregnancy can cause serious problems and even death in the
fetus or newborn. Women who are pregnant or who
may become pregnant should check with their physicians before using this medicine. Women who become
pregnant while taking this medicine should check with
their physicians immediately.
BREASTFEEDING. Some ACE inhibitors pass into
breast milk. Women who are breastfeeding should
check with their physicians before using ACE
inhibitors.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using ACE
inhibitors, people with any of these medical problems
should make sure their physicians are aware of their
conditions:


diabetes



heart or blood vessel disease



recent heart attack or stroke



liver disease



kidney disease



kidney transplant



scleroderma



systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking ACE inhibitors with certain other drugs may affect the way the
drugs work or may increase the chance of side
effects.

Side effects
The most common side effect is a dry, continuing
cough. This usually does not subside unless the medication is stopped. Ask the physician if the cough can
be treated. Less common side effects, such as headache, loss of taste, unusual tiredness, and nausea or
diarrhea also may occur and do not need medical
attention unless they are severe or they interfere with
normal activities.
More serious side effects are rare, but may occur.
If any of the following side effects occur, check with a
physician immediately:


swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, arms, legs,
hands, or feet
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

itchy skin



sudden breathing or swallowing problems



chest pain



hoarseness



sore throat



fever and chills



stomach pain



yellow eyes or skin

In addition, anyone who has any of the following symptoms while taking an ACE inhibitor
should check with his or her physician as soon as
possible:


dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting



confusion



nervousness



fever



joint pain



numbness or tingling in hands, feet, or lips



weak or heavy feeling in the legs



skin rash



irregular heartbeat



shortness of breath or other breathing problems

Other side effects may occur. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after taking an ACE inhibitor
should get in touch with his or her physician.

Interactions
ACE inhibitors may interact with certain foods
and other medicines. For example, captopril
(Capoten) interacts with food and should be taken
one hour before meals. Anyone who takes ACE inhibitors should let the physician know all other medicines he or she is taking and should ask about foods
that should be avoided. Among the foods and drugs
that may interact with ACE inhibitors are:


water pills (diuretics)



lithium, used to treat bipolar disorder



tetracycline, an antibiotic



medicines or supplements that contain potassium



salt substitutes that contain potassium

The list above may not include everything that
interacts with ACE inhibitors. Be sure to check with
a physician or pharmacist before combining ACE
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

inhibitors with any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine.

I Angiotensin-converting
enzyme test
Definition
This test measures blood levels of angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE), also known as Serum
Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (SASE). The primary function of ACE is to help regulate arterial
pressure by converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II.

Purpose
The ACE test is used primarily to detect and
monitor the clinical course of sarcoidosis (a disease
that affects many organs, especially the lungs), to differentiate between sarcoidosis and similar diseases, and to
delineate between active and inactive sarcoid disease.
Elevated ACE levels are also found in a number of
other conditions, including Gaucher’s disease (a rare
familial disorder of fat metabolism) and leprosy.

Precautions
It should be noted that people under 20 years of
age normally have very high ACE levels. Decreased
levels may be seen in the condition of excess fat in the
blood (hyperlipidemia). Drugs that may cause
decreased ACE levels include ACE inhibitor antihypertensives and steroids.

Description
ACE plays an important role in the renin/aldosterone mechanism which controls blood pressure by
converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, two proteins involved in regulating blood pressure.
Angiotensin I by itself is inactive, but when converted
by ACE to the active form, angiotensin II, it causes
narrowing of the small blood vessels in tissues, resulting in an increase in blood pressure. Angiotensin II
also stimulates the hormone aldosterone, which causes
an increase in blood pressure. Certain kidney disorders increase the production of angiotensin II, another
cause of hypertension. Despite the action of ACE on
blood pressure regulation, determination of this

enzyme is not very helpful in the evaluation of hypertension (high blood pressure).

Preparation
Determination of ACE levels requires a blood
sample. The patient need not be fasting.

Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include
slight bleeding from the puncture site, fainting or
feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma
(blood accumulating under the puncture site).

Normal results
Normal ranges for this test are laboratory-specific
but can range from 8-57 U/ml for patients over
20 years of age.

Abnormal results
Serum ACE levels are elevated in approximately
80-90% of patients with active sarcoidosis. Thyroid hormone may have an effect on ACE activity, as hypothyroid (low thyroid) patients, as well as patients with
anorexia nervosa with associated findings of hypothyroidism, may have low serum ACE activity. ACE can also be
decreased in lung cancer (bronchogenic carcinoma).

I Animal bite infections
Definition
The most common problem following an animal
bite is simple infection. The saliva of dogs, cats, ferrets,
218

and rabbits is known to contain a wide variety of
bacteria. According to one recent study, bacteria or
other pathogens show up in about 85 percent of bites.
When an animal bites, it can then transmit pathogens
into the wound. These microorganisms may grow
within the wound and cause an infection. The consequences of infection range from mild discomfort to
life-threatening complications.

Description
Two to 4.5 million animal bites occur each year in
the United States; about 1% of these bites require
hospitalization. Animal bites result in 334,000 emergency room visits per year, which represents approximately 1% of all emergency hospital visits, at an
annual cost of $100 million dollars in health care
expenses and lost income. Children are the most frequent victims of dog bites, with 5–9 year-old boys
having the highest incidence. Men are more often
bitten by dogs than are women (3:1), whereas women
are more often bitten by cats (3:1).
Dog bites make up 80–85% of all reported incidents. Cats account for about 10% of reported bites,
and other animals (including hamsters, ferrets, rabbits, horses, raccoons, bats, skunks, and monkeys)
make up the remaining 5–10%. Cat bites become
infected more frequently than dog bites. A dog’s
mouth is rich in bacteria, but only 15–20% of dog
bites become infected. In contrast, approximately
30–50% of cat bites become infected.
Many factors contribute to the infection rates,
including the type of wound inflicted, the location of
the wound, pre-existing health conditions in the bitten
person, the extent of delay before treatment, patient
compliance and the presence of a foreign body in the
wound. Dogs usually inflict crush injuries because
they have rounded teeth and strong jaws; thus, the
bite of an adult dog can exert up to 200 pounds per
square inch of pressure. This pressure usually results in
a crushing injury, causing damage to such deep structures as bones, blood vessels, tendons, muscles, and
nerves. The canine teeth in a dog’s mouth are also
sharp and strong, often inflicting lacerations. Cats,
with their needle-like incisors and carnassial teeth,
typically cause puncture wounds. Puncture wounds
appear innocuous on the surface, but the underlying
injury goes deep. Cat teeth essentially inject bacteria
into the bite, and the deep, narrow wound is difficult
to clean. Persons with impaired immunocompetence—for example, individuals with HIV infection—are especially vulnerable to infection from cat
bites. Lastly, bites or stings from marine creatures

in the absence of air or oxygen. About two-thirds of
animal bites are found to contain anaerobic disease-producing organisms.
Canines—The two sharp teeth located next to the
front incisor teeth in mammals that are used to grip
and tear.
Carnassials—The last upper premolar teeth in the
mouths of cats and other carnivores, adapted to
shear or puncture food. Carnassial teeth often
cause puncture wounds when a cat bites a human.
Culture—A laboratory procedure in which a sample from a wound, the blood or other body fluid is
taken from an infected person. The sample is placed
in conditions under which bacteria can grow. If
bacteria grow, identification tests are done to determine the bacteria species causing the infection.
Immunocompetence—An individual’s ability to
fight off infection.
Microorganisms—Microscopic organisms, such as
bacteria, viruses, algae and fungi.
Pasteurellosis—A bacterial infection caused by
Pasteurella multocida. Pasteurellosis is characterized by inflammation around the wound site and
may be accompanied by bacteria in the bloodstream and infection in tissues and organs.

(sharks, rays, eels, etc.) require immediate medical
attention as these bites may contain disease organisms
unique to the ocean environment as well as causing
severe loss of blood.
The bacterial species most commonly found
in bite wounds include Pasteurella multocida,
Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas sp, and
Streptococcus sp. P. multocida, the root cause of pasteurellosis, is especially prominent in cat bite infections. Other infectious diseases from animal bites
include cat-scratch disease, tetanus and rabies.
Doctors are increasingly aware of the importance
of checking animal bite wounds for anaerobic organisms, which are microbes that can live and multiply in
the absence of air or oxygen. A study published in 2003
reported that about two-thirds of animal bite wounds
contain anaerobes. These organisms can produce such

cats. To some extent these differences are rooted in

KEY TERMS

Animal bite infections

divergent evolutionary pathways, but they have also
been influenced by human interference through selective breeding. Dogs were first domesticated by humans
as early as 10,000 B.C. for hunting and as guard or
attack dogs. Many species travel in packs or groups
in the wild, and many human fatalities resulting from
dog bites involve a large group of dogs attacking one
or two persons. In addition, dogs typically relate to
humans according to a hierarchical model of dominance and submission, and many of the techniques of
dog training are intended to teach the dog to respect
human authority. Certain breeds of dogs are much
more likely to attack humans than others; those most
often involved in fatal attacks are pit bulls, Rottweilers,
German shepherds, huskies, and mastiffs. According to
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), there are
between 15 and 20 fatal dog attacks on humans in the
United States each year. There are several assessment
or evaluation scales that veterinarians or animal trainers can use to score individual or mixed-breed dogs
for dominant or aggressive behavior.
Unlike dogs, cats were not domesticated until
about 3000 B.C., and were important to ancient civilizations as rodent catchers and household companions
rather than as protectors or hunters of wild game.
Biologists classify cats as solitary predators rather
than as pack or herd animals; as a result, cats do not
relate to humans as authority figures in the same way
that dogs do, and they do not form groups that attack
humans when threatened or provoked. In addition,
domestic cats have been selectively bred for appearance rather than for fierceness or aggression. Most cat
bites are the result of fear on the cat’s part (as when
being placed in a carrier for a trip to the vet) or a
phenomenon known as petting-induced aggression.
Petting-induced aggression is a behavior in which a
cat that has been apparently enjoying contact with a
human suddenly turns on the human and bites. This
behavior appears to be more common in cats that had
no contact with humans during their first seven weeks
of life. In other cats, this type of aggression appears to
be related to a hypersensitive nervous system; petting
or cuddling that was pleasurable to the cat for a few
seconds or minutes becomes irritating, and the cat
bites as a way of indicating that it has had enough.
In older cats, petting-induced aggression is often a sign
that the cat feels pain from touching or pressure on
arthritic joints in its neck or back.

Causes and symptoms
The most common sign of infection from an animal bite is inflammation. The skin around the wound
is red and feels warm, and the wound may exude pus.
220

Nearby lymph glands may be swollen. Complications
can arise if the infection is not treated and spreads into
deeper structures or into the bloodstream. If the bite is
deep or occurs on the hand or at a joint, complications
are more likely.
Live disease-causing bacteria within the bloodstream and tissues cause complications far from the
wound site. Such complications include meningitis,
brain abscesses, pneumonia and lung abscesses, and
heart infections, among others. These complications
can be fatal. Deep bites or bites near joints can damage
joints and bones, causing inflammation of the bone
and bone marrow or septic arthritis.
Cat-scratch disease is caused by Bartonella
henselae, a bacterium that is carried in cat saliva;
infection may be transmitted by a bite or scratch.
Approximately 22,000 cases are reported each year in
the United States; worldwide, nine out of every
100,000 individuals become infected. More than 80%
of reported cases occur in persons under the age of 21.
The disease is not normally severe in individuals with
healthy immune systems. Symptoms may become serious, however, in immunocompromised individuals,
such as those with acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS) or those undergoing chemotherapy.
Common symptoms include an inflamed sore in the
area of the bite or scratch, swollen lymph nodes, fever,
fatigue, and rash.
Rabies is caused by a virus that is transmitted
through the bite of an animal that is already
infected. It is classified as a zoonosis, which is a
term that refers to any disease of animals that can
be transmitted to humans. More than 90% of animal
rabies cases occur in such wild animals as skunks,
bats, and raccoons, with such domestic animals as
dogs and cats accounting for fewer than 10% of
cases. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 35,000 and 50,000 individuals
worldwide die each year as a result of rabies. The
highest incidence of rabies occurs in Asia where, in
1997, over 33,000 deaths were noted, most occurring
in India. Rabies is nowadays rare in the United
States, as a result of good animal control practices.
Onset is delayed, usually weeks to months after the
person has been bitten. Early symptoms of rabies
include fever, headache, and flu-like symptoms.
These progress to anxiety, hallucinations, muscle
spasms, partial paralysis, fear of water (hydrophobia), and other neurological symptoms as the virus
spreads to the central nervous system. Medical treatment must be sought soon after exposure because
death invariably follows once the infection becomes
established.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis
A medical examination involves taking the history
of the injury and assessing the wound type and
damage. Tetanus immunization and general health
status are checked. An x ray may be ordered to assess
bone damage and to check for foreign objects in the
wound. Wound cultures are done for infected bites if
the victim is at high risk for complications or if the
infection does not respond to treatment. Evaluation of
possible exposure to rabies is also important. A biting
animal suspected of having rabies is usually apprehended, tested, and observed for a period of time for
evidence of pre-existing infection.

Treatment
Treatment depends on the wound type, its site,
and risk factors for infection. All wounds are
cleaned and disinfected as thoroughly as possible.
Bites to the head and face usually receive sutures, as
do severe lacerations elsewhere. Puncture wounds
are left open. If abscess formation occurs, the physician may perform an incision so as to drain the
abscess.
If infection occurs, antibiotics are prescribed.
Antibiotics may also be used for infection prevention. Since a single bite wound may contain many
different types of bacteria, no single antibiotic is
always effective. Commonly prescribed antibiotics
are penicillin or a combination of amoxicillin and
clavulanate potassium. Aztreonam has been
reported to be effective in treating infections caused
by P. multocida.
Because rabies is caused by a virus, antibiotics
are not effective. In addition, as of 2003, there is no
known cure for the disease once symptoms become
apparent. It is therefore recommended that individuals with a high risk of contracting the disease
(veterinarians, animal handlers, some laboratory
workers) receive preexposure vaccination. Individuals
bitten by an unknown or potentially rapid animal
should receive postexposure vaccination, also called
postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). The PEP regimen
consists of one dose of vaccine given at the initial visit
as well as one dose of human immune globulin.
Additional doses of vaccine are given on days 3, 7, 14,
and 28.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Prognosis
Once a bacterial infection is halted, the bite victim
usually recovers fully. There is no known cure for
rabies once symptoms become evident and death is
almost certain. WHO reports that 114 rabies deaths
occurred in the Americas in 1997, with only four
deaths occurring that year in the United States, thus
emphasizing the importance of good animal control
practice and postexposure prophylaxis.

Prevention
Preventing bites obviously prevents subsequent
infections. With regard to domestic pets, parents
should inform themselves about the aggression level
and other characteristics of a particular breed before
bringing a purebred pet dog into the family, and
consider having a specific dog evaluated by a veterinarian or animal behaviorist before adopting it. In
addition, parents should make sure that the dog has
been neutered or spayed, since intact dogs of either
sex are more likely to bite than those that have been
altered. Cat bites can often be prevented by learning
about a cat’s body language and recognizing the signs
of petting-induced aggression. These include dilating
pupils, a low growl, stiffening of the body, twitching
of the tail, and flattening the ears backward against
the head.
Children under 12 years of age are at a higher risk
for bites due to their small size and their inexperience
with animals; therefore, they should be supervised
with animals and taught to act appropriately around
them. In particular, children should be taught not to
tease a dog by pulling its fur or tail; to leave a dog
alone while it is eating; and to avoid running or
screaming in the presence of a dog, as the animal is
more likely to chase a moving object. Direct eye contact with a threatening dog should be avoided, as the
dog may interpret that as aggression. It is best to
stand still if at all possible, with feet together and
arms against the chest; most dogs will lose interest
in an object that is not moving, and will eventually go
away.
A wild animal that is unusually aggressive or
behaving strangely (e.g. a raccoon or bat that is active
during the daytime or is physically uncoordinated)
should be avoided and reported to the local animal
control authorities; it may be infected with the rabies
virus. Wild animals should not be taken in as pets, and
garbage or pet food that might attract wild animals
should not be left outside the home or camp site.
People should also avoid trying to break up fights
between animals and should as a rule approach

unknown cats and dogs very cautiously, especially on
their territory. Finally, animals should not be trained
to fight.
Domestic pets should be vaccinated against
rabies; people should consult a veterinarian for
advice about the frequency of booster vaccinations
for the area in which they live. In addition, people
who are traveling to countries where rabies is endemic should consider vaccination before leaving the
United States.

I Ankylosing spondylitis
Definition
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) refers to inflammation of the joints in the spine. AS is also known as
rheumatoid spondylitis or Marie-Strümpell disease
(among other names).

Description
A form of arthritis, AS is characterized by chronic
inflammation, causing pain and stiffness of the back,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Ankylosing—When bones of a joint are fused, stiff,
or rigid.
HLA-B27—An antigen or protein marker on cells
that may indicate ankylosing spondylitis.
Immune suppressing—Anything that reduces the
activity of the immune system.
Inflammation—A reaction of tissues to disease or
injury, often associated with pain and swelling.
Spondylitis—An inflammation of the spine.

Doctors usually diagnose the disease simply by
the patient’s report of pain and stiffness. Doctors
also review spinal and pelvic x rays since involvement
of the hip and pelvic joints is common and may be the
first abnormality seen on the x ray. The doctor may
also order a blood test to determine the presence of
HLA-B27 antigen. When a diagnosis is made, patients
may be referred to a rheumatologist, a doctor who
specializes in treating arthritis. Patients may also be
referred to an orthopedic surgeon, a doctor who can
surgically correct joint or bone disorders.

Treatment
progressing to the chest and neck. Eventually, the
whole back may become curved and inflexible if the
bones fuse (this is known as ‘‘bamboo spine’’). AS is a
systemic disorder that may involve multiple organs,
such as the:


eye (causing an inflammation of the iris, or iritis)



heart (causing aortic valve disease)



lungs



skin (causing a scaly skin condition, or psoriasis)



gastrointestinal tract (causing inflammation within
the small intestine, called ileitis, or inflammation of
the large intestine, called colitis)

Less than 1% of the population has AS; however,
20% of AS sufferers have a relative with the disorder.

Causes and symptoms
Genetics play an important role in the disease, but
the cause of AS is still unknown. More than 90% of
patients have a gene called HLA-B27, but only
10-15% of those who inherit the gene develop the
disease. Symptoms of AS include:


low back and hip pain and stiffness



difficulty expanding the chest



pain in the neck, shoulders, knees, and ankles



low-grade fever



fatigue



weight loss

AS is seen most commonly in males 30 years old
and older. Initial symptoms are uncommon after
the age of 30, although the diagnosis may not be
established until after that age. The incidence of AS
in Afro-Americans is about 25% of the incidence in
Caucasians.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Physical therapists prescribe exercises to prevent a
stooped posture and breathing problems when
the spine starts to fuse and ribs are affected. Back
braces may be used to prevent continued deformity
of the spine and ribs. Only in severe cases of deformity
is surgery performed to straighten and realign the
spine, or to replace knee, shoulder, or hip joints.

Alternative treatment
To reduce inflammation various herbal remedies,
including white willow (Salix alba), yarrow (Achillea
millefolium), and lobelia (Lobelia inflata), may be
helpful. Acupuncture, performed by a trained professional, has helped some patients manage their pain.
Homeopathic practitioners may prescribe such
remedies as Bryonia and Rhus toxicodendron for
pain relief.

Prognosis
There is no cure for AS, and the course of the
disease is unpredictable. Generally, AS progresses for
about 10 years and then its progression levels off.
Most patients can lead normal lives with treatment
to control symptoms.

Prevention
There is no known way to prevent AS.

Anorectal abscess see Anorectal disorders

I Anorectal disorders
Definition
Anorectal disorders are a group of medical disorders that occur at the junction of the anal canal and the
rectum.

Description
The anal canal, also called the anus, is the opening
at the bottom end of the digestive tract and is a combination of external skin and tissue from the digestive
tract. It has many sensory nerves and is sensitive to
pain. The rectum is the last section of the digestive
tract and has a mucus layer as its inside surface. It
has very few sensory nerves and is, therefore, relatively
insensitive to pain. The anal canal has a ring of muscle,
called the anal sphincter, which keeps the anus closed.
There are a number of different anorectal disorders.

Causes and symptoms
An anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anus
that is usually caused by a hard bowel movement.
Fissures are painful and bleed when the tissue is
stressed during bowel movements.
Anorectal abscesses are characterized by pusforming infections in the anorectal region. Painful
abscesses form under the skin.
An anorectal fistula is an abnormal opening or
channel from the anorectal area to another part of
the body. Typically, the channel leads to pockets of
skin near the anus. When seen in infants, anorectal
fistulas are considered birth defects. These are seen
more frequently in boys than in girls. Fistulas are
also seen more frequently in people who have other
diseases, including Crohn’s disease, tuberculosis,
cancer, and diverticulitis. Anorectal fistulas also
224

occur following anorectal abscesses or other injury
to the anal area. Fistulas are usually painful and
discharge pus.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made by visual inspection of the skin
around the anus. Also, the doctor may probe the
rectum with a gloved finger. An anoscope is a short
instrument that allows the physician to view the inside
of the anus. A proctoscope is a longer, rigid viewing
tube of approximately six to ten inches in length,
which may be used to look for anorectal disorders.
A sigmoidoscope is a longer, flexible tube, that
allows the physician to view up to about two feet of
the inside of the large intestine. Tissue samples and
material for microbial culture may be obtained during
the examination.

Treatment
Treatment usually isn’t required for hemorrhoids.
Most hemorrhoids will heal if the patient takes stool
softeners to relieve the constipation. Enlarged blood
vessels can be eliminated by surgery if they are considered
a severe problem. In the case of fissures, treatment
involves stool softeners that eliminate stress on the
fissure during bowel movements, which allows the fissure
to heal. If the fissure doesn’t heal, surgery is required.
Treatment for anorectal abscesses consists of cutting the
abscess and draining the pus. Fistulas are treated by
surgery.The usual treatment for proctitis is antibiotics.

I Anorexia nervosa
Definition
Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by unrealistic fear of weight gain, self-starvation,
and conspicuous distortion of body image. The name
comes from two Latin words that mean nervous
inability to eat. In females who have begun to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Description
Anorexia nervosa was not officially classified as a
psychiatric disorder until the third edition of DSM in
1980. It is, however, a growing problem among adolescent females. Its incidence in the United States has
doubled since 1970. The rise in the number of reported
cases reflects a genuine increase in the number of
persons affected by the disorder, and not simply earlier
or more accurate diagnosis. Estimates of the incidence
of anorexia range between 0.5–1% of caucasian female
adolescents. Over 90% of patients diagnosed with the
disorder as of 1998 are female. It was originally thought
that only 5% of anorexics are male, but that estimate is
being revised upward. The peak age range for onset of
the disorder is 14-18 years, although there are patients
who develop anorexia as late as their 40s. In the 1970s
and 1980s, anorexia was regarded as a disorder of
upper- and middle-class women, but that generalization
is also changing. More recent studies indicate that
anorexia is increasingly common among women of all
races and social classes in the United States.
Anorexia nervosa is a serious public health
problem not only because of its rising incidence, but
also because it has one of the highest mortality rates
of any psychiatric disorder. Moreover, the disorder
may cause serious long-term health complications,
including congestive heart failure, sudden death,
growth retardation, dental problems, constipation,
stomach rupture, swelling of the salivary glands, anemia and other abnormalities of the blood, loss of
kidney function, and osteoporosis.

Causes and symptoms
Anorexia is a disorder that results from the interaction of cultural and interpersonal as well as biological factors. While the precise cause of the disease is not
known, it has been linked to the following:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS
Amenorrhea—Absence of the menses in a female
who has begun to have menstrual periods.
Binge eating—A pattern of eating marked by episodes of rapid consumption of large amounts of
food; usually food that is high in calories.
Body dysmorphic disorder—A psychiatric disorder
marked by preoccupation with an imagined physical defect.
Hyperalimentation—A method of refeeding anorexics by infusing liquid nutrients and electrolytes
directly into central veins through a catheter.
Lanugo—A soft, downy body hair that develops on
the chest and arms of anorexic women.
Purging—The use of vomiting, diuretics, or laxatives
to clear the stomach and intestines after a binge.
Russell’s sign—Scraped or raw areas on the patient’s
knuckles, caused by self-induced vomiting.
Superior mesenteric artery syndrome—A condition in which a person vomits after meals due to
blockage of the blood supply to the intestine.

Social influences
The rising incidence of anorexia is thought to
reflect the present idealization of thinness as a badge
of upper-class status as well as of female beauty. In
addition, the increase in cases of anorexia includes
‘‘copycat’’ behavior, with some patients developing
the disorder from imitating other girls.
The onset of anorexia in adolescence is attributed
to a developmental crisis caused by girls’ changing
bodies coupled with society’s overemphasis on
women’s looks. The increasing influence of the mass
media in spreading and reinforcing gender stereotypes
has also been noted.
Occupational goals
The risk of developing anorexia is higher among
adolescents preparing for careers that require attention to weight and/or appearance. These high-risk
groups include dancers, fashion models, professional
athletes (including gymnasts, skaters, long-distance
runners, and jockeys), and actresses.
Genetic and biological influences
Women whose biological mothers or sisters have
the disorder appear to be at increased risk.
225

Anorexia nervosa

menstruate, anorexia nervosa is usually marked by
amenorrhea, or skipping at least three menstrual periods in a row. The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-IV
(1994), defines two subtypes of anorexia nervosa–a
restricting type, characterized by strict dieting and
exercise without binge eating; and a binge-eating/purging type, marked by episodes of compulsive eating
with or without self-induced vomiting and the use of
laxatives or enemas. DSM-IV defines a binge as a
time-limited (usually under two hours) episode of
compulsive eating in which the individual consumes
a significantly larger amount of food than most people
would eat in similar circumstances.

Anorexia nervosa

Psychological factors
A number of theories have been advanced to
explain the psychological aspects of the disorder. No
single explanation covers all cases. Anorexia nervosa
has been interpreted as:


A rejection of female sexual maturity. This rejection
is variously interpreted as a desire to remain a child,
or as a desire to resemble men as closely as possible.



A reaction to sexual abuse or assault.



A desire to appear as fragile and nonthreatening as
possible. This hypothesis reflects the idea that female
passivity and weakness are attractive to men.



Overemphasis on control, autonomy, and independence. Some anorexics come from achievementoriented families that stress physical fitness and
dieting. Many anorexics are perfectionistic and
‘‘driven’’ about schoolwork and other matters in
addition to weight control.



Evidence of family dysfunction. In some families, a
daughter’s eating disorder serves as a distraction
from marital discord or other family tensions.



Inability to interpret the body’s hunger signals accurately due to early experiences of inappropriate
feeding.
Male anorexics

Although anorexia nervosa is still considered a
disorder that largely affects women, its incidence in
the male population is rising. Less is known about the
causes of anorexia in males, but some risk factors are
the same as for females. These include certain occupational goals and increasing media emphasis on external appearance in men. Moreover, homosexual males
are under pressure to conform to an ideal body weight
that is about 20 pounds lighter than the standard
‘‘attractive’’ weight for heterosexual males.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of anorexia nervosa is complicated by a
number of factors. One is that the disorder varies
somewhat in severity from patient to patient. A second
factor is denial, which is regarded as an early sign of
the disorder. Most anorexics deny that they are ill and
are usually brought to treatment by a family member.
Most anorexics are diagnosed by pediatricians or
family practitioners. Anorexics develop emaciated
bodies, dry or yellowish skin, and abnormally low
blood pressure. There is usually a history of amenorrhea (failure to menstruate) in females, and sometimes
226

of abdominal pain, constipation, or lack of energy.
The patient may feel chilly or have developed lanugo,
a growth of downy body hair. If the patient has been
vomiting, she may have eroded tooth enamel or
Russell’s sign (scars on the back of the hand). The
second step in diagnosis is measurement of the
patient’s weight loss. DSM-IV specifies a weight loss
leading to a body weight 15% below normal, with
some allowance for body build and weight history.
The doctor will need to rule out other physical
conditions that can cause weight loss or vomiting
after eating, including metabolic disorders, brain
tumors (especially hypothalamus and pituitary gland
lesions), diseases of the digestive tract, and a condition
called superior mesenteric artery syndrome. Persons
with this condition sometimes vomit after meals
because the blood supply to the intestine is blocked.
The doctor will usually order blood tests, an electrocardiogram, urinalysis, and bone densitometry (bone
density test) in order to exclude other diseases and to
assess the patient’s nutritional status.
The doctor will also need to distinguish between
anorexia and other psychiatric disorders, including
depression, schizophrenia, social phobia, obsessivecompulsive disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder.
Two diagnostic tests that are often used are the
Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) and the Eating Disorder
Inventory (EDI).

Treatment
Treatment of anorexia nervosa includes both
short- and long-term measures, and requires assessment
by dietitians and psychiatrists as well as medical specialists. Therapy is often complicated by the patient’s
resistance or failure to carry out treatment plan.
Hospital treatment
Hospitalization is recommended for anorexics
with any of the following characteristics:


weight of 40% or more below normal; or weight loss
over a three-month period of more than 30 pounds



severely disturbed metabolism



severe binging and purging



signs of psychosis



severe depression or risk of suicide



family in crisis

Hospital treatment includes individual and group
therapy as well as refeeding and monitoring of the
patient’s physical condition. Treatment usually
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Outpatient treatment
Anorexics who are not severely malnourished can
be treated by outpatient psychotherapy. The types of
treatment recommended are supportive rather than
insight-oriented, and include behavioral approaches
as well as individual or group therapy. Family therapy
is often recommended when the patient’s eating disorder is closely tied to family dysfunction. Self-help
groups are often useful in helping anorexics find social
support and encouragement. Psychotherapy with
anorexics is a slow and difficult process; about 50%
of patients continue to have serious psychiatric problems after their weight has stabilized.

I Anoscopy
Definition
An anoscopy is an examination of the rectum in
which a small tube is inserted into the anus to screen,
diagnose, and evaluate problems of the anus and anal
canal.

Medications
Anorexics have been treated with a variety of
medications, including antidepressants, antianxiety
drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and
lithium carbonate. The effectiveness of medications
in treatment regimens is still debated. However, at
least one study of Prozac showed it helped the patient
maintain weight gained while in the hospital.

Purpose
This test may be ordered for the evaluation of
perianal or anal pain, hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse,
digital rectal examination that shows a mass, perianal
abscess and condyloma (a wart-like growth). An anascopy may be performed to check for abnormal openings between the anus and the skin, or anal fissures.
The test is also used to diagnose rectal cancer.

Prognosis
Figures for long-term recovery vary from study to
study, but the most reliable estimates are that 40-60%
of anorexics will make a good physical and social
recovery, and 75% will gain weight. The long-term
mortality rate for anorexia is estimated at around
10%, although some studies give a lower figure of
3-4%. The most frequent causes of death associated
with anorexia are starvation, electrolyte imbalance,
heart failure, and suicide.

Prevention
Short of major long-term changes in the larger
society, the best strategy for prevention of anorexia
is the cultivation of healthy attitudes toward food,
weight control, and beauty (or body image) within
families.

Precautions
Anoscopy should not be performed on patients
with acute cardiovascular problems due to the vasovagal reaction it may cause. This test is also not recommended for patients with acute abdominal problems
and those with a constricted or narrowed anal canal.

Description
Anoscopy views the anus and anal canal by using
an anoscope. An anoscope is a plastic, tube-shaped
speculum that is a smaller version of a sigmoidscope.
Before the anoscope is used, the doctor completes a
digital rectal examination with a lubricated, gloved
index finger. The anoscope is then lubricated and
gently inserted a few inches into the rectum. This
procedure enlarges the rectum to allow the doctor to
view the entire anal canal with a light. If any suspicious
areas are noticed, a piece of tissue can be biopsied.
During the anoscopy procedure there may be a
feeling of pressure or the need to go to the bathroom.
If a biopsy is taken, the patient may feel a slight pinch.
227

Anoscopy

requires two to four months in the hospital. In extreme
cases, hospitalized patients may be force-fed through a
tube inserted in the nose (nasogastric tube) or by overfeeding (hyperalimentation techniques).

Polyps—A tumor with a small flap that attaches
itself to the wall of various vascular organs such as
the nose, uterus and rectum. Polyps bleed easily,
and if they are suspected to be cancerous they
should be surgically removed.

The procedure is performed on an out-patient basis,
and takes approximately an hour to complete.

Preparation
The patient will be instructed to clear their rectum
of stool before the procedure. This may be done by
taking a laxative, enema, or other preparation that
may help with the evacuation.

Aftercare
If a biopsy is needed during an anoscopy, there may
be slight anal bleeding for less than two days following
the procedure. The patient may be instructed to sit in a
bathtub of warm water for 10 to 15 minutes, three
times a day, to help decrease the pain and swelling.

Risks
A simple anoscopy procedure offers minimal
risks. There is a limited risk of bleeding and mild
pain is a biopsy is performed.

Normal results
Normal values to look for during an anoscopy
include an anal canal that appears healthy in size,
color, and shape. The test also looks for no evidence of
bleeding, polyps, hemorrhoids or other abnormalities.

Abnormal results
While an anoscopy is typically performed to
determine is hemorrhoids are present, other abnormal
finding could include polyps, abscesses, inflammation,
fissures, colorectal polyps, or cancer.
228

I Anosmia
Definition
The term anosmia means lack of the sense of
smell. It may also refer to a decreased sense of smell.
Ageusia, a companion word, refers to a lack of taste
sensation. Patients who actually have anosmia may
complain wrongly of ageusia, although they retain
the ability to distinguish salt, sweet, sour, and bitter–
humans’ only taste sensations.

Description
Of the five senses, smell ranks fourth in importance
for humans, although it is much more pronounced in
other animals. Bloodhounds, for example, can smell an
odor a thousand times weaker than humans. Taste,
considered the fifth sense, is mostly the smell of food
in the mouth. The sense of smell originates from the
first cranial nerves (the olfactory nerves), which sit at
the base of the brain’s frontal lobes, right behind the
eyes and above the nose. Inhaled airborne chemicals
stimulate these nerves.
There are other aberrations of smell beside a
decrease. Smells can be distorted, intensified, or hallucinated. These changes usually indicate a malfunction
of the brain.

Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of anosmia is nasal
occlusion caused by rhinitis (inflammation of the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Allergen—Any substance that irritates only those
who are sensitive (allergic) to it.

membranes.
Nasal polyps—Drop-shaped overgrowths of the
nasal membranes.

nasal membranes). If no air gets to the olfactory
nerves, smell will not happen. In turn, rhinitis and
nasal polyps (growths on nasal membranes) are caused
by irritants such as allergens, infections, cigarette
smoke, and other air pollutants. Tumors such as
nasal polyps can also block the nasal passages and
the olfactory nerves and cause anosmia. Head injury
or, rarely, certain viral infections can damage or
destroy the olfactory nerves.

first step to healing. Nasal steams with essential oils
offer relief of the blockage and tonification of the
membranes. Blockages can sometimes be resolved
through naso-specific therapy–a way of realigning
the nasal cavities. Polyp blockage can be addressed
through botanical medicine treatment as well as
hydrotherapy. Olfactory nerve damage may not be
regenerable. Some olfactory aberrations, like intensified sense of smell, can be resolved using homeopathic
medicine.

Prognosis
If nasal inflammation is the cause of anosmia, the
chances of recovery are excellent. However, if nerve
damage is the cause of the problem, the recovery of
smell is much more difficult.

J. Ricker Polsdorfer, MD

Diagnosis
It is difficult to measure a loss of smell, and no one
complains of loss of smell in just one nostril. So a
physician usually begins by testing each nostril separately with a common, non-irritating odor such as
perfume, lemon, vanilla, or coffee. Polyps and rhinitis
are obvious causal agents a physician looks for.
Imaging studies of the head may be necessary in
order to detect brain injury, sinus infection, or tumor.

Treatment
Cessation of smoking is the first step. Many smokers who quit discover new tastes so enthusiastically
that they immediately gain weight. Attention to reducing exposure to other nasal irritants and treatment of
respiratory allergies or chronic upper respiratory
infections will be beneficial. Corticosteroids are particularly helpful.

Alternative treatment
Finding and treating the cause of the loss of smell
is the first approach in naturopathic medicine. If rhinitis is the cause, treating acute rhinitis with herbal mast
cell stabilizers and herbal decongestants can offer some
relief as the body heals. If chronic rhinitis is present,
this is often related to an environmental irritant or to
food allergies. Removal of the causative factors is the

Anoxemia see Anoxia

I Anoxia
Definition
Anoxia is a condition characterized by an absence
of oxygen supply to an organ or a tissue.

Description
Anoxia results when oxygen is not being delivered
to a part of the body. If the condition does not involve
total oxygen deprivation, it is often called hypoxia,
although the two terms have been used interchangeably. A related condition, anoxemia, occurs when the
blood circulates but contains a below normal amount
of oxygen.
The five types of anoxia or hypoxia include
hypoxemic, anemic, affinity, stagnant, and histotoxic.
Hypoxemic anoxia happens when the oxygen pressure
outside the body is so low that the hemoglobin, the
chemical which carries oxygen in the red blood cells
(RBCs), is unable to become fully loaded with the gas.
This results in too little oxygen reaching the tissues
and can occur in suffocation when a person is at high

KEY TERMS
Amnesia—Loss of memory often traceable to brain

Anoxemia—An extreme lack of oxygen in the blood.
Hemoglobin—A chemical found in red blood cells
that transports oxygen.
Myoclonus—Involuntary contractions of a muscle
or group of muscles.

altitude, where the pressure of oxygen in the air is
much less than at sea level.
Anemic anoxia results from a decrease in the
amount of hemoglobin or RBCs in the blood, which
reduces the ability to get oxygen to the tissues. Anemia
may result from lack of production of red blood cells
(iron deficiency), blood loss (hemorrhage), or shortened lifespan of red blood cells (autoimmune disease).
Affinity anoxia involves a defect in the chemistry
of the blood such that the hemoglobin can no longer
pick up as much oxygen from the air, even though the
quantities are normal, reducing how much is delivered
to the tissues.
Stagnant anoxia occurs when there is interference
with the blood flow, although the blood and its
oxygen-carrying abilities are normal. A common
cause of general stagnant anoxia is heart disease or
interference with the return of blood flow through the
veins. Examples of local stagnant anoxia include exposure to cold, diseases that restrict circulation to the
extremities, and ergot poisoning. When the tissue or
organ itself has a reduced ability to accept and use the
oxygen, it is called histotoxic anoxia. The classic example is cyanide poisoning, where the chemical inactivates a cellular enzyme necessary for the cell to use
oxygen. Thus, tissue exposed to cyanide cannot use the
oxygen even though it is in normal amounts in the
bloodstream. Histotoxic anoxia can also be caused
by exposure to narcotics, alcohol, formaldehyde, acetone, toluene, and certain anesthetic agents.

through mountain climbing or travel in an insufficiently
pressurized airplane. Anoxia, and the resultant brain
damage, is a particular problem with newborns during
difficult births.
No matter what the cause of anoxia, the symptoms are similar. In severe cases, the patient is often
confused and commonly stuperous or comatose (in a
state of unconsciousness). Depending on the severity
of the injury to the brain, the organ most sensitive to
reduced oxygen intake, this condition can persist for
hours, days, weeks, or even months or years. Seizures,
myoclonic jerks (involuntary muscle spasms or
twitches), and neck stiffness are some other symptoms
of the anoxic condition.
Symptoms of more localized or less complete oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) include increased breathing
rate, lightheadedness, dizziness, tingling or warm sensation, sweating, reduced field of vision, sleepiness, a
bluish tint to skin, particularly the fingertips and lips,
and behavior changes, often an inappropriate sense of
euphoria.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of anoxia and hypoxia is commonly
made through the appearance of clinical symptoms.
However, suspected reduction in oxygen reaching the
tissues can be confirmed using laboratory tests. The
exact test that is performed is dependent on the suspected cause of the anoxia. One systemic measure of
tissue anoxia is the serum lactate (lactic acid) test.
When cells are forced to produce energy without oxygen, as would happen during anoxia, lactic acid is one
of the byproducts. Thus, an increase in lactic acid in
the blood would indicate that tissues were starved for
oxygen and are using non-oxygen pathways to produce energy. Normally, the blood contains less than
2mmol/L of lactic acid. However, some forms of
anoxia do not increase lactic acid concentrations in
the blood and some increases in lactic acid levels are
not associated with anoxia, so an elevated value for
this test is only suggestive of an anoxic or hypoxic
condition.

Treatment
Causes and symptoms
Anoxia and hypoxia can be caused by any number
of disease states of the blood, lungs, heart and circulation
including heart attack, severe asthma, or emphysema.
It can also result from smoke or carbon monoxide inhalation, improper exposure to anesthesia, poisoning,
strangulation, near-drowning, or high altitude exposure
230

The exact treatment for anoxia is dependent on
the cause of the reduced oxygen reaching the tissues.
However, immediate restoration of tissue oxygen
levels through supplementing the patient’s air supply
with 100% oxygen is a common first step. Secondary
steps often include support of the cardiovascular system through drugs or other treatment, treatment of

disorders/anoxia_doc.htm>.

Michelle Johnson, MS, JD

Prognosis
A good prognosis is dependent on the ability to
treat the underlying cause of the low oxygen levels. If
cardiovascular and respiratory systems can be supported adequately, recovery from the injury to the
tissue is possible, although extent of injury to the
brain can be difficult to assess. The exact amount of
recovery varies with the amount of injury sustained,
where significant injury brings a poorer prognosis. As
recovery occurs, both psychological and neurological
abnormalities may appear, persist, and can improve.
Some problems seen after anoxia include mental confusion, personality changes, amnesia or other types of
memory loss, hallucinations, and persistent myoclonus
(involuntary contractions of the muscles).

Prevention
Hypoxemic anoxia can be avoided by utilizing
supplemental oxygen when in high altitudes and
being aware of the early symptoms of altitude sickness and reducing altitude once recognized. Iron supplements can avoid anemic hypoxia, although more
severe anemic states are usually caused by disease or
bleeding. Maintaining good cardiovascular health
through proper diet and exercise is a good first step
to avoiding the most common cause of stagnant
anoxia. Avoiding exposure to the toxic chemicals
that cause the condition can prevent histotoxic
anoxia.

I Antacids
Definition
Antacids are medicines that neutralize stomach acid.

Purpose
Antacids are used to relieve acid indigestion, upset
stomach, sour stomach, and heartburn. Additional
components of some formulations include dimethicone, to reduce gas pains (flatulence) and alginic
acid, which, in combination with antacids, may help
manage GERD (gastro-esophageal reflux disease).
Antacids should not be confused with gastric acid
inhibitors, such as the H-2 receptor blockers (cimetidine, ranitide and others) or the proton pump inhibitors
(lansoprazole, omeprazole and others). Although all
three classes of drugs act to reduce the levels of gastric
acid, their mechanisms are different, and this affects
the appropriate use of the drug. Antacids have a rapid
onset and short duration of action, and are most
appropriate for rapid relief of gastric discomfort for
a short period of time.
Antacids may be divided into two classes, those
that work by chemical neutralization of gastric acid,
most notably sodium bicarbonate; and those that act
by adsorption of the acid (non-absorbable antacids),
such as calcium and magnesium salts.
The chemical antacids show the most rapid onset
of action, but may cause ‘‘acid rebound,’’ a condition
in which the gastric acid returns in greater concentration after the drug effect has stopped. Also, since
these antacids may contain high concentrations of
sodium, they may be inappropriate in patients with
hypertension.
Calcium and magnesium salts act by adsorption
of the acid, and are less prone to the rebound effect,
but may have other significant disadvantages. These
antacids are particularly prone to drug interactions,
and patients taking other medications must often
avoid simultaneous administration of the medications. These antacids are more effective in liquid formulations than in tablet or capsule form, and so may
be inconvenient for routine dosing.

lung disease, transfusions, or administration of anecdotes for poisoning, as appropriate.

Antacids

KEY TERMS
Acid indigestion—Indigestion that results from too
much acid in the stomach.
Chronic—A word used to describe a long-lasting
condition. Chronic conditions often develop gradually and involve slow changes.
Heartburn—A burning sensation, usually in the
center of the chest, near the breastbone.
Indigestion—A feeling of discomfort or illness that
results from the inability to properly digest food.
Inflamed bowel—Irritation of the intestinal tract.
Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat
that usually develop in response to injury or illness.
Pregnancy safety categories—A system for reporting the known safety issues of drugs for use during
pregnancy, The ratings range from A, proven safe
by well controlled studies, to X, proven harmful.

The non-absorbable antacids may have additional
uses beyond control of hyperacidity. Calcium salts
may be used as diet supplements in prevention of
osteoporosis. Aluminum carbonate is useful for binding phosphate, and has been effective in treatment and
control of hyperphosphatemia or for use with a low
phosphate diet to prevent formation of phosphate
urinary stones. This application is particularly valuable in patients with chronic renal failure. Antacids
with aluminum and magnesium hydroxides or aluminum hydroxide alone effectively prevent significant
stress ulcer bleeding in post-operative patients or
those with severe burns.

Recommended dosage
The dose depends on the type of antacid. Consult
specific references.
When using antacids in chewable tablet form,
chew the tablet well before swallowing. Drink a glass
of water after taking chewable aluminum hydroxide.
Lozenges should be allowed to dissolve completely in
the mouth. Liquid antacids should be shaken well
before using.

Precautions
Antacids should be avoided if any signs of appendicitis or inflamed bowel are present. These include
cramping, pain, and soreness in the lower abdomen,
bloating, and nausea and vomiting.
232

Antacids may affect the results of some medical
tests, such as those that measure how much acid
the stomach produces. Health care providers and
patients should keep this in mind when scheduling a
medical test.
Antacids that contain magnesium may cause diarrhea. Other types of antacids may cause constipation.
Avoid taking antacids containing sodium bicarbonate when the stomach is uncomfortably full from
eating or drinking.
Antacids should not be given to children under six
years of age.
Antacids that contain calcium or sodium bicarbonate may cause side effects, such as dizziness, nausea,
and vomiting, in people who consume large amounts
of calcium (from dairy products or calcium supplements). In some cases, this can lead to permanent
kidney damage. Before combining antacids with
extra calcium, check with a physician.
Some antacids contain large amounts of sodium,
particularly sodium bicarbonate (baking soda).
Anyone who is on a low-sodium diet should check
the list of ingredients or check with a physician or
pharmacist before taking an antacid product.
Excessive use of antacids may cause or increase
the severity or kidney problems. Calcium based antacids may lead to renal stone formation.
PREGNANCY. Antacids are not classified under
the pregnancy safety categories A, B, C, D and X.
Occasional use of antacids in small amounts during
pregnancy is considered safe. However, pregnant
women should check with their physicians before using
antacids or any other medicines. Pregnant women
who are consuming extra calcium should be aware
that using antacids that contain sodium bicarbonate or
calcium can lead to serious side effects.
BREASTFEEDING. Some antacids may pass into
breast milk. However, no evidence exists that the
ingestion of antacids through breast milk causes problems for nursing babies whose mothers use antacids
occasionally.

Side effects
Side effects are very rare when antacids are taken
as directed. They are more likely when the medicine is
taken in large doses or over a long time. Minor side
effects include a chalky taste, mild constipation or
diarrhea, thirst, stomach cramps, and whitish or
speckled stools. These symptoms do not need medical
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Other uncommon side effects may occur. Anyone
who has unusual symptoms after taking antacids
should get in touch with his or her health care provider.

Interactions
Antacids have multiple drug interactions, usually
due to inhibition of absorption of other medications.
In rare cases, the absorbable antacids may alter the
pH of the stomach contents or urine sufficiently to
alter drug absoprtion or excretion. Consult specific
references.

I Antenatal testing
Definition
Antenatal testing includes any diagnostic procedures performed before the birth of a baby.

Purpose
These tests and exams are essential for protecting
the health of a pregnant woman and her developing
child.

KEY TERMS
Ultrasound — A device that records sound waves
as they bounce off a developing fetus to create an
image, which is projected onto a large computer
screen
Breech position—When a child is oriented feet
first in the mother’s uterus just before delivery.
Alpha fetoprotein screen — A test that measures
the level of alpha fetoprotein, a substance produced by a fetus with birth defects, in the mother’s
blood.
Amniocentesis— An invasive procedure that
allows physicians to check for birth defects by collecting a sample of fetal cells from inside the
amniotic sac.
GBS— Group B streptococci are a type of bacteria
that, if passed to a can cause inflammation of the
brain, spinal cord, blood or lungs. In some cases, it
can result in infant death

When a woman first learns she is pregnant, her
physician will run a series of routine urine and blood
tests to determine her blood type, check for anemia
and gestational diabetes, make sure she is immune to
rubella (German measles) and check for infectious
diseases like HIV, hepatitis, chlamydia or syphilis.
Physicians also usually do pelvic exam to screen for
cervical cancer and check the patient’s blood pressure.
As the pregnancy progresses, more tests will follow.
Ultrasound

Precautions
Some tests, such as amniocentisis, carry a small
risk of a miscarriage or other complications that could
harm the mother or baby.

Description
Women who become pregnant undergo a wide
variety of tests throughout the nine months before
delivery. In the early stages, physicians order blood
tests to screen for possible disorders or infections, such
as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which can
pass from the mother to the fetus. Later, the focus
shifts to checking on fetal well-being with a variety of
technological tools such as ultrasound scans.
Descriptions of the most common tests and procedures used during pregnancy are listed below.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Ultrasound is a device that records sound waves
as they bounce off the developing fetus to create an
image, which is projected onto a large computer
screen. Physicians order an ultrasound scan to listen
for a fetal heartbeat, determine a woman’s precise due
date and check for twins, among other uses. An ultrasound scan also is known as a sonogram. The procedure takes a few minutes, is painless and usually is
covered by health insurance.
The ultrasound technician will ask the pregnant
woman to remove her clothes and change into a gown.
The technician may rub some gel on the woman’s stomach, which helps the hand-held device pick up sound
waves better. In certain cases, the technician may insert
a plastic probe into the woman’s vaginal canal to get a
clearer picture of the fetus. Early in pregnancy, the
test may need to be done with a full bladder.
233

Antenatal testing

attention unless they do not go away or they interfere
with normal activities.

Antenatal testing

Unlike x rays, ultrasound is safe to use during
pregnancy. It does not cause any known side-effects
that would harm the mother or baby.

In about one out of every 1,000 cases, amniocentesis causes a needle to puncture the uterine wall,
which could result in miscarriage.

Pregnant women usually will have their first ultrasound anytime between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation. In
normal cases, the technician is able to identify a fetal
heartbeat, which appears as a flashing light on the
screen. Closer to the due date, physicians use ultrasound to make sure the fetus is in the correct position
to exit the birth canal head first.

In most cases, couples find out their baby does not
have a birth defect.

Sometimes an ultrasound will show that a fetus
has stopped growing, or a gestational sac has formed
without a fetus, and a miscarriage has occurred. Later
in pregnancy, it also may show that the child is in a
breech position, oriented feet first, which can cause a
difficult labor.
Tests for birth defects

If the results come back positive for Down’s
Syndrome or other serious conditions, the couple
must decide if they want to end the pregnancy.
Others use the knowledge to plan and prepare any
special care needed for their future child.
Group B Strep
This test is for Group B streptococci (GBS)
infection.
By testing for GBS, physicians can determine if
a woman is at risk of passing this infection along to
her child.

Most obstetricians offer parents a variety of ways
to find out if their developing child might have birth
defects such as spina bifida and Down Syndrome. An
alpha fetoprotein screen can be done through a simple
blood test in the doctor’s office between the 16th and
18th week of gestation. It tells the odds that their child
will have a severe congenital anomaly. The test works
by measuring the level of alpha fetoprotein, a substance produced by a fetus with birth defects. Low
levels of alpha fetoprotein in the mother’s blood may
indicate Down’s Syndrome. In that case, the next step
for most couples is amniocentesis because the alpha
fetoprotein test can give false-positive results.
Amniocentesis is a more accurate test, but it also has
higher risks of complications.

GBS is a type of bacteria commonly found in the
vagina and rectum. Unlike regular strep throat, GBS
can be present in a person’s body without causing any
symptoms, so many women do not realize they are
infected with it.

This procedure typically is used to diagnose Down
syndrome while a developing child is still in the womb,
at 15-28 weeks.

This is a routine urine test or pelvic exam with no
side effects.

During amniocentesis, a doctor inserts a needle
through a woman’s vaginal canal and inside her cervix. Using ultrasound as a guide, the doctor pierces the
uterus to withdraw a sample of fluid from the amniotic
sac. Afterwards, tiny cells shed by the fetus can be
studied in the laboratory. Scientists can analyze
DNA samples to determine if the fetus has Down
syndrome or other genetic conditions. Amniocentesis
also can determine the sex of the fetus.
Women who have a history of recurring miscarriages may not want to have this procedure.
Amniocentesis is usually performed in a doctor’s
office on an outpatient basis.
Common side effects include cramping and
bleeding.
234

Women who have had a prior child with GBS, or
who have a fever or prolonged or premature rupture of
the amniotic sac may be at higher risk for this type of
infection.

To test for the presence of GBS, doctors may take
a urine sample. They also may collect samples from the
vagina or rectum, which are then analyzed in a lab.
This test is usually performed late in pregnancy, at
35-37 weeks of gestation.

In many cases, doctors do not find any evidence of
this type of infection.
If a woman is found to be infected with Group B
strep, physicians usually wait to treat it until just
before labor begins. At that time, they may give the
mother antibiotics so the baby is not born with the
infection. Newborns who are exposed to Group B
strep can have inflammation of the brain, spinal
cord, blood or lungs. In some cases, this serious complication can result in infant death.

I Antepartum testing
Definition
Antepartum testing consists of a variety of tests
performed late in pregnancy to verify fetal well-being,
as judged by the baby’s heart rate and other characteristics. Antepartum tests include the nonstress test
(NST), biophysical profile, and contraction stress
test (CST).

Purpose
Antepartum testing is performed after 32 weeks of
pregnancy so that the couple and the doctor can be
warned of any problems that may necessitate further
testing or immediate delivery. The results reflect the
adequacy of blood flow (and oxygen delivery) to the
fetus from the placenta.
Antepartum tests are usually done in pregnancies
at high risk for fetal complications. Various reasons
include:


any chronic illness in the mother, such as high blood
pressure or diabetes



problems with previous pregnancies, such as
stillbirth



fetal complications, such as intrauterine growth retardation (a slowing of growth of the fetus) or birth
defects



problems in the current pregnancy, including preeclampsia (serious pregnancy-induced high blood
pressure), gestational (pregnancy-related) diabetes,
premature rupture of the membranes, excessive
amniotic fluid (the liquid that surrounds the fetus),
vaginal bleeding, or placenta previa (a condition in

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

which the placenta is positioned over the cervix
instead of near the top of the uterus)


twins or other multiple fetuses

One of the most common indications for antepartum testing is post-term pregnancy. A pregnancy
should not be allowed to continue past 42 weeks.
(The usual pregnancy is 40 weeks in duration).
Babies should be monitored with antepartum testing
starting at 41 weeks. After 41 weeks, there is an
increasing risk that the placenta cannot meet the growing baby’s needs for oxygen and nutrition. This may be
reflected in decreased movements of the baby,
decreased amniotic fluid, and changes in the heart
rate pattern of the baby.

Description
Technology
The NST and CST use a technique called electronic fetal monitoring to evaluate the heartbeat of the
fetus. The biophysical profile is an ultrasound
examination.
NST
The NST is usually the first antepartum test used to
verify fetal well-being. It is based on the principle that
when the fetus moves, its heartbeat normally speeds up.
The NST assesses fetal health through monitoring
accelerations of the heart rate in response to the
baby’s own movements, i.e., in the absence of stress.
235

Antepartum testing

PERIODICALS

Antepartum testing

The mother lays down or sits, and an electronic
fetal monitor is placed on her abdomen to monitor the
fetal heart rate. The doctor records the baby’s heartbeat on a graph or ‘‘tracing’’ to determine whether it
demonstrates correct reactivity, or acceleration of the
heart rate. To record fetal movements on the tracing,
the mother presses a button every time she feels the
baby move. If the baby is inactive, the mother may be
asked to rub her abdomen to ‘‘awaken’’ it. Sometimes
an instrument is used to produce a loud noise to arouse
the fetus (vibroacoustic stimulation). The test usually
takes between 20–45 minutes.
A baby who is receiving enough oxygen should
move at least twice in a 20 minute period. The baby’s
heart rate should increase at least 20 beats per minute
for at least 20 seconds during these movements. The
NST is the simplest and cheapest antepartum test.
Biophysical profile
The biophysical profile is an ultrasound exam that
can add additional information to the NST. During
the biophysical profile, the examiner checks for various characteristics of the baby to evaluate its overall
health. These include: fetal movement, fetal tone,
breathing movements, and the amniotic fluid volume.
Amniotic fluid volume is important because a
decreased amount raises the possibility that the baby
may be under stress. The five components of the test
(NST is also included) are each given a score of 2 for
normal (or present), 1 if decreased, and 0 for abnormal. The highest possible score is 10. The ‘‘modified’’
biophysical profile is another option; this includes
only the NST and amniotic fluid volume.
CST
The CST is like the NST, except that the fetus is
evaluated in response to contractions of the mother’s
uterus. Because it is a more complicated test, it is often
used after an abnormal NST to confirm the results.
Uterine contractions produce ‘‘stress’’ in the fetus
because they temporarily stop the flow of blood and
oxygen. The CST is used to confirm that the fetus does
not respond to this stress by a decrease in the heart rate.
The CST is performed with the same equipment as
the NST. Maternal blood pressure and fetal heart rate
are recorded along with the onset, relative intensity,
and duration of any spontaneous contractions. For an
accurate test, the contractions should be of sufficient
duration and frequency. If uterine activity does not
occur naturally, a drug called oxytocin may be given to
the mother intravenously (hence the test’s alternate
name, the oxytocin challenge test) to provoke
236

contractions. Another option is self-stimulation of
the mother’s nipples, because this releases natural
oxytocin. The fetal heart rate is observed until, ideally,
three moderate contractions occur within 10 minutes.

Preparation
The mother should eat just before the antepartum
tests to help stimulate fetal activity.

Risks
There are no appreciable risks from the NST or
the biophysical profile. Ultrasound used for the biophysical profile is painless and safe because it uses no
harmful radiation, and no evidence has been found
that sound waves cause any adverse effects on the
mother or fetus.
The frequency of antepartum testing depends on
the reason for its use. All of the tests occasionally give
incorrect results, which may prompt an unnecessary
early delivery or cesarean. Repeat testing is important
to double-check any abnormal findings.

Normal results
In general, ‘‘negative’’ or normal results on antepartum testing provide reassurance that the baby is
healthy and should remain so for perhaps a week, with
no need for immediate delivery. Unfortunately, the
tests cannot guarantee that there are no problems,
because falsely normal results can occur, though this
is unusual. Even if all test results are normal, it is
important to realize that this does not guarantee a
‘‘perfect’’ baby.
The NST is normal (‘‘reactive’’) if two or more
distinct fetal movements occur in association with
appropriate accelerations of the fetal heart rate within
20 minutes. A biophysical profile score of 8-10 is considered reassuring. The CST is normal if the fetus
shows no decelerations in heart rate in response to
three uterine contractions within 10 minutes.

Abnormal results
A ‘‘positive’’ result suggests that the baby is not
receiving enough oxygen for some reason. However, it
is quite possible that the test result was falsely abnormal. To confirm or monitor a suspected disorder,
follow-up testing with the same or an alternate test
will probably be performed at least weekly.
The NST is abnormal (‘‘nonreactive’’) if the fetal
heart rate fails to speed up by at least 20 beats per
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Anthrax

minute at least two times during a 20-minute period.
Abnormal decreases in the heart rate (decelerations)
are also a cause for concern.
A biophysical profile score of 6 is considered a
cause for concern and should be followed by further
testing. Scores of 4 or less may require immediate
delivery of the fetus.
Abnormal results on the CST include late decelerations, or abnormal slowing of the fetal heart rate
after the uterine contractions. This can suggest that
the baby is not receiving enough oxygen and may have
difficulty withstanding the stress of labor and vaginal
delivery. Cesarean section might be necessary so the
baby can be spared the stress of labor. With either
NST or CST, a severe deceleration (a period of very
slow heartbeat) can also suggest fetal distress.
The ultimate outcome will depend on the woman’s
individual situation. In some cases, delivery can be postponed while medication is given to the mother (e.g., for
high blood pressure) or the fetus (e.g., to speed up lung
maturity before delivery). Depending upon the readiness
of the mother’s cervix, the doctor may decide to induce
labor. The extra-large fetus of a diabetic woman may
require cesarean delivery; severe preeclampsia also may
necessitate induction of labor or cesarean section. The
doctor will determine the most prudent course of action.

that can occasionally spread to humans, affecting
either the skin, intestines, or lungs. In humans, the
infection can often be treated, but it is almost always
fatal in animals.

Description
Anthrax is most often found in the agricultural
areas of South and Central America, southern and
eastern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the
Middle East. In the United States, anthrax is rarely
reported; however, cases of animal infection with
anthrax are most often reported in Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota. The bacterium and its associated disease get their name from
the Greek word meaning ‘‘coal’’ because of the characteristic coal-black sore that is the hallmark of the
most common form of the disease.
During the 1800s, in England and Germany,
anthrax was known either as ‘‘wool-sorter’s’’ or ‘‘ragpicker’s’’ disease because workers contracted the disease from bacterial spores present on hides and in
wool or fabric fibers. Spores are the small, thickwalled dormant stage of some bacteria that enable
them to survive for long periods of time under adverse
conditions. The first anthrax vaccine was perfected in
1881 by Louis Pasteur.
The largest outbreak ever recorded in the United
States occurred in 1957 when nine employees of a goat
hair processing plant became ill after handling a contaminated shipment from Pakistan. Four of the five
patients with the pulmonary form of the disease died.
Other cases appeared in the 1970s when contaminated
goatskin drumheads from Haiti were brought into the
U.S. as souvenirs.

KEY TERMS
Antibody—A specific protein produced by the
immune system in response to a specific foreign
protein or particle called an antigen.
Antitoxin—An antibody that neutralizes a toxin.
Bronchitis—Inflammation of the mucous membrane of the bronchial tubes of the lung that can
make it difficult to breathe.
Cutaneous—Pertaining to the skin
Meningitis—Inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord called the
meninges.
Pulmonary—Having to do with the lungs or
respiratory system.
Spore—A dormant form assumed by some bacteria, such as anthrax, that enable the bacterium
to survive high temperatures, dryness, and lack of
nourishment for long periods of time. Under proper
conditions, the spore may revert to the actively
multiplying form of the bacteria.

Today, anthrax is rare, even among cattle, largely
because of widespread animal vaccination. However,
some serious epidemics continue to occur among animal herds and in human settlements in developing
countries due to ineffective control programs. In
humans, the disease is almost always an occupational
hazard, contracted by those who handle animal hides
(farmers, butchers, and veterinarians) or sort wool.
There are no reports of the disease spreading from
one person to another.
Anthrax as a weapon
There has been a great deal of recent concern
that the bacteria that cause anthrax may be used as
a type of biological warfare, since it is possible to
become infected simply by inhaling the spores, and
inhaled anthrax is the most serious form of the
disease. The bacteria can be grown in laboratories,
and with a great deal of expertise and special equipment, the bacteria can be altered to be usable as a
weapon.
The largest-ever documented outbreak of human
anthrax contracted through spore inhalation occurred
in Russia in 1979, when anthrax spores were accidentally released from a military laboratory, causing a
regional epidemic that killed 69 of its 77 victims. In
238

the United States in 2001, terrorists converted anthrax
spores into a powder that could be inhaled and mailed
it to intended targets, including news agencies and
prominent individuals in the federal government.
Because the United States government considers
anthrax to be of potential risk to soldiers, the
Department of Defense has begun systematic vaccination of all military personnel against anthrax.
For civilians in the United States, the government
has instituted a program called the National
Pharmaceutical Stockpile program in which antibiotics and other medical materials to treat two million
people are located so that they could be received anywhere in the country within twelve hours following a
disaster or terrorist attack.

Causes and symptoms
The naturally occurring bacterium Bacillus
anthracis produces spores that can remain dormant
for years in soil and on animal products, such as
hides, wool, hair, or bones. The disease is often fatal
to cattle, sheep, and goats, and their hides, wool, and
bones are often heavily contaminated.
The bacteria are found in many types of soil, all
over the world, and usually do not pose a problem for
humans because the spores stay in the ground. In
order to infect a human, the spores have to be released
from the soil and must enter the body. They can enter
the body through a cut in the skin, through consuming
contaminated meat, or through inhaling the spores.
Once the spores are in the body, and if antibiotics are
not administered, the spores become bacteria that
multiply and release a toxin that affects the immune
system. In the inhaled form of the infection, the
immune system can become overwhelmed and the
body can go into shock.
Symptoms vary depending on how the disease was
contracted, but the symptoms usually appear within
one week of exposure.
Cutaneous anthrax
In humans, anthrax usually occurs when the
spores enter a cut or abrasion, causing a skin (cutaneous) infection at the site. Cutaneous anthrax, as this
infection is called, is the mildest and most common
form of the disease. At first, the bacteria cause an
itchy, raised area like an insect bite. Within one to
two days, inflammation occurs around the raised
area, and a blister forms around an area of dying tissue
that becomes black in the center. Other symptoms may
include shivering and chills. In most cases, the bacteria
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Inhalation anthrax
Inhaling the bacterial spores can lead to a rare,
often-fatal form of anthrax known as pulmonary or
inhalation anthrax that attacks the lungs and sometimes
spreads to the brain. Inhalation anthrax begins with flulike symptoms, namely fever, fatigue, headache, muscle
aches, and shortness of breath. As early as one day after
these initial symptoms appear, and as long as two weeks
later, the symptoms suddenly worsen and progress to
bronchitis. The patient experiences difficulty breathing, and finally, the patient enters a state of shock.
This rare form of anthrax is often fatal, even if treated
within one or two days after the symptoms appear.
Intestinal anthrax
Intestinal anthrax is a rare, often-fatal form of the
disease, caused by eating meat from an animal that
died of anthrax. Intestinal anthrax causes stomach
and intestinal inflammation and sores or lesions
(ulcers), much like the sores that appear on the skin
in the cutaneous form of anthrax. The first signs of the
disease are nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, and
fever, followed by abdominal pain, vomiting of blood,
and severe bloody diarrhea.

Diagnosis
Anthrax is diagnosed by detecting B. anthracis in
samples taken from blood, spinal fluid, skin lesions, or
respiratory secretions. The bacteria may be positively
identified using biochemical methods or using a technique whereby, if present in the sample, the anthrax
bacterium is made to fluoresce. Blood samples will
also indicate elevated antibody levels or increased
amounts of a protein produced directly in response
to infection with the anthrax bacterium. Polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) tests amplify trace amounts of
DNA to show that the anthrax bacteria are present.
Additional DNA-based tests are also currently being
perfected.

Treatment
In the early stages, anthrax is curable by administering high doses of antibiotics, but in the advanced
stages, it can be fatal. If anthrax is suspected, health
care professionals may begin to treat the patient with
antibiotics even before the diagnosis is confirmed
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

because early intervention is essential. The antibiotics
used include penicillin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin. Because inhaled spores can remain in the body for
a long time, antibiotic treatment for inhalation
anthrax should continue for 60 days. In the case of
cutaneous anthrax, the infection may be cured following a single dose of antibiotic, but it is important to
continue treatment so as to avoid potential serious
complications, such as inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).
In the setting of potential bioterrorism, cutaneous
anthrax should be treated with a 60-day dose of
antibiotics.
Research is ongoing to develop new antibiotics
and antitoxins that would work against the anthrax
bacteria and the toxins they produce. One Harvard
professor, Dr. R. John Collier, and his team have been
testing two possible antitoxins on rats. A Stanford
microbiologist and a Penn State chemist have also
been testing their new antibiotic against the bacteria
that cause brucellosis and tularemia, as well as
the bacteria that cause anthrax. All of these drugs
are still in early investigational stages, however, and
it is still unknown how these drugs would affect
humans.

Prognosis
Untreated anthrax is often fatal, but death is far
less likely with appropriate care. Ten to twenty percent of patients will die from anthrax of the skin
(cutaneous anthrax) if it is not properly treated. All
patients with inhalation (pulmonary) anthrax will
die if untreated. Intestinal anthrax is fatal 25-75%
of the time.

Prevention
Anthrax is relatively rare in the United States
because of widespread animal vaccination and practices used to disinfect hides or other animal products.
Anyone visiting a country where anthrax is common
or where herd animals are not often vaccinated should
avoid contact with livestock or animal products and
avoid eating meat that has not been properly prepared
and cooked.
Other means of preventing the spread of infection
include carefully handling dead animals suspected of
having the disease, burning (instead of burying) contaminated carcasses, and providing good ventilation
when processing hides, fur, wool, or hair.
In the event that exposure to anthrax spores is
known, such as in the aftermath of a terrorist attack,
239

Anthrax

remain within the sore. If, however, they spread to the
nearest lymph node (or, in rare cases, escape into the
bloodstream), the bacteria can cause a form of blood
poisoning that rapidly proves fatal.

Antiacne drugs

a course of antibiotics can prevent the disease from
occurring.
In the case of contaminated mail, as was the case in
the 2001 attacks, the U.S. postal service recommends
certain precautions. These precautions include
inspecting mail from an unknown sender for excessive
tape, powder, uneven weight or lumpy spots, restrictive
endorsements such as ‘‘Personal,’’ or ‘‘Confidential,’’ a
postmark different from the sender’s address, or a
sender’s address that seems false or that cannot be
verified. Handwashing is also recommended after
handling mail. In order to decontaminate batches of
mail before being opened, machines that use bacteriakilling radiation could be used to sterilize the mail.
These machines are similar to systems already in place
on assembly lines for sterile products, such as bandages
and medical devices, but this technique would not be
practical for large quantities of mail. In addition, the
radiation could damage some of the mail’s contents,
such as undeveloped photographic film. Microwave
radiation or the heat from a clothes iron is not powerful
enough to kill the anthrax bacteria.
For those in high-risk professions, an anthrax
vaccine is available that is 93% effective in protecting
against infection. To provide this immunity, an individual should be given an initial course of three injections, given two weeks apart, followed by booster
injections at six, 12, and 18 months and an annual
immunization thereafter.
Approximately 30% of those who have been
vaccinated against anthrax may notice mild local reactions, such as tenderness at the injection site.
Infrequently, there may be a severe local reaction
with extensive swelling of the forearm, and a few
vaccine recipients may have a more general flu-like
reaction to the shot, including muscle and joint
aches, headache, and fatigue. Reactions requiring hospitalization are very rare. However, this vaccine is only
available to people who are at high risk, including
veterinary and laboratory workers, livestock handlers,
and military personnel. The vaccine is not recommended for people who have previously recovered
from an anthrax infection or for pregnant women.
Whether this vaccine would protect against anthrax
used as a biological weapon is, as yet, unclear.

I Antiacne drugs
Definition
Antiacne drugs are medicines that help clear up
pimples, blackheads, whiteheads, and more severe
forms of acne.

Purpose
Different types of antiacne drugs are used for
different purposes. For example, lotions, soaps, gels,
and creams containing benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin
may be used to clear up mild to moderately severe
acne. Isotretinoin (Accutane) is prescribed only for
very severe, disfiguring acne.
Acne is a skin condition that occurs when pores or
hair follicles become blocked. This blockage allows a
waxy material called sebum to collect inside the pores
or follicles. Normally, sebum flows out onto the skin
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Brand Name (Generic Name)
Accutane (isotretinoin)
Benzamycin
Cleocin T(clindamycin

Desquam-E(benzoyl peroxide)
Erythromycin topical (A/T/S,

Minocin (minocycline
hydrochloride)
Retin-A (tretinoin)

Possible Common Side Effects
Include:
Dry skin, dry mouth, conjunctivitis
Dry and itchy skin

Itching, red and peeling skin
Burning, dry skin, hives, red and
peeling skin
Headache, hives, diarrhea, peeling

Darkening of the skin, blistering,
crusted, or puffy skin

and hair to form a protective coating, but when it
cannot get out, small swellings develop on the skin
surface. Bacteria and dead skin cells can also collect
that can cause inflammation. Swellings that are small
and not inflamed are whiteheads or blackheads. When
they become inflamed, they turn into pimples. Pimples
that fill with pus are called pustules.
The severity of acne is often influenced by seasonal changes; it is typically less severe in summer than in
winter. In addition, acne in girls is often affected by the
menstrual cycle.
Acne cannot be cured, but acne drugs can help
clear the skin. Benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin work
by mildly irritating the skin. This encourages skin
cells to slough off, which helps open blocked pores.
Benzoyl peroxide also kills bacteria, which helps prevent whiteheads and blackheads from turning into
pimples. Isotretinoin shrinks the glands that produce
sebum.

Description
Benzoyl peroxide is found in many over-the-counter
acne products that are applied to the skin, such
as Benoxyl, Clear By Design, Neutrogena Acne,
PanOxyl, and some formulations of Clean & Clear,
Clearasil, and Oxy. Some benzoyl peroxide products
are available without a physician’s prescription; others
require a prescription. Tretinoin (Retin-A) is available
only with a physician’s prescription and comes in
liquid, cream, and gel forms, which are applied to the
skin. Isotretinoin (Accutane), which is taken by mouth
in capsule form, is available only with a physician’s
prescription. Only physicians who have experience
in diagnosing and treating severe acne, such as dermatologists, should prescribe isotretinoin.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Acne—A skin condition in which raised bumps,
pimples, and cysts form on the face, neck,
shoulders and upper back.
Bacteria—Tiny, one-celled forms of life that cause
many diseases and infections.
Bowel—The intestine; a tube-like structure that
extends from the stomach to the anus. Some digestive processes are carried out in the bowel before
food passes out of the body as waste.
Cyst—An abnormal sac or enclosed cavity in the
body, filled with liquid or partially solid material.
Dermatologist—A doctor who specializes in treating diseases and disorders of the skin.
Eczema—Inflammation of the skin with itching and
a rash. The rash may have blisters that ooze and
form crusts.
Pimple—A small, red swelling of the skin.
Psoriasis—A skin disease in which people have
itchy, scaly, red patches on the skin.
Pus—Thick, whitish or yellowish fluid that forms in
infected tissue.
Triglyceride—A substance formed in the body from
fat in the diet.

Some newer antiacne preparations combine
benzoyl peroxide with antibiotics. One combination
of benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin is sold under
the trade name BenzaClin.
Many antiacne preparations contain compounds
derived from plants that have anti-inflammatory
properties. One group of researchers listed thirtyeight different plants that are beneficial in treating
acne and other inflammatory skin conditions.

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
antiacne drug. These drugs usually come with written
directions for patients and should be used only as
directed. Patients who have questions about how to
use the medicine should check with a physician or
pharmacist.
Patients who use isotretinoin usually take the
medicine for a few months, then stop for at least two
months. Their acne may continue to improve even

after they stop taking the medicine. If the condition is
still severe after several months of treatment and a
two-month break, the physician may prescribe a
second course of treatment.

Precautions
Isotretinoin
Isotretinoin can cause serious birth defects, including mental retardation and physical deformities. This
medicine should not be used during pregnancy.
Women who are able to bear children should not use
isotretinoin unless they have very severe acne that has
not cleared up with the use of other antiacne drugs. In
that case, a woman who uses this drug must have a
pregnancy test two weeks before beginning treatment
and each month they are taking the drug. Another
pregnancy test must be done one month after treatment ends. The woman must use an effective birth
control method for one month before treatment begins
and must continue using it throughout treatment and
for one month after treatment ends. Women who are
able to bear children and who want to use this medicine should discuss this information with their health
care providers. Before using the medicine, they will
be asked to sign a consent form stating that they
understand the danger of taking isotretinoin during
pregnancy and that they agree to use effective birth
control.
Do not donate blood to a blood bank while taking
isotretinoin or for 30 days after treatment with the
drug ends. This will help reduce the chance of a pregnant woman receiving blood containing isotretinoin,
which could cause birth defects.
Isotretinoin may cause a sudden decrease in night
vision. If this happens, do not drive or do anything else
that could be dangerous until vision returns to normal.
Let the physician know about the problem.
This medicine may also make the eyes, nose, and
mouth dry. Ask the physician about using special eye
drops to relieve eye dryness. To temporarily relieve
the dry mouth, chew sugarless gum, suck on sugarless
candy or ice chips, or use saliva substitutes, which
come in liquid and tablet forms and are available
without a prescription. If the problem continues for
more than two weeks, check with a physician or
dentist. Mouth dryness that continues over a long
time may contribute to tooth decay and other dental
problems.
Isotretinoin may increase sensitivity to sunlight.
Patients being treated with this medicine should avoid
exposure to the sun and should not use tanning beds,
242

tanning booths, or sunlamps until they know how the
drug affects them.
In the early stages of treatment with isotretinoin,
some people’s acne seems to get worse before it starts
getting better. If the condition becomes much worse or
if the skin is very irritated, check with the physician
who prescribed the medicine.
Benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin
When applying antiacne drugs to the skin, be
careful not to get the medicine in the eyes, mouth, or
inside of the nose. Do not put the medicine on skin
that is wind burned, sunburned, or irritated, and do
not apply it to open wounds.
Because such antiacne drugs as benzoyl peroxide
and tretinoin irritate the skin slightly, avoid doing
anything that might cause further irritation. Wash
the face with mild soap and water only two or three
times a day, unless the physician says to wash it more
often. Avoid using abrasive soaps or cleansers and
products that might dry the skin or make it peel,
such as medicated cosmetics, cleansers that contain
alcohol, or other acne products that contain resorcinol, sulfur or salicylic acid.
If benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin make the skin too
red or too dry or cause too much peeling, check with a
physician. Using the medicine less often or using a
weaker strength may be necessary.
Tretinoin may increase sensitivity to sunlight.
While being treated with this medicine, avoid exposure
to the sun and do not use tanning beds, tanning
booths, or sunlamps. If it is not possible to avoid
being in the sun, use a sunscreen with a skin protection
factor (SPF) of at least 15 or wear protective clothing
over the treated areas. The skin may also become
more sensitive to cold and wind. People who use this
medicine should protect their skin from cold and wind
until they know how the medicine affects them.
Benzoyl peroxide may discolor hair or colored
fabrics.
Special conditions
People who have certain medical conditions or
who are taking certain other medicines may have problems if they use antiacne drugs. Before using these
products, be sure to let the physician know about any
of these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to etretinate, isotretinoin, tretinoin, vitamin A preparations, or benzoyl peroxide in the past should let his or

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

PREGNANCY. Women who are pregnant or who

may become pregnant should check with a physician
before using tretinoin or benzoyl peroxide. Isotretinoin
causes birth defects in humans and must not be used
during pregnancy.
BREASTFEEDING. No problems have been reported

in nursing babies whose mothers used tretinoin or
benzoyl peroxide. Women who are breastfeeding
babies should not take isotretinoin, however, as it
may cause problems in nursing babies.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using anti-

acne drugs applied to the skin, people with any of these
medical problems should make sure their physicians
are aware of their conditions:


eczema. Antiacne drugs that are applied to the skin
may make this condition worse.



sunburn or raw skin. Antiacne drugs that are applied
to the skin may increase the pain and irritation of
these conditions.

In people with certain medical conditions, isotretinoin may increase the amount of triglyceride
(a fatty-substance) in the blood. This may lead to
heart or blood vessel problems. Before using isotretinoin, people with any of these medical problems
should make sure their physicians are aware of their
conditions:


alcoholism or heavy drinking, now or in the past



diabetes (or family history of diabetes). Isotretinoin
may also change blood sugar levels.



family history of high triglyceride levels in the blood



severe weight problems.

USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Using antiacne drugs
with certain other drugs may affect the way the drugs
work or may increase the chance of side effects.

Side effects
Isotretinoin
Minor discomforts such as dry mouth or nose,
dry eyes, dry skin, or itching usually go away as the
body adjusts to the drug and do not require medical
attention unless they continue or are bothersome.
Other side effects should be brought to a physicians attention. These include:


burning, redness, or itching of the eyes



nosebleeds

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



signs of inflammation of the lips, such as peeling,
burning, redness or pain

Bowel inflammation is not a common side effect,
but it may occur. If any of the following signs of bowel
inflammation occur, stop taking isotretinoin immediately and check with a physician:


pain in the abdomen



bleeding from the rectum



severe diarrhea
Benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin

The most common side effects of antiacne drugs
applied to the skin are slight redness, dryness, peeling,
and stinging, and a warm feeling to the skin. These
problems usually go away as the body adjusts to the
drug and do not require medical treatment.
Other side effects should be brought to a physician’s attention. Check with a physician as soon as
possible if any of the following side effects occur:


blistering, crusting or swelling of the skin



severe burning or redness of the skin



darkening or lightening of the skin. (This effect will
eventually go away after treatment with an antiacne
drug ends.)



skin rash

Other side effects are possible with any type of
antiacne drug. Anyone who has unusual symptoms
while using antiacne drugs should get in touch with
his or her physician.

Interactions
Patients using antiacne drugs on their skin should
tell their physicians if they are using any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine that they apply to the skin in the same area.
Isotretinoin may interact with other medicines.
When this happens, the effects of one or both drugs
may change or the risk of side effects may be greater.
Anyone who takes isotretinoin should let the physician know about all other medicines he or she is taking
and should ask whether the possible interactions can
interfere with drug therapy. Among the drugs that
may interact with isotretinoin are:


etretinate (Tegison), used to treat severe psoriasis.
Using this medicine with isotretinoin increases side
effects.



tretinoin (Retin-A, Renova). Using this medicine
with isotretinoin increases side effects.
243

Antiacne drugs

her physician know before using an antiacne drug. The
physician should also be told about any allergies to
foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.

Antiandrogen drugs



vitamin A or any medicine containing vitamin A.
Using any vitamin A preparations with isotretinoin
increases side effects. Do not take vitamin supplements containing vitamin A while taking isotretinoin.



tetracyclines (used to treat infections). Using these
medicines with isotretinoin increases the chance of
swelling of the brain. Make sure the physician knows
if tetracycline is being used to treat acne or another
infection.

Definition
Antiandrogen drugs are a diverse group of medications given to counteract the effects of androgens
(male sex hormones) on various body organs and
tissues. Some medications in this category work by
lowering the body’s production of androgens while
others work by blocking the body’s ability to make
use of the androgens that are produced. The first
group of antiandrogens includes such medications as
leuprolide (Lupron, Viadur, or Eligard), goserelin
(Zoladex), triptorelin (Trelstar Depot), and abarelix
(Plenaxis). The second group includes flutamide
(Eulexin), nilutamide (Nilandron), cyproterone acetate (Cyprostat, Androcur, Cyproterone), and bicalutamide (Casodex). Flutamide, nilutamide, and
bicalutamide are nonsteroidal antiandrogen drugs
while cyproterone acetate is a steroidal medication.
Some drugs that were originally developed to treat
other conditions are sometimes categorized as antiandrogens because their off-label uses include some of
the disorders listed below. These drugs include
medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera), a derivative of
the female sex hormone progesterone that is used as a
contraceptive and treatment for abnormal uterine
bleeding; ketoconazole (Nizoral), an antifungal drug;
and spironolactone (Aldactone), a diuretic.

Purpose
Antiandrogen drugs may be given for any of
several conditions or disorders, ranging from skin
problems to mental disorders:


Prostate cancer. Antiandrogen medications may be
used to treat both early-stage and advanced prostate
cancer by lowering or blocking the supply of male sex
hormones that encourage the growth and spread of
the cancer.



Androgenetic alopecia. Androgenetic alopecia is a
type of hair loss that is genetically determined and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



Acne. Acne is the end result of several factors, one of
which is excessive production of sebum, a whitish
semiliquid greasy substance produced by certain
glands in the skin. Antiandrogens may help to clear
acne by slowing down the secretion of sebum, which
depends on androgen production.



Amenorrhea. Amenorrhea, or the absence of menstrual periods in females of childbearing age, is sometimes caused by excessively high levels of androgens
in the blood. Antiandrogen medications may help to
restore normal menstrual periods.



Hirsutism. Hirsutism is a condition in which women
develop excessive facial and body hair in a distribution pattern usually associated with adult males.
It results from abnormally high levels of androgens
in the bloodstream or from increased sensitivity of
the hair follicles to normal levels of androgens.
Hirsutism may be a sign of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition in which the ovaries
develop multiple large cysts and produce too
much androgen.



Gender reassignment. Antiandrogen drugs are often
prescribed for male-to-female (MTF) transsexuals as
part of the hormonal treatment that precedes gender
reassignment surgery.



Paraphilias. Paraphilias are a group of mental disorders characterized by intense and recurrent sexual
urges or behaviors involving nonhuman objects, children or nonconsenting adults, or pain and humiliation. Antiandrogen drugs have been prescribed for
men diagnosed with paraphilias in order to lower
blood serum levels of testosterone and help them
control their sexual urges.



Virilization. Virilization is an extreme form of hyperandrogenism in females, marked by such changes
as development of male pattern baldness, voice
changes, and overdevelopment of the skeletal muscles. Antiandrogens may be given to correct this
condition.

under investigation as a possible treatment for
the paraphilias.


Goserelin. Goserelin is also an LHRH agonist, and
works in the same way as leuprolide.



Triptorelin. Triptorelin is an LHRH agonist, and
works in the same way as leuprolide. It is not usually

Leuprolide. Leuprolide is classified as a luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist,
which means that it resembles a chemical produced
by the hypothalamus (a gland located in the brain)
that lowers the level of testosterone in the bloodstream. It also reduces levels of estrogen in girls
and women, and may be used to treat endometriosis or tumors in the uterus. It is presently

Leuprolide. Leuprolide is available in an injectable
form and as an implant. The implant form, used to
treat prostate cancer, contains 22.5 mg of leuprolide
and is inserted under the skin every three months.
This type of slow-release medication is called depot
form. A longer-acting implant that lasts 12 months
is also available. Injectable leuprolide is injected
once a day in a 1-mg dose to treat prostate cancer.
The dosage for endometriosis or uterine tumors is
3.75 mg injected into a muscle once a month for three
to six months.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Definition
Antianemia drugs are therapeutic agents which
increase either the number of red cells or the amount
of hemoglobin in the blood.

Purpose
Anemia is a general term for a large number of
conditions marked by a reduction in the oxygencarrying capacity of blood. Red blood cells carry
oxygen in hemoglobin, so that anemia may be caused
by a deficiency of blood or red blood cells or of hemoglobin. These conditions may be caused by a variety
of other conditions. Injury can cause blood loss, which
in turn can cause anemia. Nutritional deficiency,
inadequate amounts of some of the vitamins and
minerals that are needed for hemoglobin production,
may also cause anemia. Because hemoglobin is the
pigment that makes blood cells red, a lack of hemoglobin will cause the cells to be a paler color, leading
to the term hypochromic, lacking in color.
Other conditions can also cause anemia. For
example, certain diseases cause the condition. These
can include infections and kidney disease, in which
there is a deficiency of erythropoietin, a material produced in the kidneys which is essential for the production of red blood cells. Certain genetic conditions
affect the absorption of nutrients and may lead to
anemia. In sickle cell anemia, a genetic condition in
which the red cells are curved rather than flat, the red
cells have reduced ability to carry oxygen.
The Merck Manual reduces all types of anemia to
three classes:


blood loss



inadequate production of blood



excessive breakdown of blood cells

Anemia may be caused by one or a combination
of these three factors. Drug therapy is available for
many types of anemia; however, the selection of the
drug depends on proper diagnosis of the cause of the
anemia.

Description
Anemia caused by blood loss is normally treated
with either blood volume expanders such as plasma or
with related blood products. More severe blood loss
may require transfusions of red blood cells.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS
Anabolic steroid—Drugs, derived from the male
sex hormones, which increase the rate of tissue
growth. They are best known for increasing the
rate of muscle development.
Anemia—Any condition in which the amount of
hemoglobin in red cells, the number of red cells,
or the size of the red cells in blood is reduced from
the normal.
Crohn’s disease—Chronic inflammation of the
intestine.
Hemochromatosis—A disorder of iron metabolism
characterized by excessive absorption of iron from
food.
Hemoglobin—The red protein found in blood cells
which carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues.
Hemolytic anemia—A type of anemia marked by
the breakdown of red blood cells causing the
release of hemoglobin.
Sickle cell anemia—An inherited condition,
marked by crescent-shaped red blood cells and
red cell breakdown.

In some cases, blood loss may be due to ulcers of
the stomach or intestines. In these cases, treatment of
the underlying cause will normally correct the anemia.
Iron deficiency
The most common cause of anemia in adults is
iron deficiency. Although the typical American diet
contains enough iron to meet normal needs, individuals
who are less able to absorb and store iron may experience inadequate hemoglobin production. Although the
best way to meet daily iron requirements is through
improved diet, iron supplements are widely used.
Iron is normally taken in the form of ferrous
sulfate. Although other iron salts are commercially
available and make claims of fewer or less severe side
effects, these benefits may be related to the fact that
other preparations contain less iron by weight.
Ferrous sulfate contains about 37% iron, while ferrous gluconate contains only about 13% iron. People
who have trouble with the side effects of ferrous
sulfate may benefit from some of the specialty preparations available, but ferrous sulfate normally
offers the greatest amount of iron of all commercial
products.

Antianemia drugs

I Antianemia drugs

Antianemia drugs

Recommended dosage
Dosage should be calculated by iron needs, based
on laboratory tests. Manufacturers recommend one
tablet a day, containing 65 mg of iron, as a supplement
for patients over the age of 12 years.

Precautions
Iron can lead to lethal poisoning in children. All
iron supplements should be kept carefully out of reach
of children.
Some types of anemia do not respond to iron
therapy, and the use of iron should be avoided in
these cases. People with acquired hemolytic anemia,
autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hemochromatosis,
hemolytic anemia and hemosiderosis should not take
iron supplements. Hemolytic anemia is caused by
the increased breakdown of red blood cells.
Hemochromatosis and hemosiderosis and are conditions in which there is too much, rather than too little,
absorption of iron.
Iron supplements should also be avoided by people who have gastric or intestinal ulcers, ulcerative
colitis, or Crohn’s disease. These conditions marked
by inflammation of the digestive tract, which would be
made worse by use of iron.

Side effects
The most common side effects of iron consumption are stomach and intestinal problems, including
stomach upset with cramps, constipation, diarrhea,
nausea, and vomiting. At least 25% of patients have
one or more of these side effects. The frequency and
severity of the side effects increases with the dose of
iron. Less frequent side effects include heartburn and
urine discoloration.

Interactions
Iron supplements should not be taken at the same
time as antibiotics of either the tetracycline or quinolone types. The iron will reduce the effectiveness of the
antibiotic. Also, iron supplements reduces the effectiveness of levodopa, which is used in treatment of
Parkinson’s disease.
Iron supplements should not be used with magnesium trisilicate, an antacid, or with penicillamine,
which is used for some types of arthritis.
Taking iron with vitamin C increases the absorption of iron, with no increase in side effects.
250

Folic acid
Folic acid is found in many common foods,
including liver, dried peas, lentils, oranges, wholewheat products, asparagus, beets, broccoli, brussel
sprouts, and spinach. However, in some cases, patients
have difficulty absorbing folic acid or in converting it
from the form found in foods to the form that is active
in blood formation. In these cases, folic acid tablets are
appropriate for use.
RECOMMENDED DOSAGE. For treatment of anemia, a daily dose of 1 mg is generally used. Patients
who have trouble absorbing folic acid may require
higher doses.

Maintenance doses are:


infants: 0.1 mg/day



children (under 4 years of age): up to 0.3 mg/day



children (over 4 years of age) and adults: 0.4 mg/day



pregnant and lactating women: 0.8 mg/day

PRECAUTIONS. Before treating an anemia with
folic acid, diagnostic tests must be performed to verify
the cause of the anemia. Pernicious anemia caused by
lack of vitamin B12 shows symptoms that are very
similar to those of folic acid deficiency but also causes
nerve damage which shows up as a tingling sensation
and feelings of numbness. Giving folic acid to patients
with B12 deficiency anemia improves the blood cell
count, but the nerve damage continues to progress.
SIDE EFFECTS. Folic acid is considered extremely
safe, and there are no predictable side effects. Where
side effects have been reported, they have been among
patients taking many times more than the normal
therapeutic dose of the drug.

On rare occasions allergic reactions to folic acid
have been reported.
INTERACTIONS. Phenytoins, used to treat seizure
disorders, interact with folic acid with a reduction in
phenytoin effectiveness and an increased risk of
seizures. If the two drugs must be used together, phenytoin blood levels should be monitored, and the dose
may have to be increased.

Trimethoprim (an antibacterial) and methotrexate (originally an anti-cancer drug, which is also used
for arthritis and psoriasis) act by reducing the metabolism of folic acid. Regular blood monitoring is
required, and dose adjustments may be needed.
Vitamin B12
Vitamin B12 is also known as cyanocobalamine
and hydroxocobalamine. Cyanocobalamine may be
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

RECOMMENDED DOSAGE. While vitamin B12 can

be given by mouth for mild vitamin deficiency states,
pernicious anemia should always be treated with injections, either under the skin (subcutaneous) or into
muscle (intramuscular). Hydroxocobalamine should
only be injected into muscle. Intravenous injections
are not used because the vitamin is eliminated from
the body too quickly when given this way. Elderly
patients, whose ability to absorb vitamin B12 through
the stomach may be impaired, should also be treated
with injections only.
The normal dose of cyanocobalamine is 100 mcg
(micrograms) daily for six to seven days. If improvement is seen, the dose may be reduced to 100 mcg every
other day for seven doses and then 100 mcg every three
to four days for two to three weeks. After that,
monthly injections may be required for life.

Anabolic steroids
The anabolic steroids (nandrolone, oxymetholone, oxandrolone, and stanzolol) are the same drugs
that are used improperly by body builders to increase
muscle mass. Two of these drugs, nandrolone and
oxymetholone, are approved for use in treatment of
anemia. Nandrolone is indicated for treatment of anemia caused by kidney failure, while oxymetholone
may be used to treat anemia caused by insufficient
red cell production, such as aplastic anemia.
All anabolic steroids are considered to be drugs of
abuse under United States federal law.
RECOMMENDED DOSAGE. The information that
follows is specific only to oxymetholone; however,
the warnings and precautions apply to all drugs in
the class of anabolic steroids.

The dosage of oxymetholone must be individualized. The most common dose is 1 to 2 mg per kilogram
of body weight per day, although doses as high as 5 mg
per kilogram per day have been used. The response to
these drugs is slow, and it may take several months to
see if there is any benefit.
PRECAUTIONS. All anabolic steroids are dangerous. The following warnings represent the most
significant hazards of these drugs. For a complete
list, patients should consult the manufacturer’s package insert.


Peliosis hepatitis, a condition in which liver and
sometimes spleen tissue is replaced with blood-filled
cysts, has occurred in patients receiving androgenic
anabolic steroids. Although this condition is usually
reversible by discontinuing the drug, if it is left undetected and untreated, it may lead to life-threatening
liver failure or bleeding.



Liver tumors may develop. Although most of these
tumors are benign and will go away when the drug is
discontinued, liver cancers may also result.



Anabolic steroids may cause changes in blood lipids,
leading to atherosclerosis with greatly increased risk
of heart attack.



Because anabolic steroids are derived from male sex
hormones, masculinization may occur when they are
used by women.



Elderly men who use these drugs may be at increased
risk of prostate enlargement and prostate cancer.



Increased water retention due to anabolic steroids
may lead to heart failure.



Anabolic steroids should not be used during
pregnancy, since this may cause masculinization of
the fetus.

PRECAUTIONS. Although vitamin B12 has a very
high level of safety, commercial preparations may
contain preservatives which may cause allergic
responses.

In patients with pernicious anemia, treatment
with vitamin B12 may lead to loss of potassium.
Patients should be monitored for their potassium
levels.
SIDE EFFECTS. Diarrhea and itching of the skin

have been reported on rare occasions. Moreover,
there have been reports of severe allergic reactions to
cyanocobalamine.
INTERACTIONS. Aminosalicylic acid may reduce
the effectiveness of vitamin B12. Also, colchicine, a
drug used for gout, may reduce the effectiveness
of vitamin B12. Other, infrequently used drugs and
excessive use of alcohol may also affect the efficacy
of vitamin B12. Patients being treated for anemia
should discuss all medications, both prescription
and nonprescription, with their physician or
pharmacist.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

251

Antianemia drugs

given by mouth, while hydroxocobalamine must be
injected. The vitamin has many functions in the
body, including maintaining the nervous system, but
in treatment of anemia B12 is needed for the metabolism of folic acid. Lack of B12 causes pernicious anemia, a type of anemia which is marked by a low red cell
count and lack of hemoglobin. There are many other
symptoms of pernicious anemia, including a feeling of
tingling or numbness, shortness of breath, muscle
weakness, faintness, and a smooth tongue. If pernicious anemia is left untreated for more than three
months, permanent damage to the nerves of the spinal
cord may result.

Antianemia drugs



Anabolic steroids should be used in children only if
there is no possible alternative. These drugs may
cause the long bones of the legs to stop growing
prematurely, leading to reduction in adult height.
Regular monitoring is essential.



In patients with epilepsy, the frequency of seizures
may be increased.



In patients with diabetes, glucose tolerance may be
altered. Careful monitoring is essential.

SIDE EFFECTS. The list of side effects associated
with anabolic steroids is extremely long. The following
list covers only the most commonly observed effects:


acne



increased urinary frequency



breast growth in males



breast pain



persistent, painful erections



masculinization in women

INTERACTIONS. Anabolic steroids should not be
used in combination with anticoagulants such as warfarin. Anabolic steroids increase the effects of the
anticoagulant, possibly leading to bleeding. If the
combination cannot be avoided, careful monitoring
is essential.

Epoetin alfa
Epoetin alfa is a synthetic form of a protein produced by the kidneys that stimulates the production
and release of red blood cells. A similar drug, darepoetin alpha, is available with the same properties, but
it remains active longer and so requires fewer injections each week. Because epoetin alfa is approved for
more types of anemia than darepoetin, this discussion
deals only with the older drug.
Epoetin alpha is approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for the following uses:


anemia associated with chronic renal failure



anemia related to zidovudine therapy in HIVinfected patients



anemia in cancer patients on chemotherapy



reduction in blood transfusions in surgical patients

In addition, epoetin alpha may be useful in anemia from many other causes. These include but are not
limited to anemia of prematurity, sickle cell anemia,
and the anemia associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
The drug has been abused by athletes due to the
theory that increasing the red blood cell count
improves athletic performance. The potential benefits
252

of misuse of the drug are limited, and the risks are
significant. The United States and International
Olympic Committees and the National Collegiate
Athletic Association consider the use of epoetin alfa
to enhance athletic ergogenic potential inappropriate
and unacceptable because its use by athletes is contrary to the rules and ethical principles of athletic
competition. As of the early 200s, tests to detect the
misuse of epoetin alfa by athletes are increasingly
reliable.
RECOMMENDED DOSAGE. Dosing schedules may
vary with the cause of the anemia. All doses should
be individualized. In general, epoetin alpha dosing
in adults is started at 50 to 100 units per kilogram
given three times a week, either by vein or subcutaneously.

The dose should be reduced if the hemoglobin
level reaches 12 grams per decaliter or if the hemoglobin level increases by more than 1 gram per decaliter in
any two-week period. The drug should be interrupted
if hemoglobin levels reach 13 grams or more per
decaliter.
The dose should be increased if the hemoglobin
level does not increase by at least 2 grams per decaliter
after eight weeks of treatment.
Maintenance doses, if required, should be individualized to keep the hemoglobin levels within the
range of 10 to 12 grams per decaliter.
PRECAUTIONS. Epoetin alpha should not be given
to patients with severe, uncontrolled hypertension.

Other conditions in which epoetin alpha should be
used only when the benefits clearly outweigh the risks
are as follows:

constitutional aplastic anemia

I Antiangina drugs
Definition
Antiangina drugs are medicines that relieve the
symptoms of angina pectoris (severe chest pain).

Purpose
The dull, tight chest pain of angina occurs when the
heart’s muscular wall is not getting enough oxygen. By
relaxing the blood vessels, antiangina drugs reduce the
heart’s work load and increase the amount of oxygenrich blood that reaches the heart. These drugs come in
different forms, and are used in three main ways:


taken regularly over a long period, they reduce the
number of angina attacks.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



taken just before some activity that usually brings on
an attack, such as climbing stairs, they prevent attacks.



taken when an attack begins, they relieve the pain
and pressure.

Not every form of antiangina drug can be used in
every way. Some work too slowly to prevent attacks
that are about to begin or to relieve attacks that have
already started. These forms can be used only to
reduce the number of attacks. Be sure to understand
how and when to use the type of antiangina drug that
has been prescribed.

Description
Antiangina drugs, also known as nitrates, come in
many different forms: tablets and capsules that are
swallowed; tablets that are held under the tongue,
inside the lip, or in the cheek until they dissolve;
stick-on patches; ointment; and in-the-mouth sprays.
Commonly used antiangina drugs include isosorbide
dinitrate (Isordil, Sorbitrate, and other brands) and
nitroglycerin (Nitro-Bid, Nitro-Dur, Nitrolingual
Spray, Nitrostat Tablets, Transderm-Nitro, and
other brands). These medicines are available only
with a physician’s prescription.

Antiangina drugs

KEY TERMS
Angina pectoris—A feeling of tightness, heaviness,
or pain in the chest, caused by a lack of oxygen in
the muscular wall of the heart.

Recommended dosage

relieved within three doses taken about 5 minutes
apart, the person should go to the hospital emergency
room as soon as possible. A heart attack may be in
progress.
Some people develop tolerance to antiangina
drugs over time. That is, the drug no longer produces
the desired effects. Anyone who seems to be developing a tolerance to this medicine should check with his
or her physician.

The recommended dosage depends on the type
and form of antiangina drug and may be different
for different patients. Check with the physician who
prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the
prescription for the correct dosage.

Anyone who has had unusual reactions to antiangina drugs in the past should let his or her physician
know before taking the drugs again. The physician
should also be told about any allergies to foods,
dyes, preservatives, or other substances.

Always take antiangina drugs exactly as directed.
The medicine will not work if it is not taken correctly.

Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who
may become pregnant should check with their physicians before using antiangina drugs.

Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly after
taking it for several weeks or more, as this could cause
angina attacks to return. If it is necessary to stop taking
the drug, check with the physician who prescribed it
for instructions on how to taper down gradually.

Precautions
Remember that some forms of antiangina drugs
work too slowly to relieve attacks that have already
started. Check with the physician who prescribed the
medicine for instructions on how to use the type that
has been prescribed. Patients who are using sloweracting forms to make attacks less frequent may want
to ask their physicians to prescribe a fast-acting type to
relieve attacks. Another method of treating the frequency of attacks is to increase the dosage of the longacting antiangina drug. Do this only with the approval
of a physician.
These medicines make some people feel lightheaded, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting
or lying down. To lessen the problem, get up gradually
and hold onto something for support if possible.
Antiangina drugs may also cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting in hot weather or when people stand
for a long time or exercise. Use caution in all these
situations. Drinking alcohol while taking antiangina
drugs may cause the same problems. Anyone who
takes this medicine should limit the amount of alcohol
consumed.
Because these drugs may cause dizziness, be careful when driving, using machines, or doing anything
else that could be dangerous.
If the person is taking the form of nitroglycerin
that is placed under the tongue and symptoms are not
254

Older people may be especially sensitive to the
effects of antiangina drugs and thus more likely to
have side effects such as dizziness and lightheadedness.
Before using antiangina drugs, people with any of
these medical problems should make sure their physicians are aware of their conditions:


recent heart attack or stroke



kidney disease



liver disease



severe anemia



overactive thyroid



glaucoma



recent head injury

Side effects
A common side effect is a headache just after
taking a dose of the medicine. These headaches usually
become less noticeable as the body adjusts to the drug.
Check with a physician if they are severe or they continue even after taking the medicine for a few weeks.
Unless a physician says to do so, do not change the
dose to avoid headaches. Other common side effects
include dizziness, lightheadedness, fast pulse, flushed
face and neck, nausea or vomiting, and restlessness.
These problems do not need medical attention unless
they do not go away or they interfere with normal
activities.
Other side effects may occur. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after taking an antiangina drug
should get in touch with his or her physician.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Antiangina drugs may interact with other medicines. This may increase the risk of side effects or
change the effects of one or both drugs. Anyone who
takes antiangina drugs should let the physician know
all other medicines he or she is taking. Among the
drugs that may interact with antiangina drugs are:

other heart medicines

I Antiangiogenic therapy
Definition
Antiangiogenesis therapy is one of two types of
drugs in a new class of medicines that restores health
by controlling blood vessel growth. The other medication is called pro-angiogenic therapy.

Purpose
Antiangiogenic therapy inhibits the growth of new
blood vessels. Because new blood vessel growth plays a
critical role in many disease conditions, including
disorders that cause blindness, arthritis, and
cancer, angiogenesis inhibition is a ‘‘common denominator’’ approach to treating these diseases. Antiangiogenic
drugs exert their beneficial effects in a number of ways: by
disabling the agents that activate and promote cell
growth, or by directly blocking the growing blood vessel
cells. Angiogenesis inhibitory properties have been discovered in more than 300 substances, ranging from molecules produced naturally in animals and plants, such as
green tea extract, to new chemicals synthesized in the
laboratory. A number of medicines already approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
have also been found to possess antiangiogenic properties, including celecoxib (Celebrex), bortezomib
(Velcade), and interferon. Many inhibitors are currently
being tested in clinical trials for a variety of diseases in
human patients, and some in veterinary settings.
These diseases include:


Eye disease—Excessive new blood vessels growing in
the eye can cause vision loss and lead to blindness.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Antiangiogenic treatments may prevent progressive
loss of vision or even improve eyesight in patients.


Arthritis—Blood vessels that invade the joint release
enzymes that destroy cartilage and other tissues in
arthritis. Antiangiogenic drugs may relieve the arthritic
pain and prevent bone joint destruction caused by
these pathological and destructive blood vessels.



Cancer—Tumors recruit their own private blood
supply to obtain oxygen and nourishment for cancer
cells. By cutting off tumor vasculature (the arrangement of blood vessels in the body or in a particular
organ or tissue), antiangiogenesis therapies may literally starve tumors, and prevent their growth and
spread. Antiangiogenesis may also prove to be useful
when combined with conventional chemotherapy or
radiation therapy, as part of a ‘‘multiple warhead’’
approach to attack cancer via different strategies
simultaneously.

Currently, more than 80 antiangiogenic drugs are
being tested worldwide in human clinical trials
sponsored by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, top medical centers, and the U.S. National
Cancer Institute. The Angiogenesis Foundation is
leading the application of antiangiogenic therapy in
veterinary medicine, for treatment of certain conditions in dogs, cats, and exotic animal species.
Pro-angiogenic therapy works the opposite way as
antiangiogenic therapy by using angiogenic growth
factors or gene therapy to stimulate blood vessel
growth in tissues that require an improved blood
supply. A number of angiogenic growth factors and
gene therapies are currently undergoing clinical trials
in human patients suffering from the following conditions: ischemic heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, and chronic wounds.

Precautions
Since antiangiogenic therapy is still experimental,
only people enrolled in a clinical trial of a particular
drug therapy can use it. The only FDA-approved
drug, bevacizumab (Avastin), is prescribed to treat
colon-rectal cancer. Avastin can result in intestinal
perforation and can cause wounds that have been
stitched to break open, sometimes causing death.
Intestinal perforation, sometimes associated with
abscesses inside the abdomen, occurred throughout
treatment with Avastin. Symptoms included abdominal pain associated with constipation and vomiting.
Avastin therapy should be permanently discontinued
in patients with intestinal perforation or wound
breaks requiring medical intervention. Serious, and

of the body, caused by partial or total blockage of
an artery.
Ocular neovascularization—Abnormal or excessive formation of blood vessels in the eye.
Peripheral vascular disease—A disease affecting
blood vessels, especially in the arms, legs, hands,
and feet.
Vascular—Relating to blood vessels.

drugs to be developed that specifically damage tumorassociated blood vessels and not normal vessels. The
goal of these drugs is to attack cancers by damaging
their blood supply. Many antiangiogenic agents also
appear to hasten the death of tumor-associated blood
vessels.
With the success of targeted agents such as the
biotechnology company Genentech’s Avastin, the
only antiangiogenic drug approved by the FDA to
treat cancer, new efforts are underway to widen and
optimize the field of antiangiogenic agents. As oncology (the study of cancer) drug development accelerates,
new indications are beginning to emerge for diseases
such as ocular neovascularization and even obesity.
Antiangiogenic therapy represents a novel, potentially effective, and non-toxic treatment for cancer. It
is likely that these drugs will provide the next major
breakthrough in the management of people and pets
with cancer. Antiangiogenic therapy will likely
become part of the conventional treatment of cancer
and will be used in combination with surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. These agents are
currently in clinical trials and may become available
to both people and pets in the near future.
Antiangiogenic therapy offers a number of advantages over traditional therapies for cancer:


Tumor cells often mutate and become resistant to
chemotherapy. Because antiangiogenic drugs only
target normal endothelial cells (a layer of cells that
lines the inside of certain body cavities, such as blood
vessels), these cells are less likely to develop acquired
drug resistance.



All tumors rely upon host vessels. Antiangiogenic
agents are therefore effective against a broad range
of cancers.



Conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy indiscriminately attacks all dividing cells in the body,
leading to side effects such as diarrhea, mouth ulcers,
hair loss, and weakened immunity. Antiangiogenic
drugs selectively target dividing blood vessels and
cause fewer side effects.



Antiangiogenic drugs are relatively nontoxic and
work at levels well below the maximum tolerated
dose, so may be given in lower doses over longer
periods of time.



Antiangiogenic treatment may take weeks or even
months to exhibit its full beneficial effect, but this
allows for continuous, chronic control of disease.



Antiangiogenic drugs may also serve as a powerful
supplement to traditional chemotherapy or radiation
therapy.

Description
In the late 1990s, many medical researchers believed
that the Holy Grail of cancer treatment had been found.
Antiangiogenesis therapy was safe, elegant, and at first
apparently effective. But the clinical results soon fell
short of expectations. The tumors, it seemed, had
found a way to circumvent even this most ingenious of
treatment approaches. Despite the setbacks, however,
angiogenesis remains a very tempting target, and
researchers are exploring new agents and approaches
to maximize the effects of antiangiogenic therapies.
Newer studies have demonstrated that in addition
to differences in the regulation of new blood vessel formation in cancer compared with normal tissues, the
actual blood vessels that are ‘‘created’’ in cancers are
different from those created in normal tissues. These
differences have allowed a number of antiangiogenic
256

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Since antiangiogenic drugs are either injected or
administered orally, little or no preparation is needed.
For injections, the site should be first swabbed with
alcohol.

Aftercare
Little or no aftercare is needed following the
administering of antiangiogenic therapy, except for a
small bandage on the injection site.
Although many of these agents are currently being
tested in clinical trials, no reliable way to monitor the
effects of many, if not most, of these therapeutic
agents on the inhibition of the complicated process
of angiogenesis exists. However, in late 2004, scientists
uncovered critical information that may lead to an
urgently needed method for effectively monitoring
antiangiogenic cancer therapies. The research is likely
to facilitate development of new antiangiogenic drugs
or treatment strategies and allow for accurate determination of the optimal drug doses to use for such
therapies. The researchers found that measuring peripheral blood cells can be used as a reliable way to
monitor antiangiogenic drug activity, which can be
used to help establish the optimal biologic dose of
such drugs.

Risks
In general, early research has found the side
effects of antiangiogenesis agents to be mostly minimal. Because these drugs use proteins that are produced in the human body, there is less likelihood that
they will produce the bad side effects common in
radiation treatments and chemotherapy. Still, one
cancer study found that 6 of the 99 patients taking
an antiangiogenesis drug experienced severe bleeding
in the tumors being treated. Four of those patients
died from this complication.
Since antiangiogenesis drugs could affect a
developing fetus, they will probably not be used
for pregnant women or women who might become
pregnant. They may also need to be stopped before
surgery, since blood vessels that are cut at such
times need to repair themselves. Also, people who
have damaged blood vessels (such as those with
heart disease or stroke) may not be able to take
these drugs. Other side effects in people are being
determined. Doctors, scientists and specialists at
the FDA will be monitoring these other side effects
to better understand the toxicity and risks of these
drugs.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Normal results
Since all antiangiogenic therapies are still experimental and in clinical trials, it is difficult to determine
what normal results should be. The goal of antiangiogenic drugs is to stop the development and spread of
certain diseases, especially some cancers. At least four
major proteins and their receptors and signaling pathways commonly govern angiogenesis in solid tumors:
platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and
fibroblast growth factor (basic and acidic). Therapies
that either target these molecules or block their signaling pathways should be effective in preventing solid
tumor growth and spread of the cancer by preventing
the formation of new blood vessels.

Seizure—A sudden attack, spasm, or convulsion.

Purpose
Antianxiety agents, or anxiolytics, may be used to
treat mild transient bouts of anxiety as well as more
pronounced episodes of social phobia and specific
phobia. Clinically significant anxiety is marked by
several symptoms. The patient experiences marked
or persistent fear of one or more social or performance
situations in which he or she is exposed to unfamiliar
people or possible scrutiny by others, and may react in
a humiliating or embarrassing way. The exposure to
the feared situation produces an anxiety attack. Fear
of these episodes of anxiety leads to avoidance behavior, which impairs normal social functioning, including working or attending classes. The patient is aware
that these fears are unjustified.

Description
In psychiatric practice, treatment of anxiety has
largely turned from traditional antianxiety agents,
anxiolytics, to antidepressant therapies. In current
use, the benzodiazepines, the best known class of anxiolytics, have been largely supplanted by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Among the preferred
SSRIs for generalized anxiety disorder are paroxetine
(Paxil), escitalopram (Lexapro), and venlafaxine
(Effexor), which also has norepinephrine. Other
SSRIs are fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft).
258

Venlafaxine and Paroxetine have been shown particularly effective in relieving symptoms of social anxiety.
However, traditional anxiolytics remain useful for
patients who need a rapid onset of action, or whose
frequency of exposure to anxiety provoking stimuli is
low enough to eliminate the need for continued treatment. While SSRIs may require three to five weeks to
show any effects, and must be taken continuously,
benzodiazepines may produce a response within 30
minutes, and may be dosed on an as-needed basis.
The intermediate action benzodiazepines, alprazolam (Xanax), and lorazepam (Ativan) are the appropriate choice for treatment of mild anxiety and social
phobia. Diazepam (Valium) is still widely used for anxiety, but its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, which
has a long half-life, may make this a poorer choice than
other drugs in its class. There is considerable variation
between individuals in metabolism of benzodiazepines,
so patient response may not be predictable. As a class,
benzodiazepines are used not only as anxiolytics, but
also as sedatives, muscle relaxants, and in treatment of
epilepsy and alcoholism. The distinctions between these
uses are largely determined by onset and duration of
action, and route of administration.
Buspirone (BuSpar), which is not chemically
related to other classes of central nervous system
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Benzodiazepines are controlled drugs under federal law. The number of U.S. drug-abuse related trips
to emergency departments involving benzodiazepine
medications exceeded 100,000 in 2002. Buspirone is
not a controlled substance and has no established
abuse potential.

Recommended dosage
Benzodiazepines should be administered 30 to 60
minutes before exposure to the anticipated stress.
Dosage should be individualized to minimize sedation.
The normal dose of alprazolam is 0.25–0.5 mg. The
usual dose of lorazepam is 2–3 mg. Doses may be
repeated if necessary.
Buspirone is initially dosed at 5 mg three times a
day. Patients should increase the dosage 5 mg/day, at
intervals of two to three days, as needed and should
not exceed 60 mg/day. Two to three weeks may be
required before a satisfactory response is seen.

Precautions
Benzodiazepines should not be used in patients with
psychosis, acute narrow angle glaucoma, or liver disease.
The drugs can act as respiratory depressants and should
be avoided in patients with respiratory conditions.
Benzodiazepines are potentially addictive and should
not be administered to patients with substance abuse
disorders. Because benzodiazepines are sedative, they
should be avoided in patients who must remain alert.
Their use for periods over four months has not been
documented. These drugs should not be used during the
second and third trimester of pregnancy, although use
during the first trimester appears to be safe. They should
not be taken while breastfeeding. Physicians and
pharmacists should be consulted about use in children.
Buspirone is metabolized by the liver and excreted
by the kidney, and should be used with care in patients
with hepatic or renal disease. The drug is classified as
schedule B during pregnancy, but should not be taken
during breastfeeding. Its use in children under the age
of 18 years has not been studied.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

In 2004, the FDA cautioned revealed that certain
SSRIs could lead to increased risk of suicide in children and adolescents who took them for depression.
Parents should check with physicians to receive more
information on SSRIs when they are prescribed for
teens and children with anxiety.

Side effects
The most common side effects of benzodiazepines
are secondary to their CNS effects and include
sedation and sleepiness; depression; lethargy; apathy;
fatigue; hypoactivity; lightheadedness; memory impairment; disorientation; anterograde amnesia; restlessness;
confusion; crying or sobbing; delirium; headache; slurred speech; aphonia; dysarthria; stupor; seizures; coma;
syncope; rigidity; tremor; dystonia; vertigo; dizziness;
euphoria; nervousness; irritability; difficulty in concentration; agitation; inability to perform complex mental
functions; akathisia; hemiparesis; hypotonia; unsteadiness; ataxia; incoordination; weakness; vivid dreams;
psychomotor retardation; ‘‘glassy-eyed’’ appearance;
extrapyramidal symptoms; paradoxical reactions.
Other reactions include changes in heart rate and blood
pressure, changes in bowel function, severe skin rash and
changes in genitourinary function. Other adverse
effects have been reported.
Buspirone has a low incidence of side effects.
Dizziness and drowsiness are the most commonly
reported adverse effects. Other CNS effects include
dream disturbances; depersonalization, dysphoria,
noise intolerance, euphoria, akathisia, fearfulness,
loss of interest, disassociative reaction, hallucinations,
suicidal ideation, seizures; feelings of claustrophobia,

I Antiarrhythmic drugs
Definition
Antiarrhythmic drugs are medicines that correct
irregular heartbeats and slow down hearts that beat
too fast.

Purpose
Normally, the heart beats at a steady, even pace.
The pace is controlled by electrical signals that begin in
one part of the heart and quickly spread through the
whole heart. If something goes wrong with this control
system, the result may be an irregular heartbeat, or an
arrhythmia. Antiarrhythmic drugs correct irregular
heartbeats, restoring the normal rhythm. If the heart
is beating too fast, these drugs will slow it down. By
correcting these problems, antiarrhythmic drugs help
the heart work more efficiently.

Description
Antiarrhythmic drugs are available only with a
physician’s prescription and are sold in capsule (regular and extended release), tablet (regular and
extended-release), and injectable forms. Commonly
used antiarrhythmic drugs are disopyramide
(Norpace, Norpace CR), procainamide (Procan SR,
Pronestyl, Pronestyl-SR), and quinidine (Cardioquin,
Duraquin, Quinidex, and other brands). Do not confuse quinidine with quinine, which is a related medicine
with different uses, such as relieving leg cramps.
260

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
antiarrhythmic drug and other factors. Doses may be
different for different patients. Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who
filled the prescription for the correct dosage.
Always take antiarrhythmic drugs exactly as
directed. Never take larger or more frequent doses.
Do not stop taking this medicine without checking
with the physician who prescribed it. Stopping it suddenly could lead to a serious change in heart function.
Antiarrhythmic drugs work best when they are at
constant levels in the blood. To help keep levels constant, take the medicine in doses spaced evenly through
the day and night. Do not miss any doses. If taking
medicine at night interferes with sleep, or if it is difficult
to remember to take the medicine during the day, check
with a health care professional for suggestions.

Precautions
Persons who take these drugs should see their
physician regularly. The physician will check to make
sure the medicine is working as it should and will note
any unwanted side effects.
Some people feel dizzy, lightheaded, or faint when
using these drugs. This medicine may cause blurred
vision or other vision problems. Because of these possible problems, anyone who takes these drugs should
not drive, use machines or do anything else that might
be dangerous until they have found out how the drugs
affect them. If the medicine does cause vision problems, wait until vision is clear before driving or
engaging in other activities that require normal vision.
Antiarrhythmic drugs make some people feel lightheaded, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting or
lying down. To lessen the problem, get up gradually
and hold onto something for support if possible.
Anyone taking this medicine should not drink
alcohol without his or her physician’s approval.
Some antiarrhythmic drugs may change the
results of certain medical tests. Before having medical
tests, anyone taking this medicine should alert the
health care professional in charge.
Anyone who is taking antiarrhythmic drugs
should be sure to tell the health care professional in
charge before having any surgical or dental procedures or receiving emergency treatment.
Antiarrhythmic drugs may cause low blood sugar
in some people. Anyone who experiences symptoms of
low blood sugar should eat or drink a food that

KEY TERMS

Antiarrhythmic drugs may cause dry mouth. To
temporarily relieve the discomfort, chew sugarless gum,
suck on sugarless candy or ice chips, or use saliva substitutes, which come in liquid and tablet forms and are
available without a prescription. If the problem continues for more than 2 weeks, check with a physician or
dentist. Mouth dryness that continues over a long time
may contribute to tooth decay and other dental problems.
People taking antiarrhythmic drugs may sweat
less, which can cause the body temperature to rise.
Anyone who takes this medicine should be careful
not to become overheated during exercise or hot
weather and should avoid hot baths, hot tubs, and
saunas. Overheating could lead to heat stroke.
Older people may be especially sensitive to the
effects of antiarrhythmic drugs. This may increase
the risk of certain side effects, such as dry mouth,
difficult urination, and dizziness or lightheadedness.
The antiarrhythmic drug procainamide can cause
serious blood disorders. Anyone taking this medicine

Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines may have problems if
they take antiarrhythmic drugs. Before taking these
drugs, be sure to let the physician know about any of
these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reac-

tions to an antiarrhythmic drug in the past should let
his or her physician know before taking this type of
medicine again. Patients taking procainamide should
let their physicians know if they have ever had an
unusual or allergic reaction to procaine or any other
‘‘caine-type’’ medicine, such as xylocaine or lidocaine.
Patients taking quinidine should mention any previous reactions to quinine. The physician should also
be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
CONGESTIVE
HEART
DISEASE. Antiarrhythmic
drugs may cause low blood sugar, which can be a
particular problem for people with congestive heart
disease. Anyone with congestive heart disease should
be familiar with the signs of low blood sugar (listed
above) and should check with his or her physician
about what to do if such symptoms occur.
DIABETES. Antiarrhythmic drugs may cause low
blood sugar, which can be a particular problem for
people with diabetes. Anyone with diabetes should be
familiar with the signs of low blood sugar (listed
above) and should check with his or her physician
about what to do if such symptoms occur.
PREGNANCY. The effects of taking antiarrhythmic
drugs in pregnancy have not been studied in humans. In
studies of laboratory animals, this medicine increased
the risk of miscarriage. In addition, some women who
have taken these drugs while pregnant have had contractions of the uterus (womb). Women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant should check with
their physicians before taking this medicine. Women
who become pregnant while taking this medicine
should let their physicians know right away.
BREASTFEEDING. Antiarrhythmic drugs pass into

breast milk. Women who are breastfeeding should
check with their physicians before taking this medicine.
262

USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking antiarrhythmic
drugs with certain other drugs may affect the way the
drugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.

Side effects
The most common side effects are dry mouth and
throat, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. These problems
usually go away as the body adjusts to the drug and do
not require medical treatment. Less common side
effects, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred
vision, dry eyes and nose, frequent urge to urinate,
bloating, constipation, stomach pain, and decreased
sexual ability, also may occur and do not need medical
attention unless they do not go away or they interfere
with normal activities.
More serious side effects are not common, but
may occur. If any of the following side effects occur,
check with the physician who prescribed the medicine
as soon as possible:


fever and chills



difficult urination



swollen or painful joints



pain when breathing



skin rash or itching

People who are especially sensitive to quinidine
may have a reaction to the first dose or doses. If any of
these side effects occur after taking quinidine, check

because the airways naturally expand when a person
takes a breath. The real problem arises when the person with asthma tries to breathe out. The air cannot
get out through the blocked airways, so it stays
trapped in the lungs. With each new breath, the person
can take in only a little more air, so breathing becomes
shallow and takes more and more effort.
Asthma attacks can be caused by allergies to pollen, dust, pets or other things, but people without
known allergies may also have asthma. Exercise, stress,
intense emotions, exposure to cold, certain medicines
and some medical conditions also can bring on attacks.
The two main approaches to dealing with asthma
are avoiding substances and situations that trigger
attacks and using medicines that treat or prevent the
symptoms. With a combination of the two, most people with asthma can find relief and live normal lives.

Description
Nancy Ross-Flanigan

Three types of drugs are used in treating and preventing asthma attacks:


Bronchodilators relax the smooth muscles that line
the airway. This makes the airways open wider, letting more air pass through them. These drugs are
used mainly to relieve sudden asthma attacks or to
prevent attacks that might come on after exercise.
They may be taken by mouth, injected or inhaled.
Bronchodilators may be taken in pill or liquid form,
but normally are used as inhalers, which go directly
to the lungs and result in fewer side effects.



Corticosteroids block the inflammation that narrows
the airways. Used regularly, these drugs will help prevent asthma attacks. Those attacks that do occur will
be less severe. However, corticosteroids cannot stop
an attack that is already underway. These drugs may
be taken by mouth, injected or inhaled.

I Antiasthmatic drugs
Definition
Antiasthmatic drugs are medicines that treat or
prevent asthma attacks.

Purpose
For people with asthma, the simple act of breathing can be a struggle. Their airways become inflamed
and blocked with mucus during asthma attacks, narrowing the opening through which air passes. This is
not such a problem when the person breathes in,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

263

Antiasthmatic drugs

Antiasthmatic drugs





Leukotriene modifiers (montelukast and zafirlukast)
are a new type of drug that can be used in place of
steroids, for older children or adults who have a mild
degree of asthma that persists. They work by counteracting leukotrienes, which are substances released
by white blood cells in the lung that cause the air
passages to constrict and promote mucus secretion.
Leukotriene modifiers also fight off some forms of
rhinitis, an added bonus for people with asthma.
However, they are not proven effective in fighting
seasonal allergies.
Cromolyn also is taken regularly to prevent asthma
attacks and may be used alone or with other asthma
medicines. It cannot stop an attack that already has
started. The drug works by preventing certain cells in
the body from releasing substances that cause allergic reactions or asthma symptoms. One brand of this
drug, Nasalcrom, comes in capsule and nasal spray
forms and is used to treat hay fever and other allergies. The inhalation form of the drug, Intal, is used
for asthma. It comes in aerosol canisters, in capsules
that are inserted into an inhaler, and in liquid form
that is used in a nebulizer.

Precautions
Using antiasthmatic drugs properly is important.
Because bronchodilators provide quick relief, some people may be tempted to overuse them. However, with
some kinds of bronchodilators, this can lead to serious
and possibly life-threatening complications. In the long
run, patients are better off using bronchodilators only as
directed and also using corticosteroids, which eventually
will reduce their need for bronchodilators. However, a
2004 Canadian study has questioned a standard practice
of increasing steroids after asthma attacks or worsened
symptoms. Also, research in 2004 showed that people
with asthma who worked closely with their physicians to
self-manage their asthma had fewer attacks, which
reduces the need for bronchodilators. Carefully managing asthma also reduces visits to the emergency department and hospitalizations.
Corticosteroids are powerful drugs that may
cause serious side effects when used over a long time.
However, these problems are much less likely with the
inhalant forms than with the oral and injected forms.
While the oral and injected forms generally should be
used only for one to two weeks, the inhalant forms
may be used for long periods.
It is important to remember that leukotriene modifiers are used to prevent and manage asthma, not to
stop an attack. A physician or pharmacist can advise
patients on possible interactions with other drugs.
264

Patients who are using their antiasthmatic drugs
correctly but feel their asthma is not under control
should see their physicians. The physician can either
increase the dose, switch to another medicine or add
another medicine to the regimen. A 2004 survey
showed that 70% of people with mild to moderate
asthma were not taking the correct dose of asthma
medication.
When used to prevent asthma attacks, cromolyn
must be taken as directed every day. The drug may
take as long as four weeks to start working. Unless
told to do so by a physician, patients should not stop
taking the drug just because it does not seem to be
working. When symptoms do begin to improve,
patients should continue taking all medicines that
have been prescribed, unless a physician directs
otherwise.

Side effects
Inhalant forms of antiasthmatic drugs may cause
dryness or irritation in the throat, dry mouth, or an
unpleasant taste in the mouth. To help prevent these
problems, gargling and rinsing the mouth or taking a
sip of water after each dose is recommended.
More serious side effects are not common when
these medicines are used properly. However, anyone
who has unusual or bothersome symptoms after taking an antiasthmatic drug should get in touch with a
physician.

Interactions
A physician or pharmacist should be consulted
before combining antiasthmatic drugs with any other
prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter)
medicine.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Definition
Antibiotic-associated colitis is an inflammation of
the intestines that sometimes occurs following antibiotic treatment and is caused by toxins produced by the
bacterium Clostridium difficile.

Description
Antibiotic-associated colitis, also called antibioticassociated enterocolitis, can occur following antibiotic
treatment. The bacteria Clostridia difficile are normally
found in the intestines of 5% of healthy adults, but
people can also pick up the bacteria while they are in a
hospital or nursing home. In a healthy person, harmless
resident intestinal bacteria compete with each other for
food and places to ‘‘sit’’ along the inner intestinal wall.
When antibiotics are given, most of the resident bacteria
are killed. With fewer bacteria to compete with, the
normally harmless Clostridia difficile grow rapidly and
produce toxins. These toxins damage the inner wall of
the intestines and cause inflammation and diarrhea.
Although all antibiotics can cause this disease, it is
most commonly caused by clindamycin (Cleocin), ampicillin (Omnipen), amoxicillin (Amoxil, Augmentin, or
Wymox), and any in the cephalosporin class (such as
cefazolin or cephalexin). Symptoms of the condition can
occur during antibiotic treatment or within four weeks
after the treatment has stopped.
In approximately half of cases of antibiotic-associated colitis, the condition progresses to a more severe
form of colitis called pseudomembranous enterocolitis
in which pseudomembranes are excreted in the stools.
Pseudomembranes are membrane-like collections of
white blood cells, mucus, and the protein that causes
blood to clot (fibrin) that are released by the damaged
intestinal wall.

Causes and symptoms
Antibiotic-associated colitis is caused by toxins
produced by the bacterium Clostridium difficile after
treatment with antibiotics. When most of the other
intestinal bacteria have been killed, Clostridium difficile grows rapidly and releases toxins that damage the
intestinal wall. The disease and symptoms are caused
by these toxins, not by the bacterium itself.
Symptoms of antibiotic-associated colitis usually
begin four to ten days after antibiotic treatment has
begun. The early signs and symptoms of this disease
include lower abdominal cramps, an increased need to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Edema—Fluid accumulation in a tissue.

pass stool, and watery diarrhea. As the disease progresses, the patient may experience a general ill feeling,
fatigue, abdominal pain, and fever. If the disease proceeds to pseudomembranous enterocolitis, the patient
may also experience nausea, vomiting, large amounts
of watery diarrhea, and a very high fever (104-105 8F/
40-40.5 8C). Complications of antibiotic-associated
colitis include severe dehydration, imbalances in
blood minerals, low blood pressure, fluid accumulation in deep skin (edema), enlargement of the large
intestine (toxic megacolon), and the formation of a
tear (perforation) in the wall of the large intestine.
The Clostridium difficile toxin is found in the
stools of persons older than 60 years of age 20-100
times more frequently than in the stools of persons
who are 10-20 years old. As a result, the elderly are
much more prone to developing antibiotic-associated
colitis than younger individuals.

Diagnosis
Antibiotic-associated colitis can be diagnosed by
the symptoms and recent medical history of the
patient, by a laboratory test for the bacterial toxin,
and/or by using a procedure called endoscopy.
If the diarrhea and related symptoms occurred after
the patient received antibiotics, antibiotic-associated
colitis may be suspected. A stool sample may be analyzed
for the presence of the Clostridium difficile toxin. This
toxin test is the preferred diagnostic test for antibioticassociated colitis. One frequently used test for the toxin
involves adding the processed stool sample to a human
cell culture. If the toxin is present in the stool sample, the
cells die. It may take up to two days to get the results

from this test. A simpler test, which provides results in
two to three hours, is also available. Symptoms and toxin
test results are usually enough to diagnose the disease.
Another tool that may be useful in the diagnosis
of antibiotic-associated colitis, however, is a procedure called an endoscopy that involves inserting a
thin, lighted tube into the rectum to visually inspect
the intestinal lining. Two different types of endoscopy
procedures, the sigmoidoscopy and the colonoscopy,
are used to view different parts of the large intestine.
These procedures are performed in a hospital or doctor’s office. Patients are sedated during the procedure
to make them more comfortable and are allowed to go
home after recovering from the sedation.

then compete for space and keep the Clostridium
difficile from over-populating.
Several types of supplements can be used.
Supplements containing Lactobacillus acidophilus, the
bacteria commonly found in yogurt and some types of
milk, Lactobacillus bifidus, and Streptococcus faecium,
are available in many stores in powder, capsule, tablet,
and liquid form. Acidophilus also acts as a mild antibiotic, which helps it to reestablish itself in the intestine,
and all may aid in the production of some B vitamins
and vitamin K. These supplements can be taken individually and alternated weekly or together following one
or more courses of antibiotics.

Prognosis
Treatment
Diarrhea, regardless of the cause, is always treated
by encouraging the individual to replace lost fluids and
prevent dehydration. One method to treat antibioticassociated colitis is to simply stop taking the antibiotic
that caused the disease. This allows the normal intestinal bacteria to repopulate the intestines and inhibits
the overgrowth of Clostridium difficile. Many patients
with mild disease respond well to this and are free from
diarrhea within two weeks. It is important, however, to
make sure that the original disease for which the antibiotics were prescribed is treated.
Because of the potential seriousness of this disease,
most patients are given another antibiotic to control the
growth of the Clostridium difficile, usually vancomycin
(Vancocin) or metronidazole (Flagyl or Protostat). Both
are designed to be taken orally four times a day for 10-14
days. Upon finishing antibiotic treatment, approximately 15-20% of patients will experience a relapse of
diarrhea within one to five weeks. Mild relapses can go
untreated with great success, however, severe relapses of
diarrhea require another round of antibiotic treatment.
Instead of further antibiotic treatment, a cholestyramine
resin (Questran or Prevalite) may be given. The bacterial
toxins produced in the intestine stick to the resin and are
passed out with the resin in the stool. Unfortunately,
however, vancomycin also sticks to the resin, so these
two drugs cannot be taken at the same time. Serious
disease may require hospitalization so that the patient
can be monitored, treated, and rehydrated.

Alternative treatment
The goal of alternative treatment for antibioticassociated enterocolitis is to repopulate the intestinal
environment with microorganisms that are normal and
healthy for the intestinal tract. These microorgansisms
266

With appropriate treatment and replenishment of
fluids, the prognosis is generally excellent. One or more
relapses can occur. Very severe colitis can cause a tear
(perforation) in the wall of the large intestine that would
require major surgery. Perforation of the intestine can
cause a serious abdominal infection. Antibiotic-associated colitis can be fatal in people who are elderly
and/or have a serious underlying illness, such as cancer.

Prevention
There are no specific preventative measures for this
disease. Good general health can reduce the chance of
developing a bacterial infection that would require antibiotic treatment and the chance of picking up the
Clostridia bacteria. Maintaining good general health
can also reduce the seriousness and length of the condition, should it develop following antibiotic therapy.

I Antibiotics
Definition
Antibiotics may be informally defined as the subgroup of anti-infectives that are derived from bacterial
sources and are used to treat bacterial infections.
Other classes of drugs, most notably the sulfonamides,

may be effective antibacterials. Similarly, some antibiotics may have secondary uses, such as the use of
demeclocycline (Declomycin, a tetracycline derivative) to treat the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion. Other antibiotics
may be useful in treating protozoal infections.

Purpose
Antibiotics are used for treatment or prevention
of bacterial infection.

Description
Classifications
Although there are several classification schemes
for antibiotics, based on bacterial spectrum (broad
versus narrow) or route of administration (injectable
versus oral versus topical), or type of activity (bactericidal vs. bacteriostatic), the most useful is based on
chemical structure. Antibiotics within a structural
class will generally show similar patterns of effectiveness, toxicity, and allergic potential.
PENICILLINS. The penicillins are the oldest class of

antibiotics, and have a common chemical structure
which they share with the cephalopsorins. The two
groups are classed as the beta-lactam antibiotics, and
are generally bacteriocidal—that is, they kill bacteria
rather than inhibiting growth. The penicillins can be
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

CEPHALOSPORINS. Cephalosporins and the closely
related cephamycins and carbapenems, like the pencillins, contain a beta-lactam chemical structure.
Consequently, there are patterns of cross-resistance
and cross-allergenicity among the drugs in these
classes. The ‘‘cepha’’ drugs are among the most diverse
classes of antibiotics, and are themselves subgrouped
into 1st, 2nd and 3rd generations. Each generation has
a broader spectrum of activity than the one before. In
addition, cefoxitin, a cephamycin, is highly active
against anaerobic bacteria, which offers utility in treatment of abdominal infections. The 3rd generation
drugs, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, ceftriaxone and others,
cross the blood-brain barrier and may be used to treat
meningitis and encephalitis. Cephalopsorins are the
usually preferred agents for surgical prophylaxis.
FLUROQUINOLONES. The fluroquinolones are synthetic antibacterial agents, and not derived from bacteria.
They are included here because they can be readily interchanged with traditional antibiotics. An earlier, related
class of antibacterial agents, the quinolones, were not
well absorbed, and could be used only to treat urinary
tract infections. The fluroquinolones, which are based
on the older group, are broad-spectrum bacteriocidal
drugs that are chemically unrelated to the penicillins or
the cephaloprosins. They are well distributed into bone
tissue, and so well absorbed that in general they are as
effective by the oral route as by intravenous infusion.
TETRACYCLINES. Tetracyclines got their name
because they share a chemical structure that has four
rings. They are derived from a species of Streptomyces
bacteria. Broad-spectrum bacteriostatic agents, the tetracyclines may be effective against a wide variety of microorganisms, including rickettsia and amoebic parasites.
MACROLIDES. The macrolide antibiotics are
derived from Streptomyces bacteria, and got their
name because they all have a macrocyclic lactone
chemical structure. Erythromycin, the prototype of
this class, has a spectrum and use similar to penicillin.
Newer members of the group, azithromycin and
clarithyromycin, are particularly useful for their high

further subdivided. The natural pencillins are based on
the original penicillin G structure; penicillinase-resistant
penicillins, notably methicillin and oxacillin, are active
even in the presence of the bacterial enzyme that inactivates most natural penicillins. Aminopenicillins such as
ampicillin and amoxicillin have an extended spectrum
of action compared with the natural penicillins;
extended spectrum penicillins are effective against a
wider range of bacteria. These generally include coverage for Pseudomonas aeruginaosa and may provide the
penicillin in combination with a penicillinase inhibitor.

Different antibiotics destroy bacteria in different ways. Some short-circuit the processes by which bacteria receive energy.
Others disturb the structure of the bacterial cell wall, as shown in the illustration above. Still others interfere with the production

according to their established risks for use during
pregnancy. Category A: Controlled human studies
have demonstrated no fetal risk. Category B:
Animal studies indicate no fetal risk, but no
human studies; or adverse effects in animals, but
not in well-controlled human studies. Category C:
No adequate human or animal studies; or adverse
fetal effects in animal studies, but no available

level of lung penetration. Clarithromycin has been
widely used to treat Helicobacter pylori infections,
the cause of stomach ulcers.
OTHERS. Other classes of antibiotics include the
aminoglycosides, which are particularly useful for
their effectiveness in treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa
infections; the lincosamindes, clindamycin and lincomycin, which are highly active against anaerobic
pathogens. There are other, individual drugs which
may have utility in specific infections.

Recommended dosage
Dosage varies with drug, route of administration,
pathogen, site of infection, and severity. Additional
considerations include renal function, age of patient,
and other factors. Consult manufacturers’ recommendations for dose and route.

Side effects
All antibiotics cause risk of overgrowth by nonsusceptible bacteria. Manufacturers list other major
hazards by class; however, the health care provider
should review each drug individually to assess the degree
of risk. Generally, breastfeeding is not recommended
while taking antibiotics because of risk of alteration to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

or a reasonable presumption of bacterial infection. The
use of antibiotics in viral infections is to be avoided.
Avoid use of fluroquinolones for trivial infections.

Penicillins: Hypersensitivity may be common, and
cross allergenicity with cephalosporins has been reported.
Penicillins are classed as category B during pregnancy.

In severe infections, presumptive therapy with a
broad-spectrum antibiotic such as a 3rd generation
cephalosporin may be appropriate. Treatment should
be changed to a narrow spectrum agent as soon as the
pathogen has been identified. After 48 hours of treatment, if there is clinical improvement, an oral antibiotic should be considered.

Cephalopsorins: Several cephalopsorins and
related compounds have been associated with seizures.
Cefmetazole, cefoperazone, cefotetan and ceftriaxone
may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity
and coagulation abnormalities. Pseudomembranous
colitis has been reported with cephalosporins and
other broad spectrum antibiotics. Some drugs in this
class may cause renal toxicity. Pregnancy category B.
Fluroquinolones: Lomefloxacin has been associated
with increased photosensitivity. All drugs in this class have
been associated with convulsions. Pregnancy category C.
Tetracyclines: Demeclocycline may cause increased
photosensitivity. Minocycline may cause dizziness.
Do not use tetracyclines in children under the age of
eight, and specifically avoid during periods of tooth
development. Oral tetracyclines bind to anions such as
calcium and iron. Although doxycycline and minocycline may be taken with meals, patients must be advised
to take other tetracycline antibiotics on an empty stomach, and not to take the drugs with milk or other
calcium-rich foods. Expired tetracycline should never
be administered. Pregnancy category D. Use during
pregnancy may cause alterations in bone development.
Macrolides: Erythromycin may aggravate the weakness of patients with myasthenia gravis. Azithromycin
has, rarely, been associated with allergic reactions,
including angioedema, anaphylaxis, and dermatologic
reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and
toxic epidermal necrolysis. Oral erythromycin may be
highly irritating to the stomach and when given by
injection may cause severe phlebitis. These drugs should
be used with caution in patients with liver dysfunction.
Pregnancy category B: Azithromycin, erythromycin. Pregnancy category C: Clarithromycin, dirithromycin, troleandomycin.
Aminoglycosides: This class of drugs causes kidney and ototoxicity. These problems can occur even
with normal doses. Dosing should be based on renal
function, with periodic testing of both kidney function
and hearing. Pregnancy category D.

Recommended usage
To minimize risk of adverse reactions and development of resistant strains of bacteria, antibiotics should
be restricted to use in cases where there is either known

I Antibiotics, ophthalmic
Definition
Ophthalmic antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria that cause eye infections.

Purpose
Ophthalmic antibiotics are applied to the eye, or
under the eyelid, to treat eye infections caused by bacteria.

Description
The medicine described here, tobramycin
(Tobrex), comes in the form of eye drops or ointment.
It is available only with a physician’s prescription.

Recommended dosage
The dosages given here are typical doses. Physicians
may adjust the number of doses per day, the time
between doses, and the length of treatment with the
medicine, depending on the patient’s particular medical
problem. If the physician’s directions are different
from those given here, follow the physician’s directions.
Adults
EYE DROPS. For mild to moderate infections, use one
to two drops in the affected eye or eyes every four hours.

For severe infections, use two drops in the affected
eye or eyes every two hours until the condition improves.

KEY TERMS
Bacteria—Tiny, one-celled forms of life that cause

At that time, the physician will determine how much
to use until the infection is completely cleared up.

The main side effects of this medicine are itching,
redness, and swelling of the eye or eyelid. Allergic
reactions also are possible. If any of these symptoms
occur, call the physician who prescribed the medicine.

Interactions
Patients who are using any other prescription or
nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines in their
eyes should check with their physicians before using
tobramycin.
Nancy Ross-Flanigan

OINTMENT. For mild to moderate infections,

squeeze a half-inch ribbon of ointment into the
affected eye or eyes two or three times a day. Do not
let the tip of the ointment tube touch the eye.
For severe infections, squeeze a half-inch ribbon
of ointment into the affected eye or eyes every three to
four hours until the condition improves. At that time,
the physician will determine how much to use until the
infection is completely cleared up.
Children
The child’s physician should determine the proper
dose.

Precautions
Use this drug as often as directed, for as long as
directed. Although the symptoms may have disappeared, the infection may not clear up completely if
the drug is stopped too soon. Therefore, the medication may be prescribed for several days after the infection appears to have cleared. However, it is just as
important to use the drug for only as long as directed.
Using it for too long may lead to the growth of bacteria that do not respond to the drug. These bacteria
may then cause infections that can be very difficult to
treat. Make sure the physician or pharmacist specifies
how long the medication is to be used.
Anyone who has had an allergic reaction to tobramycin or any other ingredients of Tobrex should not
use this medicine. Be sure to tell the physician about
any past reactions to the drug or its ingredients.
Anyone who has an allergic reaction to tobramycin
should stop using it immediately and call a physician.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who
plan to become pregnant should check with their physicians before using tobramycin.

I Antibiotics, topical
Definition
Topical antibiotics are medicines applied to the
skin to kill bacteria.

Purpose
Topical antibiotics help prevent infections caused
by bacteria that get into minor cuts, scrapes, and
burns. Treating minor wounds with antibiotics allows
quicker healing. If the wounds are left untreated, the
bacteria will multiply, causing pain, redness, swelling,
itching, and oozing. Untreated infections can eventually spread and become much more serious.
Different kinds of topical antibiotics kill different
kinds of bacteria. Many antibiotic first-aid products
contain combinations of antibiotics to make them
effective against a broad range of bacteria.
When treating a wound, it is not enough to simply
apply a topical antibiotic. The wound must first be
cleaned with soap and water and patted dry. After the
antibiotic is applied, the wound should be covered
with a dressing, such as a bandage or a protective gel
or spray. For many years, it was thought that wounds
heal best when exposed to the air. But now most
experts say it is best to keep wounds clean and moist
while they heal. The covering should still allow some
air to reach the wound, however.

Description
Some topical antibiotics are available without a
prescription and are sold in many forms, including

need the attention of a physician to prevent complications such as blood poisoning.
Topical antibiotics are meant to be used only on
the skin and only for only a few days at a time. If the
wound has not healed in five days, stop using the
antibiotic and call a doctor.

Fungal—Caused by a fungus.
Fungus—A member of a group of simple organisms
that are related to yeast and molds.

Do not use topical antibiotics on large areas of skin
or on open wounds. These products should not be used
to treat diaper rash in infants or incontinence rash in
adults.

Incontinence—The inability to control the bladder
or bowel.
Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat
that usually develop in response to injury or illness.

Only minor cuts, scrapes, and burns should be
treated with topical antibiotics. Certain kinds of injuries may need medical care and should not be selftreated with topical antibiotics. These include:

creams, ointments, powders, and sprays. Some widely
used topical antibiotics are bacitracin, neomycin,
mupirocin, and polymyxin B. Among the products
that contain one or more of these ingredients are
Bactroban (a prescription item), Neosporin,
Polysporin, and Triple Antibiotic Ointment or Cream.

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
topical antibiotic. Follow the directions on the package label or ask a pharmacist for directions.
In general, topical antibiotics should be applied
within four hours after injury. Do not use more than
the recommended amount and do not apply it more
often than three times a day. Do not apply the medicine over large areas of skin or on open wounds.

Precautions
Many public health experts are concerned about
antibiotic resistance, a problem that can develop when
antibiotics are overused. Over time, bacteria develop
new defenses against antibiotics that once were effective
against them. Because bacteria reproduce so quickly,
these defenses can be rapidly passed on through generations of bacteria until almost all are immune to the
effects of a particular antibiotic. The process happens
faster than new antibiotics can be developed. To help
control the problem, many experts advise people to use
topical antibiotics only for short periods, that is, until
the wound heals, and only as directed. For the topical
antibiotic to work best, it should be used only to prevent infection in a fresh wound, not to treat an infection
that has already started. Wounds that are not fresh may

Although topical antibiotics control infections
caused by bacteria, they may allow fungal infections
to develop. The use of other medicines to treat the
fungal infections may be necessary. Check with the
physician or pharmacist.
Some people may be allergic to one or more ingredients in a topical antibiotic product. If an allergic
reaction develops, stop using the product immediately
and call a physician.
No harmful or abnormal effects have been
reported in babies whose mothers used topical antibiotics while pregnant or nursing. However, pregnant
women generally are advised not to use any drugs
during the first 3 months after conception. A woman
who is pregnant or breastfeeding or who plans to
become pregnant should check with her physician
before using a topical antibiotic.
Unless a physician says to do so, do not use topical antibiotics on children under two years of age.

Purpose

Other rare side effects may occur. Anyone who
has unusual symptoms after using a topical antibiotic should get in touch with the physician who prescribed or the pharmacist who recommedned the
medication.

Interactions
Using certain topical antibiotics at the same time
as hydrocortisone (a topical corticosteroid used to
treat inflammation) may hide signs of infection or
allergic reaction. Do not use these two medicines at
the same time unless told to do so by a health care
provider.
Anyone who is using any other type of prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine
on the skin should check with a doctor before using a

I Anticancer drugs

Anticancer drugs are used to control the growth of
cancerous cells. Cancer is commonly defined as the
uncontrolled growth of cells, with loss of differentiation and commonly, with metastasis, spread of the
cancer to other tissues and organs. Cancers are malignant growths. In contrast, benign growths remain
encapsulated and grow within a well-defined area.
Although benign tumors may be fatal if untreated,
due to pressure on essential organs, as in the case of a
benign brain tumor, surgery or radiation are the preferred methods of treating growths which have a well
defined location. Drug therapy is used when the tumor
has spread, or may spread, to all areas of the body.

Description
Several classes of drugs may be used in cancer
treatment, depending on the nature of the organ
involved. For example, breast cancers are commonly
stimulated by estrogens, and may be treated with
drugs that inactivate the sex hormones. Similarly,
prostate cancer may be treated with drugs that inactivate androgens, the male sex hormone. However, the
majority of antineoplastic drugs act by interfering
with cell growth. Since cancerous cells grow more
rapidly than other cells, the drugs target those cells
that are in the process of reproducing themselves. As a
result, antineoplastic drugs will commonly affect not
only the cancerous cells, but others cells that commonly reproduce quickly, including hair follicles,
ovaries and testes, and the blood-forming organs.
Newer methods of antineoplastic drug therapy
have taken different approaches, including angiogenesis—the inhibition of formation of blood vessels feeding the tumor and contributing to tumor growth.
Although these approaches hold promise, they are
not yet in common use. Developing new anticancer
drugs is the work of ongoing research. In 2003, a new
technique was developed to streamline the search for
effective drugs. Researchers pumped more than 23,000
chemical compounds through a screening technique to
identify those that help fight cancer while leaving

in identifying anticancer dugs that are not completely
toxic to healthy cells.
Antineoplastic drugs may be divided into two
classes: cycle specific and non-cycle specific. Cycle
specific drugs act only at specific points of the cell’s
duplication cycle, such as anaphase or metaphase,
while non-cycle specific drugs may act at any point in
the cell cycle. In order to gain maximum effect, antineoplastic drugs are commonly used in combinations.

Precautions
Because antineoplastic agents do not target specific cell types, they have a number of common
adverse side effects. Hair loss is common due to the
effects on hair follicles, and anemia, immune system
impairment, and clotting problems are caused by
destruction of the blood-forming organs, leading to
a reduction in the number of red cells, white cells, and
platelets. Because of the frequency and severity of
these side effects, it is common to administer chemotherapy in cycles, allowing time for recovery from
the drug effects before administering the next dose.
Doses are often calculated, not on the basis of weight,
but rather based on blood counts, in order to avoid
dangerous levels of anemia (red cell depletion), neutropenia (white cell deficiency), or thrombocytopenia
(platelet deficiency.)
The health professional has many responsibilities
in dealing with patients undergoing chemotherapy.
The patient must be well informed of the risks and
benefits of chemotherapy, and must be emotionally
prepared for the side effects. These may be permanent,
and younger patients should be aware of the high risk
of sterility after chemotherapy.
The patient must also know which side effects
should be reported to the practitioner, since many
adverse effects do not appear until several days after
a dose of chemotherapy. When chemotherapy is selfadministered, the patient must be familiar with
proper use of the drugs, including dose scheduling
and avoidance of drug-drug and food-drug
interactions.
274

Appropriate steps should be taken to minimize
side effects. These may include administration of antinauseant medications to reduce nausea and vomiting,
maintaining fluid levels to reduce drug toxicity, particularly to the kidneys, or application of a scalp tourniquet to reduce blood flow to the scalp and minimize
hair loss due to drug therapy.
Patients receiving chemotherapy also are at risk of
infections due to reduced white blood counts. While
prophylactic antibiotics may be useful, the health care
professional should also be sure to use standard precautions, including gowns and gloves when appropriate. Patients should be alerted to avoid risks of viral
contamination, and live virus immunizations are contraindicated until the patient has fully recovered from
the effects of chemotherapy. Similarly, the patient
should avoid contact with other people who have
recently had live virus immunizations.
Other precautions which should be emphasized
are the risks to pregnant or nursing women. Because
antineoplastic drugs are commonly harmful to the
fetus, women of childbearing potential should be cautioned to use two effective methods of birth control
while receiving cancer chemotherapy. This also applies
if the woman’s male partner is receiving chemotherapy. Breastfeeding should be avoided while the mother
is being treated.
Before prescribing or administering anticancer
drugs, health care providers should inquire whether
the patient has any of the following conditions:

Anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs

I Anticoagulant
and antiplatelet
drugs

KEY TERMS
Anticoagulant—Drug used to prevent clot formation or to prevent a clot that has formed from enlarging. Anticoagulant drugs inhibit clot formation by
blocking the action of clotting factors or platelets.
Anticoagulant drugs fall into three groups: inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis, inhibitors of thrombin and antiplatelet drugs.

Definition
Anticoagulants are drugs used to prevent clot formation or to prevent a clot that has formed from enlarging. They inhibit clot formation by blocking the action
of clotting factors or platelets. Anticoagulant drugs fall
into three categories: inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis, inhibitors of thrombin and antiplatelet drugs.

Antiplatelet drug—Drug that inhibits platelets from
aggregating to form a plug. They are used to prevent
clotting and alter the natural course of atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis—Condition characterized by
deposits of fatty plaque in the arteries.

Purpose
Anticoagulant drugs reduce the ability of the blood
to form clots. Although blood clotting is essential to
prevent serious bleeding in the case of skin cuts, clots
inside the blood vessels block the flow of blood to major
organs and cause heart attacks and strokes. Although
these drugs are sometimes called blood thinners, they
do not actually thin the blood. Furthermore, this type
of medication will not dissolve clots that already have
formed, although the drug stops an existing clot from
worsening. However, another type of drug, used in
thrombolytic therapy, will dissolve existing clots.
Anticoagulant drugs are used for a number of conditions. For example, they may be given to prevent blood
clots from forming after the replacement of a heart valve
or to reduce the risk of a stroke or another heart attack
after a first heart attack. They are also used to reduce the
chance of blood clots forming during open heart surgery
or bypass surgery. Low doses of these drugs may be
given to prevent blood clots in patients who must stay in
bed for a long time after certain types of surgery.
Because anticoagulants affect the blood’s ability
to clot, they can increase the risk of severe bleeding
and heavy blood loss. It is thus essential to take these
drugs exactly as directed and to see a physician regularly as long as they are prescribed.

Description
Anticoagulant drugs, also called anticlotting drugs
or blood thinners, are available only with a physician’s
prescription. They come in tablet and injectable forms.
They fall into three groups:


Inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis. These anticoagulants inhibit the production of certain clotting
factors in the liver. One example is warfarin (brand
name: coumadin).



Inhibitors of thrombin. Thrombin inhibitors interfere
with blood clotting by blocking the activity of thrombin. They include heparin, lepirudin (Refludan).

276

Clot—A soft, semi-solid mass that forms when
blood gels.
Platelet—A small, disk-shaped body in the blood
that has an important role in blood clotting: they
form the initial plug at the rupture site of a blood
vessel.
Thrombin—Thrombin is a protein produced by the
body. It is a specific clotting factor that plays an
important role in the blood clotting process.
Thrombin inhibitor—Thrombin inhibitors are one
type of anticoagulant medication, used to help prevent formation of harmful blood clots in the body
by blocking the activity of thrombin.



Antiplatelet drugs. Antiplatelet drugs interact with
platelets, which is a type of blood cell, to block platelets from aggregating into harmful clots. They include:
aspirin, ticlopidine (Ticlid), clopidogrel (Plavix), tirofiban (Aggrastat), and eptifibatide (Integrilin).

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
anticoagulant drug and the medical condition for
which it is prescribed. The prescribing physician or
the pharmacist who filled the prescription can provide
information concerning the correct dosage. Usually,
the physician will adjust the dose after checking the
patient’s clotting time.
Anticoagulant drugs must be taken exactly as directed by the physician. Larger or more frequent doses
should not be taken, and the drug should also not be
taken for longer than prescribed. Taking too much of this
medication can cause severe bleeding. Anticoagulants
should also be taken on schedule. A record of each
dose should be kept as it is taken. If a dose is missed, it
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Precautions
Persons who take anticoagulants should see a physician regularly while taking these drugs, particularly at
the beginning of therapy. The physician will order periodic blood tests to check the blood’s clotting ability. The
results of these tests will help the physician determine the
proper amount of medication to be taken each day.
Time is required for normal clotting ability to
return after anticoagulant treatment. During this period, patients must observe the same precautions they
observed while taking the drug. The length of time
needed for the blood to return to normal depends on
the type of anticoagulant drug that was taken. The
prescribing physician will advise as to how long the
precautions should be observed.
People who are taking anticoagulant drugs should
tell all physicians, dentists, pharmacists, and other
medical professionals who provide medical treatments
or services to them that they are taking such a medication. They should also carry identification stating that
they are using an anticoagulant drug.
Other prescription drugs or over-the-counter
medicine–especially aspirin–should be not be taken
without the prescribing physician being informed.
Because of the risk of heavy bleeding, anyone who
takes an anticoagulant drug must take care to avoid
injuries. Sports and other potentially hazardous activities should be avoided. Any falls, blows to the body or
head, or other injuries should be reported to a physician,
as internal bleeding may occur without any obvious
symptoms. Special care should be taken in shaving
and in brushing and flossing the teeth. Soft toothbrushes should be used and the flossing should be very
gentle. Electric razors should be used instead of a blade.
Alcohol can change the way anticoagulant drugs
affect the body. Anyone who takes this medicine
should not have more than one to two drinks at any
time and should not drink alcohol every day.
Special conditions
People with specific medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if
they take anticoagulant drugs. Before taking these
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

drugs, the prescribing physician should be informed
about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to anticoagulants in the past should let his or
her physician know before taking the drugs again. The
physician should also be told about any allergies to
beef, pork, or other foods; dyes; preservatives; or other
substances.
PREGNANCY. Anticoagulants may cause many
serious problems if taken during pregnancy. Birth
defects, severe bleeding in the fetus, and other problems that affect the physical or mental development
of the fetus or newborn are possible. The mother may
also experience severe bleeding if she takes anticoagulants during pregnancy, during delivery, or even
shortly after delivery. Women should not take start
taking anticoagulants during pregnancy and should not
become pregnant while taking it. Any woman who
becomes pregnant or suspects that she has become pregnant while taking an anticoagulant should check with
her physician immediately.
BREASTFEEDING. Some anticoagulant drugs may
pass into breast milk. Blood tests can be done on
nursing babies to see whether the drug is causing any
problems. If it is, other medication may be prescribed
to counteract the effects of the anticoagulant drug.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using anticoagulant drugs, people should inform their physician
about any medical problems they have. They should
also let the physician who prescribed the medicine
know if they are being treated by any other medical
physician or dentist. In addition, people who will be
taking anticoagulant drugs should let their physician
know if they have recently had any of the following:


fever lasting more than one to two days



severe or continuing diarrhea



childbirth



heavy or unusual menstrual bleeding



insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device
(IUD)



falls, injuries, or blows to the body or head



any type of surgery, including dental surgery



spinal anesthesia



radiation treatment

USE OF CERTAIN FOODS AND MEDICINES. Many
foods and drugs may affect the way the anticoagulant
drugs work or may increase the risk of side effects.

277

Anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs

should be taken as soon as possible followed by the
regular dose schedule. However, a patient who forgets
to take a missed dose until the next day should not take
the missed dose at all and should not double the next
dose, as this could lead to bleeding. A record of all
missed doses should be kept for the prescribing physician who should be informed at the scheduled visits.

Anticonvulsant drugs

Side effects
The most common minor side effects are bloating or
gas. These problems usually go away as the body adjusts
to the drug and do not require medical treatment.
More serious side effects may occur, especially if
excessive anticoagulant is taken. If any of the following side effects occur, a physician should be notified
immediately:


bleeding gums



sores or white spots in the mouth or throat



unusual bruises or purplish areas on the skin



unexplained nosebleeds



unusually heavy bleeding or oozing from wounds



unexpected or unusually menstrual bleeding



blood in the urine



cloudy or dark urine



painful or difficult urination or sudden decrease in
amount of urine



black, tarry, or bloody stools



coughing up blood



vomiting blood or something that looks like coffee
grounds



constipation



pain or swelling in the stomach or abdomen



back pain



stiff, swollen, or painful joints



painful, bluish or purplish fingers or toes



puffy or swollen eyelids, face, feet, or lower legs



changes in the color of the face



skin rash, itching, or hives



yellow eyes or skin



severe or continuing headache



sore throat and fever, with or without chills



breathing problems or wheezing



tightness in the chest



dizziness



unusual tiredness or weakness



weight gain.

In addition, patients taking anticoagulant drugs
should check with their physicians as soon as possible
if any of these side effects occur:


nausea or vomiting

278



diarrhea



stomach pain or cramps.

Other side effects may occur. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms while taking anticoagulant drugs
should get in touch with his or her physician.

Interactions
Anticoagulants may interact with many other medications. When this happens, the effects of one or both
of the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may
be increased. Anyone who takes anticoagulants should
inform the prescribing physician about other prescription
or nonprescription (over-the-counter medicines) he or she
is taking–even aspirin, laxatives, vitamins, and antacids.
Diet also affects the way anticoagulant drugs work
in the body. A normal, balanced diet should be followed
every day while taking such medication. No dietary
changes should be made without informing first the
prescribing physician, who should also be told of any
illness or other condition interfering with the ability to
eat normally. Diet is a very important consideration
because the amount of vitamin K in the body affects
how anticoagulant drugs work. Dicoumarol and warfarin act by reducing the effects of vitamin K. Vitamin K
is found in meats, dairy products, leafy, green vegetables, and some multiple vitamins and nutritional supplements. For the drugs to work properly, it is best to have
the same amount of vitamin K in the body all the time.
Foods containing vitamin K in the diet should not be
increased or decreased without consulting with the prescribing physician. If the patient takes vitamin supplements, he should check the label to see if it contains
vitamin K. Because vitamin K is also produced by intestinal bacteria, a severe case of diarrhea or the use of
laxatives may also alter a person’s vitamin K levels.

I Anticonvulsant drugs
Definition
Anticonvulsant drugs are medicines used to prevent or treat convulsions (seizures).

Purpose
Anticonvulsant drugs are used to control seizures
in people with epilepsy. Epilepsy is not a single disease—it is a set of symptoms that may have different
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Chronic—A word used to describe a long-lasting
condition. Chronic conditions often develop gradually and involve slow changes.
Epilepsy—A brain disorder with symptoms that
include seizures.
Glaucoma—A condition in which pressure in the
eye is abnormally high. If not treated, glaucoma
may lead to blindness.
Porphyria—A disorder in which porphyrins build
up in the blood and urine.
Porphyrin—A type of pigment found in living
things, such as chlorophyll which makes plants
green or hemoglobin which makes blood red.
Seizure—A sudden attack, spasm, or convulsion.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)—A chronic
disease with many symptoms, including weakness,
fatigue, joint pain, sores on the skin, and problems
with the kidneys, spleen, and other organs.
Withdrawal symptoms—A group of physical or
mental symptoms that may occur when a person
suddenly stops using a drug to which he or she has
become dependent.

causes in different people. The common thread is an
imbalance in the brain’s electrical activity. This imbalance causes seizures that may affect part or all of the
body and may or may not cause a loss of consciousness. Anticonvulsant drugs act on the brain to reduce
the frequency and severity of seizures.
Some cases of epilepsy are brought on by head
injuries, brain tumors or infections, or metabolic problems such as low blood sugar. But in some people
with epilepsy, the cause is not clear.
Anticonvulsant drugs are an important part of the
treatment program for epilepsy. Different kinds of
drugs may be prescribed for different types of seizures.
In addition to taking medicine, patients with epilepsy
should get enough rest, avoid stress, and practice good
health habits.
Some physicians believe that giving the drugs to
children with epilepsy may prevent the condition from
getting worse in later life. However, others say the
effects are the same, whether treatment is started
early or later in life. Determining when treatment
begins depends on the physician and his assessment
of the patient’s symptoms.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Physicians also prescribe certain anticonvulsant
drugs for other conditions, including bipolar disorder
and migraine headaches.

Description
Anticonvulsant drugs may be divided into several
classes. The hydantoins include pheytoin (Dilantin) and
mephenytoin (Mesantoin.) Ther succimides include
ethosuximide (Zarontin) and methsuccimide (Celontin.)
The benzodiazepines, which are better known for their
use as tranquilizers and sedatives, include clonazepam
(Klonopin), clorazepate (Tranxene) and diazepam
(Valium.) There are also a large number of other drugs
which are not related to larger groups. These include
carbamazepine (Tegretol), valproic acid (Depakote,
Depakene) gabapentin (Neurontin), topiramate
(Topamax), felbamate (Felbatol) and several others.
Phenobarbital has been used as an anticonvulsant, and
is still useful for some patients. The drugs are available
only with a physician’s prescription and come in tablet,
capsule, liquid, and ‘‘sprinkle’’ forms.

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
anticonvulsant, its strength, and the type of seizures
for which it is being taken. Check with the physician
who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled
the prescription for the correct dosage.
Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly after
taking it for several weeks or more. Gradually tapering
the dose may reduce the chance of withdrawal effects.
Do not change brands or dosage forms of this
medicine without checking with a pharmacist or physician. If a prescription refill does not look like the
original medicine, check with the pharmacist who
filled the prescription.

Precautions
Patients on anticonvulsant drugs should see a
physician regularly while on therapy, especially during
the first few months. The physician will check to make
sure the medicine is working as it should and will note
unwanted side effects. The physician may also need to
adjust the dosage during this period.
Valproic acid can cause serious liver damage,
especially in the first 6 months of treatment. Children
are particularly at risk, but anyone taking this medicine should see their physician regularly for tests of
liver function and should be alert to symptoms of liver
damage, such as yellow skin and eyes, facial swelling,
279

Anticonvulsant drugs

KEY TERMS

loss of appetite, general feeling of illness, loss of appetite, and vomiting. If liver problems are suspected, call
a physician immediately.
Felbatol has caused serious liver damage and
aplastic anemia, a condition in which the bone marrow stops producing blood cells. Patients taking this
drug should have regular blood counts, and should
stop taking the drug if there are too few red blood
cells.
While taking anticonvulsant drugs, do not start or
stop taking any other medicines without checking with
a physician. The other medicines may affect the way
the anticonvulsant medicine works.
Because anticonvulsant drugs work on the central
nervous system, they may add to the effects of alcohol
and other drugs that slow down the central nervous
system, such as antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy
medicine, sleep aids, other medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants.
Anyone taking anticonvulsant drugs should check with
his or her physician before drinking alcohol or taking
any medicines that slow the central nervous system.
Anticonvulsant drugs may interact with medicines
used during surgery, dental procedures, or emergency
treatment. These interactions could increase the
chance of side effects. Anyone who is taking anticonvulsant drugs should be sure to tell the health care
professional in charge before having any surgical or
dental procedures or receiving emergency treatment.
Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, or
less alert when using these drugs, especially when they
first begin taking them or when their dosage is
increased. Anyone who takes anticonvulsant drugs
should not drive, use machines or do anything else
that might be dangerous until they have found out
how the drugs affect them.
Anticonvulsant drugs may affect the results of
certain medical tests. Before having medical tests, people who take anticonvulsant drugs should make sure
that the medical professional in charge knows what
they are taking.
Children may be more likely to have certain side
effects from anticonvulsant drugs, such as behavior
changes; tender, bleeding, or swollen gums; enlarged
facial features; and excessive hair growth. Problems
with the gums may be prevented by regularly brushing
and flossing, massaging the gums, and having the teeth
cleaned every 3 months whether the patient is a child
or an adult.
Children who take high doses of this medicine for
a long time may have problems in school.
280

Older people may be more sensitive to the effects
of anticonvulsant drugs. This may increase the chance
of side effects and overdoses.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if
they take anticonvulsant drugs. Before taking these
drugs, be sure to let the physician know about any of
these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to anticonvulsant drugs or to tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine (Tofranil) or desipramine
(Norpramin) in the past should let his or her physician
know before taking the drugs again. The physician
should also be told about any allergies to foods,
dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY. Some anticonvulsant drugs taken
during pregnancy may cause bleeding problems in the
mother during delivery and in the baby after delivery.
This problem can be avoided by giving vitamin K to the
mother during delivery and to the baby after birth.

Pregnancy may affect the way the body absorbs
anticonvulsant drugs. Women who are prone to seizures may have more seizures during pregnancy, even
though they are taking their medicine regularly. If this
happens, they should check with their physicians
about whether the dose needs to be increased.
BREASTFEEDING. Some anticonvulsant drugs pass
into breast milk and may cause unwanted effects in babies
whose mothers take the medicine. Women who are
breastfeeding should check with their physicians about
the benefits and risks of using anticonvulsant drugs.
DIABETES. Anticonvulsant drugs may affect blood
sugar levels. Patients with diabetes who notice changes
in the results of their urine or blood tests should check
with their physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using anticonvulsant drugs, people with any of these medical
problems should make sure their physicians are
aware of their conditions:

USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking anticonvulsant drugs with certain other drugs may affect the
way the drugs work or may increase the chance of
side effects.

Side effects
The most common side effects are constipation,
mild nausea or vomiting, and mild dizziness, drowsiness, or lightheadedness. These problems usually go
away as the body adjusts to the drug and do not
require medical treatment. Less common side effects,
such as diarrhea, sleep problems, aching joints or muscles, increased sensitivity to sunlight, increased sweating, hair loss, enlargement of facial features, excessive
hair growth, muscle twitching, and breast enlargement
in males also may occur and do not need medical
attention unless they persist or are troublesome.
Other side effects may need medical attention. If
any of these side effects occur, check with a physician
as soon as possible:

Interactions
Some anticonvulsant drugs should not be taken
within two to three hours of taking antacids or medicine for diarrhea. These medicines may make the
anticonvulsant drugs less effective. Ask the pharmacist or physician for more information.
Birth control pills may not work properly when
anticonvulsant drugs are being taken. To prevent
pregnancy, ask the physician or pharmacist if additional methods of birth control should be used while
taking anticonvulsant drugs.
Anticonvulsant drugs may interact with many
other medicines. When this happens, the effects of
one or both of the drugs may change or the risk of
side effects may be greater. Anyone who takes anticonvulsant drugs should let the physician know all
other medicines he or she is taking. Among the
drugs that may interact with certain anticonvulsant
drugs are:

Description

I Antidepressant drugs
Definition
Antidepressant drugs are medicines that relieve
symptoms of depressive disorders.

Purpose
Depressive disorders may either be unipolar
(depression alone) or bipolar (depression alternating
with periods of extreme excitation). The formal diagnosis requires a cluster of symptoms, lasting at least
two weeks. These symptoms include, but are not limited to, mood changes, insomnia or hypersomnia, and
diminished interest in daily activities. The symptoms
are not caused by any medical condition, drug side
effect, or adverse life event. The condition is severe
enough to cause clinically significant distress or
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
Secondary depression, or depression caused by
unfavorable life events, is normally self limiting, and
may best be treated with cognitive/behavioral therapy
rather than drugs.
282

Antidepressant agents act by increasing the levels
of excitatory neurostransmitters, or nerve cell chemicals
that act as messengers in the brain’s nervous system. In
2003, a report showed that in addition to treating
depression, use of antidepressant drugs may protect
the brain from damage depressive episodes cause to
the hippocampus, the area of the brain involved in
learning and memory. Antidepressant drugs may be
prescribed as a first-line treatment for depression, or
in conjunction with other methods of controlling
depression, such as behavioral therapy and exercise.
The main types of antidepressant drugs in use
today are listed below, though the drugs available
change frequently. For example, in mid-2003, the
manufacturer of Wellbutrin released Wellbutrin XL,
the only once-daily norepinephrine and dopamine
reuptake inhibitor for treating depression in adults.


tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil),
imipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor)



selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs or
serotonin boosters), such as fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft)



monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors), such
as phenelzine (Nardil), and tranylcypromine (Parnate)
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

tetracyclic compounds and atypical antidepressants
which do not fall into any of the above categories

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors maintain
levels of the excitatory neurohormone serotonin in the
brain. They do not alter levels of norepinephrine. These
have become the drugs of choice for a variety of psychiatric disorders, primarily because of their low incidence of severe side effects as compared with other drugs
in this therapeutic class. SSRIs show similar actions and
side effect profiles, but may vary in duration of action.
Tricyclic compounds, identified by their chemical
structure containing three carbon rings, are an older
class of antidepressants. Although generally effective,
they have a high incidence of anticholinergic effects,
notably dry mouth and dry eyes, which can cause
discomfort. They also cause cardiac arrythmias.
Because tricyclics act on both serotonin and norepinephrine, they may have some value in treatment of
patients who fail to respond to SSRIs. Drugs in this
class often are available at low prices, which may be
significant when cost is a major factor in treatment.
They also have been found useful in control of some
neurologic pain syndromes.
Tricyclic antidepressants are similar, but may vary
in severity of side effects, most notably the degree of
sedation and the extent of the anticholinergic effects.
Tetracyclic compounds and atypical antidepressants are chemically distinct from both the major
groups and each other. Although maprotilene (no
brand name, marketed in generic form only) and mirtazepine (Remeron) are similar in chemical structures,
they differ in their balance of activity on serotonine
and norepinephrine levels.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (phenelzine
[Nardil], tranylcypromine [Parnate]) have largely
been supplanted in therapy because of their high risk
of severe adverse effects, most notably severe hypertension. They act by inhibiting the enzyme monoamine
oxidase, which is responsible for the metabolism of the
stimulatory neurohormones norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. The MAOIs are
normally reserved for patients who are resistant to
safer drugs. Two drugs, eldepryl (Carbex, used in
treatment of Parkinson’s disease) and the herb,
St. John’s wort, have some action against monoamine oxidase B, and have shown some value as antidepressants. They do not share the same risks as the
non-selective MAO inhibitors.
All antidepressant agents, regardless of their
structure, have a slow onset of action, typically three
to five weeks. Although adverse effects may be seen as
early as the first dose, significant therapeutic
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

improvement is always delayed. Similarly, the effects
of antidepressants will continue for a similar length of
time after the drugs have been discontinued.

Recommended dosage
Dose varies with the specific drug and patient.
Specialized references or a physician should be consulted.

Precautions
Antidepressants have many significant cautions
and adverse effects. Although a few are listed here,
specific references should be consulted for more complete information.
SSRIs. The most common side effect of SSRIs is
excitation and insomnia. Excitation has been reported
in over 20% of patients, and insomnia in 33%.
Significant weight loss has been frequently reported,
but most commonly in patients who are already
underweight. A 2003 report showed that SSRIs also
increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding. SSRIs may cause some sedation, and patients
should be cautioned not to perform tasks requiring
alertness until they have evaluated the effects of these
drugs. SSRIs are pregnancy category C drugs. In 2003,
a new report demonstrated that late-term (third trimester) use of these drugs could cause neurological symptoms in newborns, including tremor, restlessness and
rigidity. Most SSRIs are excreted in breast milk, and
there have been anecdotal reports of drowsiness in
infants whose mothers were taking SSRIs while
breastfeeding.
Most notably, a joint panel of the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) issued strong warnings
to parents and physicians in 2004 about the risk of
suicidal behavior in children and adolescents taking
SSRIs.
Tricyclic antidepressants. Amoxepine (not marketed by brand, generic available), although a tricyclic
antidepressant rather than a neuroleptic (major tranquilizer), displays some of the more serious effects of
the neuroleptics, including tardive dyskinesias (drug
induced involuntary movements) and neuroleptic
malignant syndrome, a potentially fatal syndrome
with symptoms including high fever, altered mental
status, irregular pulse or blood pressure, and changes
in heart rate. These adverse effects have not been
reported with other tricyclic antidepressants.
The most common adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants are sedation and the anticholinergic
effects, such as dry mouth, dry eyes, and difficult
urination. Alterations in heartbeat also are common,

and may progress to congestive heart failure, stroke,
and sudden death.
Tricyclic antidepressants are in pregnancy categories C or D, although there have been no formal
studies of the drugs on fetal development. There are no
studies of effects on newborns, but some anecdotal
reports of malformations have resulted from animal
studies. The drugs are excreted in breast milk.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The greatest risk
associated with these drugs is a hypertensive crisis
which may be fatal and most often occurs when the
drugs are taken with interacting foods or drugs. More
common adverse reactions may include low blood
pressure and slowing of heartbeat. Sedation and gastrointestinal disturbances also are common. MAOIs
are in pregnancy category C. Safety in breast feeding
has not been established.
Tetracyclics and atypicals. Because these drugs
are individual, there are no group patterns of adverse
reactions. Specific references should be consulted.

Interactions
The antidepressants have many drug interactions,
some severe. Although a few are listed here, specific
references should be consulted for more complete
information.
SSRIs should not be administered with MAOIs.
A wash-out period of about four weeks should be
allowed before switching from one class of drugs to
the other, five weeks if switching from fluoxetine
(Prozac) to an MAOI.
MAOIs have many interactions, however the best
known are those with foods containing the amino acid
tyramine. These include aged cheese, chianti wine, and
many others. Patients and providers should review the
MAOI diet restrictions before using or prescribing
these drugs. Because of the severity of MAOI interactions, all additions to the patient’s drug regimen
should be reviewed with care.
Tricyclic compounds have many interactions, and
specialized references should be consulted.
Specifically, it is best to avoid other drugs with anticholinergic effects. Tricyclics should not be taken with
the antibiotics grepafloxacin and sprafloxacin, since
the combination may cause serious heart arrythmias.
Tricyclic compounds should not be taken with the
gastric acid inhibitor cimetidine (Tagamet), since this
increases the blood levels of the tricyclic compound.
Other acid inhibiting drugs do not share this
interaction.
284

SSRIs interact with a number of other drugs that
act on the central nervous system. Care should be used
in combining these drugs with major or minor tranquilizers, or with anti-epileptic agents such as phenytoin (Dilantin) or carbamazepine (Tegretol). In 2003,
one of the biggest concerns regarding new prescriptions for tricyclic antidepressants was data concerning
overdoses from these drugs. Information in Great
Britain showed that this class of antidepressants was
responsible for more than 90% of all deaths from
antidepressant overdose. Physicians were being
advised to prescribe SSRIs in new patients, but not
to change the course of those who had taken tricyclics
for years with success.

I Antidepressant drugs, SSRI
Definition
Purpose
SSRIs are prescribed primarily to treat mental
depression. Because they are as effective as other
types of antidepressants and have less serious side
effects, SSRIs have become the most commonly prescribed antidepressants for all age groups, including
children and adolescents.
In addition to treating depression, some SSRIs
have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for the treatment of other disorders including:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)



generalized anxiety disorder



panic disorder



social anxiety disorder or social phobia



premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)
premenstrual syndrome (PMS)



post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)



bulimia nervosa, an eating disorder.

KEY TERMS
Citalopram hydrobromide—Celexa; a SSRI that is
highly specific for serotonin reuptake.
Dopamine—A neurotransmitter and the precursor
of norepinephrine.

or

Escitalopram oxalate—Lexapro; a SSRI that is very
similar to Celexa but contains only the active chemical form.
Fluoxetine—Prozac; the first SSRI; marketed as
Sarafem for treating PMDD.

SSRIs often are prescribed for other ‘‘off-label’’
uses including:


various mental disorders including schizophrenia



mania



menopause-related symptoms such as hot flashes



geriatric depression



loss of mental abilities in the elderly



nicotine withdrawal



alcoholism



premature ejaculation

Fluvoxamine—Luvox; a SSRI that is used to treat
obsessive-compulsive disorder as well as other
conditions.
Monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI)—An older
class of antidepressants.
Neurotransmitter—A substance that helps transmit
impulses between two nerve cells or between a
nerve cell and a muscle.
Norepinephrine—A hormone released by nerve
cells and the adrenal medulla that causes constriction of blood vessels.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)—An anxiety disorder characterized by obsessions, such as
recurring thoughts or impulses, and compulsions,
such as repetitive behaviors.
Off-label use—A drug that is prescribed for uses,
periods of time, or at dosages that are not FDAapproved.

The advantages of SSRIs over other types of antidepressants include:


Most SSRIs can be taken in one daily dose as compared with three to six daily pills.



Because they lessen cravings for carbohydrates,
SSRIs usually do not cause weight gain.



Since SSRIs do not appear to affect the cardiovascular system, they can be prescribed for people with
high blood pressure or heart conditions.



Paroxetine hydrochloride—Paxil; a SSRI that is
used to treat mental depression, OCD, and various
other disorders.

Since SSRIs are not particularly dangerous even in high
doses and are unlikely to cause permanent damage if
misused, they may be prescribed for suicidal adults.

Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD)—
Premenstrual syndrome (PMS); symptoms including back and abdominal pain, nervousness and
irritability, headache, and breast tenderness that
occur the week before menstruation.
Serotonin—5-Hydroxytryptamine; a substance
that occurs throughout the body with numerous
effects including neurotransmission.

SSRIs are mood enhancers only in depressed individuals. They have little effect on people who are not
clinically depressed. However some experts believe
that SSRIs are over-prescribed and should be reserved
for those with major disabling depression.

Serotonin syndrome—A group of symptoms caused
by severely elevated serotonin levels in the body.

Description
Types of SSRIs

Sertraline—Zoloft; a SSRI that is used to treat mental depression and a variety of other disorders.

As of 2005, six brand-name SSRIs and generic
equivalents were available in the United States:



Celexa (citalopram hydrobromide) for treating
depression
Lexapro (escitalopram oxalate) for treating depression and generalized anxiety disorder

panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, PMDD, and
PTSD


Prozac and Prozac Weekly (fluoxetine) for treating
depression, OCD, and bulimia nervosa; marketed as
Sarafem for treating PMDD



Zoloft (sertraline) for treating depression, OCD,
panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, PMDD, and
PTSD.

When Prozac first became available in 1988, it was
hailed as a new wonder drug and quickly became the most
popular antidepressant ever prescribed. Many millions
of Americans have taken Prozac and more than 70%
of them claim to have benefited from it. Within a few
years other SSRIs became available and, by 2000, Zoloft
prescriptions outnumbered those for Prozac.
Lexapro is the newest SSRI. Celexa and Lexapro
are very similar, with chemical structures unrelated to
other SSRIs. Celexa is a mixture of two isomers—
forms of the same chemical—whereas Lexapro is the
active isomer alone. They appear to be highly selective
for serotonin, only minimally inhibiting the reuptake
of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. Paxil is structurally unrelated to other SSRIs
and is more selective for serotonin than Luvox,
Prozac, or Zoloft, but less selective than Celexa and
Lexapro. Paxil becomes distributed widely throughout body tissues and the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the circulatory system.
Mode of action
Mental depression is believed to be related to the
low activity of one or more neurotransmitters in the
brain—the chemical messengers that cross the gap or
synapse between nerve cells. Although it is not understood exactly how most SSRIs work, they are designed
to increase the level of serotonin in the brain. This can
reduce the symptoms of depression and other psychological disorders.
Serotonin is released by nerve cells and then—in a
process called reuptake—is reabsorbed by the cells to
be used again. SSRIs interfere with reuptake by blocking the serotonin reuptake sites on the surfaces of
nerve cells, thereby making more serotonin available
for brain activity. Paxil inhibits the transporter molecule that moves serotonin back into the cell. SSRIs are
said to selectively interfere with the reuptake of serotonin, without affecting the uptake or activities of
other neurotransmitters. In contrast, older antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine
oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) affect numerous neurotransmitters, brain cell receptors, and brain processes,
increasing the likelihood of serious side effects.
286

However it is becoming clear that the serotonin
neurotransmitter system is far more complex and widespread throughout the body than was thought initially.
Although serotonin receptors are particularly common
in areas of the brain that control emotion, it is known
now that there are at least six different types of serotonin
receptors that send different signals to different parts of
the brain. Serotonin also appears to affect other neurotransmitter systems—including dopamine—to at least
some extent. Thus increasing the levels of serotonin may
not be the only reason why SSRIs relieve depression.
Effectiveness
SSRIs are not effective for treating anxiety or
depression in 20–40% of patients. However some
research suggests that the use of SSRIs in the early stages
of depression can prevent major depressive disorders.
Although different SSRIs appear to be equally
effective, individuals respond differently to different
SSRIs and side effects may vary. Thus finding the best
SSRI for an individual may be a matter of trial-anderror. It usually takes two to four weeks after starting an
SSRI before symptoms begin to improve. Luvox may
take one to two months for noticeable improvement.
Paxil may take as long as several months, although
sleeping often improves within one or two weeks of
beginning the medication. If there is no response after
a few weeks or if side effects occur, the patient may be
switched to another SSRI. Prozac is the most commonly
prescribed SSRI for children, in part because it is available in liquid form that is easier to swallow.
Although Luvox is the only SSRI that is FDAapproved for use in children—and only for obsessivecompulsive behavior—thousands of young people
have been treated with SSRIs for:


depression



anxiety



OCD



panic



attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

A 2004 study found that among depressed adolescents, 60% improved with Prozac alone, whereas 75%
reported improvement with Prozac combined with
cognitive behavioral therapy.
SSRIs sometimes are prescribed to relieve depression accompanying alcoholism. A recent study found
that, although type A alcoholics responded to Zoloft
in conjunction with a 12-step individual therapy program, type B alcoholics—those with the most severe

Recommended dosage
Usually SSRIs are started with a low dosage that
may be gradually increased. In older adults SSRIs
remain in the body longer than in younger adults.
The blood levels of Paxil can be 70–80% higher in
the elderly as compared with younger patients.
Therefore lower doses usually are prescribed for
older people. Older patients with other medical conditions or who are taking many different drugs also
may need smaller or less frequent doses. The dosage
of an SSRI also varies according to the individual
and the condition that is being treated. SSRIs may be
taken with or without food, on a full or empty
stomach. However taking SSRIs with food or drink
may lessen side effects such as stomach upset or
nausea.
Celexa is supplied as tablets or as an oral solution
equivalent to 2 mg per ml (0.03 oz.), taken once per
day in the morning or evening:


adults: 20 mg per day, increasing to 40 mg if necessary, to a maximum of 60 mg per day



older adults: 20 mg per day to a maximum of 40 mg

Lexapro is supplied as 5-, 10-, or 20-mg tablets or
as a 1 mg per ml (0.03 oz.) liquid. The recommended
dose is 10 mg per day, with a possible increase to 20 mg
per day after at least one week.
Average dosages of Luvox for treating OCD and
depression are:






adults: one 50-mg tablet at bedtime; may be
increased up to a maximum of 300 mg daily; dosages
of more than 100 mg per day should be divided into
two doses, one taken in the evening and one in the
morning
children aged 8–17: initially one 25-mg tablet at
bedtime; may be gradually increased by 25 mg
per day every four to seven days, up to a maximum of 200 mg per day; daily dosages of more
than 50 mg should be divided into two daily
doses.

older adults: 10 mg (5 ml, 0.15 oz.) of oral suspension
or a 10-mg tablet daily, increased to a maximum of
40 mg (20 ml, 0.6 oz.); one 12.5-mg extended-release
tablet daily, increased to a maximum of 50 mg

Because of its sedating effect, Paxil may be taken
in the evening rather than in the morning as usually
recommended. Oral suspensions need to be shaken
well before measuring with a small measuring cup or
measuring spoon. Extended-release tablets should be
swallowed whole, not broken or chewed. Dosages may
be different for treating disorders other than
depression.
Typical dosages of Prozac are:


one 10–20-mg daily capsule or solution taken in the
morning; increased up to as much as 40 mg daily if
there is no improvement in one month, up to an
80-mg maximum



one 90-mg capsule per week of Prozac Weekly once
the depression is under control



one 20-mg capsule of Sarafem per day, taken in the
morning, every day or for only 14 days of a menstrual cycle; maximum of 80 mg per day; Sarafem is
supplied in seven-day blister packs to help keep track
of the days



children: initially one 5–10-mg capsule or solution
per day.

Zoloft is available as capsules, oral solutions, or
tablets:


adults: 50 mg daily, taken in the morning or evening,
up to a maximum of 200 mg daily for severely
depressed individuals



older adults: 12.5–25 mg per day, taken in the morning or evening; may be increased gradually



for treating OCD in children aged 6–12: 25 mg per
day, taken in the morning or evening; may be
increased gradually to a maximum of 200 mg per day



children aged 13–17: initially 50 mg per day, in the
morning or evening, may be increased gradually to a
maximum of 200 mg per day.

Average doses of Paxil for treating depression are:

Zoloft oral concentrate should be mixed with 4 oz
(133 ml) of water, ginger ale, lemon-lime soda, lemonade, or orange juice and taken immediately.

adults: 20 mg (10 ml, 0.3 oz.) of oral suspension, one
20-mg tablet, or one 25-mg extended-release tablet,
once a day in the morning, increased by 10 mg per
week to a maximum of 50 mg—25 ml (0.75 oz.) of
oral suspension—or a 62.5-mg extended-release
tablet

Missed doses of SSRIs are handled differently
depending on the SSRI and the number of doses
per day. An effective SSRI may be prescribed for
six months or more. Some experts recommend continuing on the SSRI indefinitely to prevent the recurrence
of depression.



a recent heart attack



Celexa for at least three days



glaucoma



Luvox for at least 32 hours



Paxil for at least 42 hours



Prozac for up to five weeks



Zoloft for at least three to five days

SSRI use during pregnancy may not be safe, particularly during the third trimester. Exposure of fetuses
to Celexa and other SSRIs during the late third trimester have led to very serious complications, including
serotonin syndrome—a condition in which high serotonin levels cause severe problems. Symptoms in a newborn may be the result of a direct toxic effect of the
SSRI or withdrawal from the drug. SSRIs pass into
breast milk and may negatively affect a baby.
Suicidal tendencies
A possible link between SSRIs and suicide
attempts in depressed adults remains controversial.
Three studies in early 2005 drew conflicting conclusions concerning an association between suicidal
behavior and the use of SSRIs. However a February
2005 study found a close correlation between the dramatic decrease in suicides in the United States and
Europe and the introduction of SSRIs.
In October 2004, the FDA concluded that antidepressants, including SSRIs, increased the risk of
suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children and adolescents who suffered from depression and other psychiatric disorders. They recommended extreme
caution in prescribing SSRIs for children. In the last
three months of 2004, SSRI prescriptions for children
and adolescents fell by 10%.
Symptoms that may lead to suicidal tendencies
can develop very suddenly in children and adolescents
taking SSRIs; they may include:
288

Withdrawal

SSRIs can cause what the manufacturers refer to
as ‘‘discontinuation syndrome’’ when the medication
is stopped. Since this occurs most often when the drug
is stopped abruptly, usually the dose is gradually
reduced before stopping the drug completely. The
occurrence of discontinuation syndrome depends on
the SSRI, the dosage, and the length of time that the
drug was used. Paxil appears to induce more serious
withdrawal symptoms than other SSRIs. Symptoms of
Paxil withdrawal appear within 1 to 10 days of stopping the drug. Because of its long half-life in the body,
Prozac rarely causes withdrawal symptoms, although
symptoms have been known to appear within 5 to 42
days of stopping Prozac.
Withdrawal symptoms may include:


generally feeling sick



Most common side effects disappear as the body
adjusts to the drug. Nausea may be relieved by taking
the medication with meals or temporarily dividing the
dose in half.



chest pain



confusion

Although withdrawal symptoms usually wear off,
in some patients some symptoms appear to continue
indefinitely.

Certain side effects occur more frequently depending on the SSRI:


Side effects of Celexa usually are mild and disappear
as the body adjusts.



Luvox and Zoloft are more likely to cause gastrointestinal upset, including stomach irritation, nausea,
and diarrhea.



Paxil is more likely to cause dry mouth, constipation,
and drowsiness. Paxil is significantly more sedating
than other SSRIs, which may benefit patients with
insomnia.



The most common side effect of Prozac is nausea
during the first two weeks on the drug; nervousness
and anxiety also are common with Prozac.

Other precautions
Other precautions concerning SSRIs include:


a 50% chance that an episode of depression will recur
at some point after stopping the drug



a 90% risk of recurrence following two episodes of
depression



reports of patients developing tolerance to an SSRI,
requiring increased dosages for effectiveness

Sexual side effects
Any SSRI can affect sexual interest or performance. Side effects include increased or, more often,
decreased sexual interest, difficulty reaching orgasm
or ejaculation, and impotence.

sexual problems were very rare side effects of
SSRIs, most patients in clinical trials were never

asked specifically about sex and were reluctant to
raise the issue. After a few years it became apparent
that sexual problems were commonplace among
SSRI users, affecting as many as 70%. Among
men taking Paxil, 23% report problems with ejaculation. Between 40% and 70% of those taking
Prozac report negative sexual side effects, especially
loss of interest.
Less common or rare side effects

Interactions
SSRIs interact with many other drugs, often in
similar ways. Alcohol may increase SSRI-induced
drowsiness and should not be used when taking some
SSRIs. Luvox appears to cause the most serious drug
interactions, whereas Celexa has relatively few interactions. A combination of Luvox and Clozaril can cause
low blood pressure and seizures.
The interaction of SSRIs with MAOIs can be
fatal. In addition to antidepressant MAOIs, the
antibiotic linezolid (Zyvox) is an MAOI. There
must be at least a two-week interval between stopping one drug and starting the other. There should
be at least a three-week interval between an MAOI
and either Paxil or Zoloft, if either type of antidepressant was taken for more than three months.
Because of its long half-life in the body, it is necessary to wait five to six weeks after stopping Prozac
before starting on an MAOI.
Some of the drugs that can interact negatively
with SSRIs include:

Some SSRIs may cause higher blood levels of
other medications including:


alprazolam (Xanax and others)



anticoagulants or blood-thinners such as warfarin

levels dramatically

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Margaret Alic, Ph.D.

I Antidepressants, tricyclic
Definition
Tricyclic antidepressants are medicines that
relieve mental depression.

Purpose
Since their discovery in the 1950s, tricyclic antidepressants have been used to treat mental depression.
Like other antidepressant drugs, they reduce symptoms
such as extreme sadness, hopelessness, and lack of
energy. Some tricyclic antidepressants are also used
to treat bulimia, cocaine withdrawal, panic disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorders, certain types of
chronic pain, and bed-wetting in children.

Description
Named for their three-ring chemical structure,
tricyclic antidepressants work by correcting chemical
imbalances in the brain. But because they also affect
other chemicals throughout the body, these drugs may
produce many unwanted side effects.
Tricyclic antidepressants are available only with a
physician’s prescription and are sold in tablet, capsule,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

liquid, and injectable forms. Some commonly used
tricyclic antidepressants are amitriptyline (Elavil),
desipramine (Norpramin), imipramine (Tofranil),
nortriptyline (Pamelor), and protriptyline (Vivactil).
Different drugs in this family have different effects,
and physicians can choose the drug that best fits the
patient’s symptoms. For example, a physician might
prescribe Elavil for a person with depression who has
trouble sleeping, because this drug is more likely to
make people feel calm and sleepy. Other tricyclic antidepressants might be more appropriate for depressed
people with low energy.

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on many factors, including the patient’s age, weight, general health
and symptoms. The type of tricyclic antidepressant
and its strength also must be considered. Check with
the physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the correct dosage.
Always take tricyclic antidepressants exactly as
directed. Never take larger or more frequent doses,
and do not take the drug for longer than directed.
Do not stop taking the medicine just because it does
not seem to be working. Several weeks may be needed
for its effects to be felt. Visit the physician as often as
recommended so that the physician can check to see if
the drug is working and to note for side effects.
Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly after
taking it for several weeks or more. Gradually tapering the dose may be necessary to reduce the chance of
withdrawal symptoms.
Taking this medicine with food may prevent upset
stomach.

Precautions
The effects of this medicine may continue for three
to seven days after patients stop taking it. All precautions should be observed during this period, as well as
throughout treatment with tricyclic antidepressants.
Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded,
when taking these drugs. The drugs may also cause
blurred vision. Anyone who takes these drugs should
not drive, use machines or do anything else that might
be dangerous until they have found out how the drugs
affect them.
Because tricyclic antidepressants work on the central nervous system, they may add to the effects of
alcohol and other drugs that cause drowsiness, such
as antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine,

sleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some
pain relievers, and muscle relaxants. Anyone taking
tricyclic antidepressants should check with his or her
physician before drinking alcohol or taking any drugs
that cause drowsiness.
These medicines make some people feel lightheaded, dizzy, or faint when they get up after sitting
or lying down. To lessen the problem, get up gradually
and hold onto something for support if possible.
Tricyclic antidepressants may interact with medicines used during surgery, dental procedures, or emergency treatment. These interactions could increase the
chance of side effects. Anyone who is taking tricyclic
antidepressants should be sure to tell the health care
professional in charge before having any surgical or
dental procedures or receiving emergency treatment.
These drugs may also change the results of medical tests. Before having medical tests, anyone taking
this medicine should alert the health care professional
in charge.
This medicine may increase sensitivity to sunlight.
Even brief exposure to sun can cause a severe sunburn or
a rash. While being treated with this tricyclic antidepressants, avoid being in direct sunlight, especially
between 10 A.M. and 3 P.M.; wear a hat and tightly
woven clothing that covers the arms and legs; use a
sunscreen with a skin protection factor (SPF) of at
least 15; protect the lips with a sun block lipstick; and
do not use tanning beds, tanning booths, or sunlamps.
Tricyclic antidepressants may cause dry mouth. To
temporarily relieve the discomfort, chew sugarless
gum, suck on sugarless candy or ice chips, or use saliva
substitutes, which come in liquid and tablet forms and
are available without a prescription.
Children and older people are especially sensitive to
the effects of tricyclic antidepressants. This increased
sensitivity may increase the chance of side effects.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if
they take tricyclic antidepressants. Before taking these
drugs, be sure to let the physician know about any of
these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to tricyclic antidepressants or to carbamazepine
(Tegretol), maprotiline (Ludiomil), or trazodone
(Desyrel) in the past should let his or her physician
know before taking tricyclic antidepressants. The physician should also be told about any allergies to foods,
dyes, preservatives, or other substances.

I Antidiabetic drugs
Definition
Antidiabetic drugs are medicines that help control
blood sugar levels in people with diabetes mellitus
(sugar diabetes).

Purpose
Diabetes may be divided into type I and type II,
formerly termed juvenile onset or insulin-dependent,
and maturity onset or non insulin-dependent. Type I is
caused by a deficiency of insulin production, while
type II is characterized by insulin resistance.
296

Treatment of type I diabetes is limited to insulin
replacement, while type II diabetes is treatable by a
number of therapeutic approaches. Many cases of insulin resistance are asymptomatic due to normal increases
in insulin secretion, and others may be controlled by
diet and exercise. Drug therapy may be directed toward
increasing insulin secretion, increasing insulin sensitivity, or increasing insulin penetration of the cells.

Description
Antidiabetic drugs may be subdivided into six
groups: insulin, sufonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, biguanides, meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones.
Insulin (Humulin, Novolin) is the hormone responsible for glucose utilization. It is effective in both types
of diabetes, since, even in insulin resistance, some sensitivity remains and the condition can be treated with
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Sulfonylureas (chlorpropamide [Diabinese], tolazamide [Tolinase], glipizide [Glucotrol] and others) act
by increasing insulin release from the beta cells of the
pancrease. Glimepiride (Amaryl), a member of this
class, appears to have a useful secondary action in
increasing insulin sensitivity in peripheral cells.
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose [Precose],
miglitol [Glyset]) do not enhance insulin secretion.
Rather, they inhibit the conversion of disaccharides and
complex carbohydrates to glucose. This mechanism does
not prevent conversion, but only delays it, reducing the
peak blood glucose levels. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors
are useful for either monotherapy or in combination
therapy with sulfonylureas or other hypoglycemic agents.
Metformin (Glucophage) is the only available member of the biguanide class. Metformin decreases hepatic
(liver) glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake
and use. Metformin may be used as monotherapy
(alone), or in combination therapy with a sulfonylurea.
There are two members of the meglitinide class:
repaglinide (Prandin) and nateglitinide (Starlix). The
mechanism of action of the meglitinides is to stimulate
insulin production. This activity is both dose dependent
and dependent on the presence of glucose, so that the
drugs have reduced effectiveness in the presence of low
blood glucose levels. The meglitinides may be used alone,
or in combination with metformin. The manufacturer
warns that nateglitinide should not be used in combination with other drugs that enhance insulin secretion.
Rosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos)
are members of the thiazolidinedione class. They act
by both reducing glucose production in the liver, and
increasing insulin dependent glucose uptake in muscle
cells. They do not increase insulin production. These
drugs may be used in combination with metformin or
a sulfonylurea.

Recommended dosage
Dosage must be highly individualized for all antidiabetic agents and is based on blood glucose levels
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

which must be taken regularly. Patients should review
specific literature that comes with antidiabetic medications for complete dosage information.

Precautions
Insulin. The greatest short term risk of insulin is
hypoglycemia, which may be the result of either a
direct overdose or an imbalance between insulin injection and level of exercise and diet. This also may occur
in the presence of other conditions which reduce the
glucose load, such as illness with vomiting and diarrhea. Treatment is with glucose in the form of glucose
tablets or liquid, although severe cases may require
intravenous therapy. Allergic reactions and skin reactions also may occur. Insulin is classified as category B
in pregnancy, and is considered the drug of choice for
glucose control during pregnancy. Insulin glargine
(Lantus), an insulin analog which is suitable for
once-daily dosing, is classified as category C, because
there have been reported changes in the hearts of newborns in animal studies of this drug. The reports are
essentially anecdotal, and no cause and effect relationship has been determined. Insulin is not recommended
during breast feeding because either low or high
doses of insulin may inhibit milk production. Insulin
administered orally is destroyed in the GI tract, and
represents no risk to the newborn.
Sulonylureas. All sulfonylurea drugs may cause
hypoglycemia. Most patients become resistant to these
drugs over time, and may require either dose adjustments or a switch to insulin. The list of adverse reactions
is extensive, and includes central nervous system problems and skin reactions, among others. Hematologic
reactions, although rare, may be severe and include
aplastic anemia and hemolytic anemia. The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been associated
with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared
with treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. The
sulfonylureas are classified as category C during pregnancy, based on animal studies, although glyburide has
not shown any harm to the fetus and is classified as
category B. Because there may be significant alterations
in blood glucose levels during pregnancy, it is recommended that patients be switched to insulin. These drugs
have not been fully studied during breast feeding, but it
is recommended that because their presence in breast
milk might cause hypoglycemia in the newborn, breast
feeding be avoided while taking sulfonylureas.
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are generally well
tolerated, and do not cause hypoglycemia. The most
common adverse effects are gastrointestinal problems,
including flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.
297

Antidiabetic drugs

larger doses of insulin. Most insulins are now produced
by recombinant DNA techniques, and are chemically
identical to natural human insulin. Isophane insulin
suspension, insulin zinc suspension, and other formulations are intended to extend the duration of insulin
action, and permit glucose control over longer periods
of time. In 2003, research suggested that inhaled forms
of insulin offered advantages to injected types, but
further study was needed on its long-term effects on
the lungs and cost-effectiveness.

Antidiarrheal drugs

These drugs are classified as category B in pregnancy.
Although there is no evidence that the drugs are harmful to the fetus, it is important that rigid blood glucose
control be maintained during pregnancy, and pregnant women should be switched to insulin. Alphaglucosidase inhibitors may be excreted in small
amounts in breast milk, and it is recommended that
the drugs not be administered to nursing mothers.
Metformin causes gastrointestinal (stomach and
digestive) reactions in about a third of patients. A rare,
but very serious, reaction to metformin is lactic acidosis, which is fatal in about 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis occurs in patients with multiple medical problems,
including renal (kidney-related) insufficiency. The risk
may be reduced with careful renal monitoring, and
careful dose adjustments to metformin. Metformin is
category B during pregnancy. There have been no
carefully controlled studies of the drug during pregnancy, but there is no evidence of fetal harm from
animal studies. It is important that rigid blood glucose
control be maintained during pregnancy, and pregnant women should be switched to insulin. Animal
studies show that metformin is excreted in milk. It is
recommended that metformin not be administered to
nursing mothers.
Meglitinides. These drugs are generally well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. The drugs are classified as category C during
pregnancy, based on fetal abnormalities in rabbits
given about 40 times the normal human dose. It is
important that rigid blood glucose control be maintained during pregnancy, and pregnant women
should be switched to insulin. It is not known
whether the meglitinides are excreted in human
milk, but it is recommended that these drugs not be
given to nursing mothers.
Thiazolidinediones. These drugs were generally
well tolerated in early trials, but they are structurally
related to an earlier drug, troglitazone, which was
associated with liver function problems. However, in
2003, researchers reported that these drugs, which are
used by more than 6 million Americans, may lead to
serious side effects. Research showed that after one to
16 months of therapy with pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, some patients developed serious edema and signs
of congestive heart failure. Additional studies were
underway in late 2003 to determine how these drugs
caused fluid build-up and if the symptoms occurred
more frequently in certain age groups. The mean age
of patients in the 2003 study was 69 years.
It is strongly recommended that all patients treated
with pioglitazone or rosiglitazone have regular liver
298

function monitoring. The drugs are classified as pregnancy category C, based on evidence of inhibition of
fetal growth in rats given more than four times the
normal human dose. It is important that rigid blood
glucose control be maintained during pregnancy, and
pregnant women should be switched to insulin. It is not
known whether the thiazolidinediones are excreted in
human milk, however they have been identified in the
milk of lactating rats. It is recommended that these
drugs not be administered to nursing mothers.

Interactions
The sulfonylureas have a particularly long list of
drug interactions, several of which may be severe.
Patients should review specific literature for these drugs.
The actions of oral hypoglycemic agents may be
strengthened by highly protein bound drugs, including
NSAIDs, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol,
coumarins, probenecid, MAOIs, and beta blockers.
The literature that accompanies each medication
should list possible drug-drug or food-drug interactions.

I Antidiarrheal drugs
Definition
Antidiarrheal drugs are medicines that relieve
diarrhea.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Colitis—Inflammation of the colon (large bowel).
Dehydration—Excessive loss of water from the
body.
Enzyme—A type of protein, produced in the body,
that brings about or speeds up chemical reactions.
Nutrient—A food substance that provides energy or
is necessary for growth and repair. Examples of nutrients are vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, and
proteins.

Purpose
Antidiarrheal drugs help control diarrhea and some
of the symptoms that go along with it. An average,
healthy person has anywhere from three bowel movements a day to three a week, depending on that person’s
diet. Normally the stool (the material that is passed in a
bowel movement) has a texture something like clay.
With diarrhea, bowel movements may be more frequent,
and the texture of the stool is thin and sometimes watery.
Diarrhea is not a disease, but a symptom of some
other problem. The symptom may be caused by eating
or drinking food or water that is contaminated with
bacteria, viruses, or parasites, or by eating something
that is difficult to digest. People who have trouble
digesting lactose (milk sugar), for example, may get
diarrhea if they eat dairy products. Some cases of
diarrhea are caused by stress, while others are brought
on by taking certain medicines.

Description
Antidiarrheal drugs work in several ways. The
drug loperamide, found in Imodium A-D, for example,
slows the passage of stools through the intestines. This
allows more time for water and salts in the stools to be
absorbed back into the body. Adsorbents, such as attapulgite (found in Kaopectate) pull diarrhea-causing
substances from the digestive tract. However, they
may also pull out substances that the body needs,
such as enzymes and nutrients. Bismuth subsalicylate,
the ingredient in Pepto-Bismol, decreases the secretion
of fluid into the intestine and inhibits the activity of
bacteria. It not only controls diarrhea, but relieves the
cramps that often accompany diarrhea.
These medicines come in liquid, tablet, caplet, and
chewable tablet forms and can be bought without a
physician’s prescription.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The dose depends on the type of antidiarrheal
drug. Read and follow the directions on the product
label. For questions about dosage, check with a physician or pharmacist. Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do not take the drug for longer than
directed.

Precautions
Diarrhea usually improves within 24-48 hours. If
the problem lasts longer or if it keeps coming back,
diarrhea could be a sign of a more serious problem.
Anyone who has any of the symptoms listed below
should get medical attention as soon as possible:


diarrhea that lasts more than two days or gets worse



fever



blood in the stool



vomiting



cramps or tenderness in the abdomen



signs of dehydration, such as decreased urination,
dizziness or lightheadedness, dry mouth, increased
thirst, or wrinkled skin

Do not use antidiarrheal drugs for more than two
days unless told to do so by a physician.
Severe, long-lasting diarrhea can lead to dehydration. In such cases, lost fluids and salts, such as
calcium, sodium, and potassium, must be replaced.
People older than 60 should not use attapulgite
(Kaopectate, Donnagel, Parepectolin), but may use
other kinds of antidiarrheal drugs. However, people
in this age group may be more likely to have side
effects, such as severe constipation, from bismuth subsalicylate. Ask the pharmacist for more information.
Bismuth subsalicylate may cause the tongue or the
stool to temporarily darken. This is harmless.
However, do not confuse this harmless darkening of
the stool with the black, tarry stools that are a sign of
bleeding in the intestinal tract.
Children with flu or chicken pox should not be
given bismuth subsalicylate. It can lead to Reye’s syndrome, a life-threatening condition that affects the
liver and central nervous system. To be safe, never
give bismuth subsalicylate to a child under 16 years
without consulting a physician. Children may have
unpredictable reactions to other antidiarrheal drugs.
Loperamide should not be given to children under six
years and attapulgite should not be given to children
under three years unless directed by a physician.

KEY TERMS

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) test

Anyone who has a history of liver disease or who
has been taking antibiotics should check with his or her
physician before taking the antidiarrheal drug loperamide. A physician should also be consulted before
anyone with acute ulcerative colitis or anyone who has
been advised to avoid constipation uses the drug.
Loperamide should not be used by people whose
diarrhea is caused by certain infections, such as salmonella or shigella. To be safe, check with a physician
before using this drug.
Anyone who has a medical condition that causes
weakness should check with a physician about the best
way to treat diarrhea.
Special conditions
Before taking antidiarrheal drugs, be sure to let
the physician know about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions
to aspirin or other drugs containing salicylates should
check with a physician before taking bismuth subsalicylate. Anyone who has developed a rash or other
unusual reactions after taking loperamide should not
take that drug again without checking with a physician.
The physician should also be told about any allergies to
foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY AND BREASTFEEDING. Women who
are pregnant or breastfeeding should check with their
physicians before using antidiarrheal drugs. They should
also ask advice on how to replace lost fluids and salts.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using antidiarrheal drugs, people with any of these medical problems should make sure their physicians are aware of
their conditions:


dysentery



gout



hemophilia or other bleeding problems



kidney disease



stomach ulcer



severe colitis



USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking antidiarrheal
drugs with certain other drugs may affect the way the
drugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.

Side effects
The most common side effects of attapulgite
are constipation, bloating, and fullness. Bismuth
subsalicylate may cause ringing in the ears, but
300

that side effect is rare. Possible side effects from
loperamide include skin rash, constipation, drowsiness, dizziness, tiredness, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, and swelling, pain, and discomfort in the
abdomen. Some of these symptoms are the same
as those that occur with diarrhea, so it may be
difficult to tell if the medicine is causing the problems. Children may be more sensitive than adults
to certain side effects of loperamide, such as drowsiness and dizziness.
Other rare side effects may occur with any antidiarrheal medicine. Anyone who has unusual symptoms after taking an antidiarrhea drug should get in
touch with his or her physician.

Interactions
Attapulgite can decrease the effectiveness of other
medicines taken at the same time. Changing the times
at which the other medicines are taken may be necessary. Check with a physician or pharmacist to work
out the proper dose schedule.
Bismuth subsalicylate should not be taken with
aspirin or any other medicine that contains salicylate.
This drug may also interact with other drugs, such as
blood thinners (warfarin, for example), methotrexate,
the antigout medicine probenecid, and the antidiabetes drug tolbutamide. In addition, bismuth subsalicylate may interact with any drug that interacts with
aspirin. Anyone taking these drugs should check with
a physician or pharmacist before taking bismuth
subsalicylate.

hormone (ADH)
I Antidiuretic
test
Definition
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) test, also called the
Vasopressin test, is a test for the antidiuretic hormone,
which is released from the pituitary gland and acts on
the kidneys to increase their reabsorption of water into
the blood.

Purpose
An ADH test is used to aid in the diagnosis of
diabetes insipidus or the syndrome of inappropriate
ADH called SIADH.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diabetes insipidus—A metabolic disorder in which
the pituitary gland produces inadequate amounts of
antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or the kidneys are unable
to respond to release of the hormone. Primary symptoms are excessive urination and constant thirst.
Pituitary gland—The pituitary gland is sometimes
referred to as the ‘‘master gland.’’ As the most important of the endocrine glands (glands which release
hormones directly into the bloodstream), it regulates
and controls not only the activities of other endocrine glands but also many body processes.

The test requires collection of a blood sample. The
patient must be fasting (nothing to eat or drink) for
12 hours, be adequately hydrated, and limit physical
activity for 10-12 hours before the test.

Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include
slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or
feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma
(blood accumulating under the puncture site).

Normal results
ADH normal ranges are laboratory-specific but
can range from 1-5 pg/ml or 1.5 ng/L (SI units).

Precautions
Certain drugs can either increase or decrease
ADH levels. Drugs that increase ADH levels include
acetaminophen, barbiturates, cholinergic agents, estrogen, nicotine, oral hypoglycemia agents, some diuretics
(e.g., thiazides), cyclophosphamide, narcotics, and tricyclic antidepressants. Drugs that decrease ADH levels
include alcohol, beta-adrenergic agents, morphine
antagonists, and phenytoin (Dilantin).

Description
The purpose of ADH is to control the amount of
water reabsorbed by the kidneys. Water is continually being taken into the body in food and drink, as
well as being produced by chemical reactions in cells.
Water is also continually lost in urine, sweat, feces,
and in the breath as water vapor. ADH release helps
maintain the optimum amount of water in the body
when there is an increase in the concentration of the
blood serum or a decrease in blood volume. Physical
stress, surgery, and high levels of anxiety can also
stimulate ADH.
Various factors can affect ADH production,
thereby disturbing the body’s water balance. For
example, alcohol consumption reduces ADH production by direct action on the brain, resulting in a
temporarily increased production of urine. This may
also occur in diabetes insipidus, when the pituitary
gland produces insufficient ADH, or rarely, when the
kidneys fail to respond to ADH. The reverse effect of
water retention can result from temporarily
increased ADH production after a major operation
or accident. Water retention may also be caused by
the secretion of ADH by some tumors, especially of
the lung.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Abnormal results
Patients who are dehydrated, who have a decreased
amount of blood in the body (hypovolemia), or who are
undergoing severe physical stress (e.g., trauma, pain or
prolonged mechanical ventilation) may exhibit increased
ADH levels. Patients who are overly hydrated or who
have an increased amount of blood in the body (hypervolemia) may have decreased ADH levels.
Other conditions that cause increased levels
include SIADH, central nervous system tumors or
infection, or pneumonia.

Systemic antifungal drugs are medicines taken by
mouth or by injection to treat deep infections caused
by a fungus.

KEY TERMS

Antifungal drugs, systemic

Description

KEY TERMS
Elixir—A sweetened liquid that contains alcohol,
water, and medicine.
Fetus—A developing baby inside the womb.
Fungus—A unicellular to filamentous organism
that causes parasitic infections.
Ointment—A thick substance that contains medicine and is meant to be spread on the skin, or if an
ophthalmic ointment, in the eye.
Systemic—A term used to describe a medicine
that has effects throughout the body, as opposed
to topical drugs that work on the skin. Most medicines that are taken by mouth or by injection are
systemic drugs.

Purpose
Systemic antifungal drugs are used to treat
infections in various parts of the body that are
caused by a fungus. A fungus is an organism that
can be either one-celled or filamentous. Unlike a
plant, which makes its own food, or an animal,
which eats plants or other animals, a fungus survives by invading and living off other living things.
Fungi thrive in moist, dark places, including some
parts of the body.
Fungal infections can either be systemic, meaning
that the infection is deep, or topical (dermatophytic),
meaning that the infection is superficial and occurs on
the skin. Additionally, yeast infections can affect the
mucous membranes of the body. Fungal infections on
the skin are usually treated with creams or ointments
(topical antifungal drugs). However, systemic infections, yeast infections or topical infections that do
not clear up after treatment with creams or ointments
may need to be treated with systemic antifungal drugs.
These drugs are used, for example, to treat common
fungal infections such as tinea (ringworm), which
occurs on the skin or candidiasis (a yeast infection,
also known as trush), which can occur in the throat,
in the vagina, or in other parts of the body. They are
also used to treat other deep fungal infections such as
histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and aspergillosis, which
can affect the lungs and other organs. They are sometimes used to prevent or treat fungal infections in
people whose immune systems are weakened, such as
bone marrow or organ transplant patients and people
with AIDS.
302

Antifungal drugs are categorized depending on
their route or site of action, their mechanism of action
and their chemical nature.
Systemic antifungal drugs, such as capsofungin
(Cancidas), flucytosine, fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole (Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), and
miconazole (Monistat I.V.) are available only by prescription. They are available in tablet, capsule, liquid,
and injectable forms.

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
antifungal drug and the nature and extent of fungal
infection being treated. Doses may also be different for
different patients. The prescribing physician or the
pharmacist can provide dosage information.
Systemic antifungal drugs must be taken exactly as
directed. Itraconazole and ketoconazole should be
taken with food.
Fungal infections can take a long time to clear up,
so it may be necessary to take the medication for several
months, or even for a year or longer. It is very important to keep taking the medicine for as long as the
physician says to take it, even if symptoms seem to
improve. If the drug is stopped too soon, the symptoms
may return.
Systemic antifungal drugs work best when their
amount is kept constant in the body, meaning that
they have to be taken regularly, at the same time
every day, and without missing any doses.
Patients taking the liquid form of ketoconazole
should use a specially marked medicine spoon or other
medicine measuring device to make sure they take the
correct amount. A regular household teaspoon may
not hold the right amount of medicine. Ask the pharmacists about ways to accurately measure the dose of
these drugs.

Precautions
If symptoms do not improve within a few weeks,
the prescribing physician should be informed.
While taking this medicine, regular medical visits
should be scheduled. The physician needs to keep
checking for side effects throughout the antifungal
therapy.
Some people feel drowsy or dizzy while taking
systemic antifungal drugs. Anyone who takes these
drugs should not drive, use machines or do anything
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Liver problems, stomach problems and other problems may occur in people who drink alcohol while
taking systemic antifungal drugs. Alcohol and prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) drugs
that contain alcohol should be avoided while taking
antifungal drugs. (Medicines that may contain alcohol
include some cough syrups, tonics, and elixirs.)
Alcohol should be avoided for at least a day after
taking an antifungal drug.
The antifungal drug ketoconazole may make the
eyes unusually sensitive to light. Wearing sunglasses
and avoiding exposure to bright light may help.

ineffective. For people with insufficient stomach acid,
it may help to take the medicine with an acidic drink,
such as a cola. The patient’s health care provider can
suggest the best way to take the medicine.
Before using systemic antifungal drugs, people
with any of these medical problems should also make
sure their physicians are aware of their conditions:


current or past alcohol abuse



liver disease



kidney disease

USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking systemic antifungal drugs with certain other drugs may affect the
way the drugs work or may increase the chance of side
effects.

Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who
are taking certain other medicines can have problems if they take systemic antifungal drugs.
Before taking these drugs, the prescribing physician
should be informed about any of the following
conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to systemic antifungal drugs in the past should
let his or her physician know about the problem before
taking the drugs again. The physician should also be
told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives,
or other substances.

Side effects
Fluconazole
Although rare, severe allergic reactions to this
medicine have been reported. Call a physician immediately if any of these symptoms develop after taking
fluconazole (Diflucan):


hives, itching, or swelling



breathing or swallowing problems



sudden drop in blood pressure



diarrhea



abdominal pain

PREGNANCY. In laboratory studies of animals,

systemic antifungal drugs have caused birth defects
and other problems in the mother and fetus.
Studies have not been done on pregnant women,
so it is not known whether these drugs cause similar effects in people. Women who are pregnant or
who plan to become pregnant should check with
their physicians before taking systemic antifungal
drugs. Any woman who becomes pregnant while
taking these drugs should let her physician know
immediately.
BREASTFEEDING. Systemic antifungal drugs pass
into breast milk. Women who are breastfeeding
should check with their physicians before using systemic antifungal drugs.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. People who have
medical conditions that deplete stomach acid (achlorhydria) or decrease stomach acid (hypochlorhydria)
should be sure to inform their physicians about their
condition before they use a systemic antifungal drug.
These drugs are not active in their natural form, but
must be converted to the active form by an acid. If

how the drugs affect them.

Antifungal drugs, topical

The most common minor side effects of systemic
antifungal drugs are constipation, diarrhea, nausea,
vomiting, headache, drowsiness, dizziness, and flushing of the face or skin. These problems usually go
away as the body adjusts to the drug and do not
require medical treatment. Less common side effects,
such as menstrual problems in women, breast enlargement in men, and decreased sexual ability in men
also may occur and do not need medical attention
unless they do not improve in a reasonable amount
of time.
More serious side effects are not common, but
may occur. If any of the following side effects occur,
check with the physician who prescribed the medicine
immediately:

birth control pills



male hormones (androgens)



female hormones (estrogens)



medicine for other types of infections



antihistamines



muscle relaxants



medicine for diabetes, such as tolbutamide (Orinase),
glyburide (DiaBeta), and glipizide (Glucotrol)



blood-thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin)

The list above does not include every drug that
may interact with systemic antifungal drugs. Be sure
to check with a physician or pharmacist before combining systemic antifungal drugs with any other
medicine.

Other rare side effects are possible. Anyone who
has unusual symptoms after taking systemic antifungal drugs should get in touch with his or her physician.

Interactions
Serious and possibly life-threatening side effects
can result if the oral forms of itraconazole or ketoconazole or the injectable form of miconazole are taken
with certain drugs. Do not take those types of
systemic antifungal drugs with any of the following
drugs unless the physician approves of the therapy:


astemizole (Hismanal)



cisapride (Propulsid)



antacids



theophylline-containing anti-wheezing medications

Taking an acid blocker such as cimetidine
(Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid),
omeprazole (Prilosec), or ranitidine (Zantac) at the
same time as a systemic antifungal drug may prevent
the antifungal drug from working properly. For best
results, take the acid blocker at least 2 hours after
taking the antifungal drug.
In addition, systemic antifungal drugs may interact with many other medicines. When this happens,
the effects of one or both of the drugs may change or
the risk of side effects may be greater. Anyone who
takes systemic antifungal drugs should inform the prescribing physician about all other prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines he or she is

I Antifungal drugs, topical
Definition
Topical antifungal drugs are medicines applied to
the skin to treat skin infections caused by a fungus.

Purpose
Dermatologic fungal infections are usually
described by their location on the body: tinea pedis
(infection of the foot), tinea unguium (infection of the
nails), tinia capitis (infection of the scalp.) Three types
of fungus are involved in most skin infections:
Trichophyton, Epidermophyton, and Microsporum.
Mild infections are usually susceptible to topical
therapy, however severe or resistant infections may
require systemic treatment.

Description
There are a large number of drugs currently
available in topical form for fungal infections.
Other than the imidazoles, (miconazole [Micatin,
Miconazole], clotrimazole [Lotrimin], econazole
[Spectazole], ketoconazole [Nizoral], oxiconazole

skin areas such as the face and hands.
Ointment—A thick, spreadable substance that
contains medicine and is meant to be used on the
skin, or if a vaginal preparation, in the vagina.
Ophthalmic—Pertaining to the eye.
Otic—Pertaining to the ear.

has effects only in a specific area, not throughout
the body, particularly medicine that is put directly
on the skin.

allylamine derivatives (butenafine [Mentax], naftifine [Naftin], terbinafine [Lamisil]), the drugs in
this therapeutic class are chemically distinct from
each other. All drugs when applied topically have
a good margin of safety, and most show a high
degree of effectiveness. There are no studies comparing drugs on which to base a recommendation
for drugs of choice. Although some of the topical
antifungals are available over-the-counter, they
may be as effective as prescription drugs for this
purpose.
Traditional antifungal drugs such as undecylinic
acid (Cruex, Desenex) and gentian violet (also known
as crystal violet) remain available, but have a lower
cure rate (complete eradication of fungus) than the
newer agents and are not recommended. Tolnaftate
(Tinactin) has a lower cure rate than the newer drugs,
but may be used prophylactically to prevent
infection.

Recommended dosage
All drugs are applied topically. Consult individual
product information for specific application
recommendations.
As with all topical products, selection of the
dosage form may be as important as proper drug
selection. Consider factors such as presence or
absence of hair on the affected area, and type of
skin to which the medication is to be applied. Thin
liquids may preferable for application to hairy areas,
creams for the hands and face, and ointments may be
preferable for the trunk and legs. Other dosage forms
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

available include shampoos and sprays. Ciclopirox
and triacetin are available in formulations for topical
treatment of nail fungus as well as skin infections
(ciclopirox as Penlac Nail Lacquer and triacetin as
Ony-Clear Nail).
Most topical antifungal drugs require four weeks
of treatment. Infections in some areas, particularly
the spaces between toes, may take up to six weeks
for cure.

Precautions
Most topical antifungal agents are well tolerated.
The most common adverse effects are localized irritation caused by the vehicle or its components. This may
include redness, itch, and a burning sensation. Some
direct allergic reactions are possible.
Topical antifungal drugs should only be applied in
accordance with labeled uses. They are not intended or
ophthalmic (eye) or otic (ear) use. Application to
mucous membranes should be limited to appropriate
formulations.
The antifungal drugs have not been evaluated for
safety in pregnancy and lactation on topical application under the pregnancy risk category system.
Although systemic absorption is probably low, review
specific references. Gentian violet is labeled with a
warning against use in pregnancy.

Interactions
Topical antifungal drugs have no recognized
drug-drug or food-drug interactions.

Digestive tract—The stomach, intestines, and
other parts of the body through which food passes.
Diverticulosis—A condition in which the colon
(large intestine) develops a number of outpouchings or sacs.

Anyone who has had unusual reactions to

eat, drink, chew gum, or smoke cigarettes, which can
lead to uncomfortable amounts of gas in the digestive
system. Surgery and certain medical conditions, such
as irritable colon, peptic ulcer, and diverticulosis, can
also lead to gas build-up. Certain intestinal parasites
can contribute to the production of severe gas - these
parasites need to be treated separately with special
drugs. Abdominal pain, pressure, bloating, and flatulence are signs of too much gas. Antigas agents help
relieve the symptoms by preventing the formation of
gas pockets and breaking up gas that already is
trapped in the stomach and intestines.

Description
Antigas agents are sold as capsules, liquids, and
tablets (regular and chewable) and can be bought without a physician’s prescription. Some commonly used
brands are Gas-X, Flatulex, Mylanta Gas Relief,
Di-Gel, and Phazyme. The ingredient that helps relieve
excess gas is simethicone. Simethicone does not relieve
acid indigestion, but some products also contain antacids for that purpose. Check the label of the product or
ask the pharmacist for more information.

Recommended dosage
Check the product container for dosing information. Typically, the doses should be taken after meals
and at bedtime. Chewable forms should be chewed
thoroughly.
Check with a physician before giving this medicine to children under age 12 years.

Precautions
Some anti-gas medicines may contain sugar,
sodium, or other ingredients. Anyone who is on a

reflux
I Antigastroesophageal
drugs
Definition
These drugs are used to treat gastroesophageal
reflux, the backward flow of stomach contents into
the esophagus.

Purpose
The drug discussed here, cisapride (Propulsid), is
used to treat nighttime heartburn resulting from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In this condition, food and stomach juices flow backward from the
stomach into the esophagus, the part of the digestive
tract through which food passes on its way from the
mouth to the stomach. Normally, a muscular ring
called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) opens to
allow food into the stomach and then closes to prevent
the stomach’s contents from flowing back into the
esophagus. In people with GERD, this muscular ring
is either weak or it relaxes at the wrong times. The
main symptom is heartburn – a burning sensation
centered behind the breastbone and spreading upward
toward the neck and throat.
Cisapride works by strengthening the lower esophageal sphincter and making the stomach empty

Esophagus—The part of the digestive tract between
the pharynx and the stomach. (The pharynx is the
space just behind the mouth.)
Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat
that usually develop in response to injury or illness.

The effects of taking cisapride during pregnancy
have not been fully studied. Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant should check with
their physicians before taking Cisapride. The drug
passes into breast milk and may affect nursing
babies. Women who are breastfeeding and need to
take this medicine should check with their physicians. Avoiding breastfeeding while taking the drug
may be necessary.

Side effects
more quickly. This shortens the amount of time that the
esophagus comes in contact with the stomach contents.
Other drugs, such as H2-blockers are sometimes prescribed to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach.

Description
Cisapride is available only with a physician’s prescription. Cisapride is sold in tablet and liquid forms.

The most common side effects are abdominal
pain, bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation, nausea,
upper respiratory infections, inflammation of the
nasal passages and sinuses, headache, and viral
infections. Other side effects may occur. Anyone
who has unusual or troublesome symptoms after
taking this drug should get in touch with his or her
physician.

Recommended dosage
The dose depends on the patient. The average
dose for adults and children age 12 and over is 5-20 mg
taken two to four times a day. The medicine should be
taken 15 minutes before meals and at bedtime. For
children under 12, the dose is based on body weight
and should be determined by the child’s physician.

Precautions
This medicine is effective in treating only nighttime heartburn, not daytime heartburn.
Cisapride may increase the effects of alcohol and
tranquilizers.
Cisapride has caused dangerous irregular heartbeats in a few people who took it with other medicines.
Anyone who takes this drug should let the physician
know all other medicines he or she is taking. Patients
with heart problems should check with their physicians before taking cisapride.
Anyone who has bleeding, blockage, or leakage in
the stomach or intestines should not take cisapride.
Cisapride should not be used by anyone who has had
an unusual reaction to the drug in the past. In addition, people with any of the following medical problems should make sure their physicians are aware of
their conditions:


Epilepsy or history of seizures



Kidney disease



Liver disease.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Interactions
Cisapride may interact with a variety of other
medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or
both of the drugs may change or the risk of side effects
may be greater. Anyone who takes Cisapride should
let the physician know all other medicines he or she is
taking. Among the drugs that may interact with cisapride are:


Antifungal drugs such as ketoconazole (Nizoral),
miconazole (Monistat), and fluconazole (Diflucan)



Antibiotics such as clarithromycin (Biaxin) and erythromycin (E-Mycin, ERYC)

I Antihelminthic drugs
Definition
Antihelminthic drugs are used to treat parasitic
infestations.

Purpose
Parasitic infestations are caused by protozoa or
worms gaining entry into the body. Most of these
organisms cause infections by being ingested in the
form of eggs or larvae, usually present on contaminated
food or clothing, while others gain entry through skin
abrasions. Common parasitic infestations include amebiasis, malaria, giardiasis, hookworm, pinworm,
threadworm, whipworm and tapeworm infestations.
Once in the body, parasitic worms may go unnoticed
if they cause no severe symptoms. However, if they
multiply rapidly and spread to a major organ, they
can cause very serious and even life-threatening conditions. Antihelminthic drugs are prescribed to treat these
infestations. They function either by destroying the
worms on contact or by paralyzing them, or by altering
the permeability of their plasma membranes. The dead
worms then pass out of the body in the feces.

Description
Antihelminthic drugs are available only with a
prescription and are available as liquids, tablets or capsules. Some commonly used antihelminthics include:
albendazole (Albenza), mebendazole (Vermox), niclosamide (Niclocide), oxamniquine (Vansil), praziquantel
(Biltricide), pyrantel (Antiminth), pyantel pamoate
(Antiminth) and thiabendazole (Mintezol). Some types
of parasitic infestations are rarely seen in the United
States, thus, the corresponding antihelminthic drugs are
not widely distributed and need to be obtained from the
308

United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) when
required. These include for example bitional and ivermectin, used to treat onchocerciasis infestations. Other
antihelminthic drugs, such as diethylcarbamazepine
citrate (Hetrezan), used for treatment of roundworms
and other parasites, is supplied directly by its manufacturer when needed.
Most antihelminthic drugs are only active against
specific parasites, some are also toxic. Before treatment, the parasites must therefore be identified using
tests that look for parasites, eggs or larvae in feces,
urine, blood, sputum, or tissues. Thus, niclosamide is
used against tapeworms, but will not be effective for
the treatment of pinworm or roundworm infestations,
because it acts by inhibiting ATP production in tapeworm cells. Thiabendazole (Mintezole) is the drug
usually prescribed for treatment of threadworm, but
a similar drug, mebendazole (Vermox) works better on
whipworm by disrupting the microtubules of this
worm. Praziquantel is another drug that acts by altering the membrane permeability of the worms.

Preparation
Dosage is established depending on the patient’s
general health status and age, the type of antihelminthic drug used, and the type of parasitic infestation
being treated. The number of doses per day, the time
between doses, and the length of treatment will also
depend on these factors.
Antihelminthic drugs must be taken exactly as
directed to completely rid the body of the parasitic
infestation, and for as long as directed. A second
round of treatment may be required to ensure that
the infection has completely cleared.

Precautions
Some antihelminthic drugs work best when ingested
along with fatty foods, such as milk or ice cream. Oral
drugs should be taken with water during or after meals.
The prescribing physician should be informed if the
patient has a low-fat or other special diet.
Some antihelminthic drugs, such as praziquantel,
come in chewable form. These tablets should not be
chewed or kept in the mouth, but should swallowed
whole because their bitter taste may cause gagging or
vomiting.
Antihelminthic drugs sometimes need to be taken
with other medications. For example, steroids such as
prednisone are also prescribed together with the antihelminthic drug for tapeworm to reduce the inflammation that the worm may cause.

also performed with magnesium or sodium sulfate.

Hookworm or whipworm infections are also treated with iron supplements along with the antihelminthic prescription.

Regular medical visits are recommended for people affected by parasitic infestations. The physician
monitors whether the infection is clearing or not and
also keeps track of unwanted side effects. The prescribing physician should be informed if symptoms
do not disappear or if they get worse.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Some types of parasitic infestations (e.g. pinworms) can be passed from one person to another. It
is then often recommended that everyone in the household of an infected person be asked to also take the
prescribed antihelminthic drug.

Risks
People with the following medical conditions may
have adverse reactions to antihelminthic drugs. The
prescribing physician should accordingly be informed
if any of these conditions are present:


Allergies. Anyone who has had adverse reactions to
antihelminthic drugs should inform the prescribing
physician before taking the drugs again. The physician should also be informed about any other preexisting allergies.



Ulcers. Antihelminthic drugs are also contraindicated for persons diagnosed with ulcers of the digestive tract, especially ulcerative colitis.



Pregnancy. There is research evidence reporting that
some antihelminthic drugs cause birth defects or miscarriage in animal studies. No human birth defects
have been reported, but antihelminthic drugs are
usually not recommended for use during pregnancy.
Pregnant women should accordingly inform the prescribing physician.





Breastfeeding. Some antihelminthic drugs can pass
into breast milk. Breastfeeding may have to be discontinued until the antihelminthic treatment has
ended and breastfeeding mothers must also inform
the prescribing physician.
Other risk conditions. Any of the following medical
conditions should also be reported to the prescribing
physician: Crohn’s disease, liver disease, kidney disease and worm cysts in the eyes.

Common side effects of antihelminthic drugs
include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, sweating, dryness of the mouth and eyes, and ringing in the ears.
Anyone taking these drugs should accordingly avoid
driving, operating machines or other activities that
may be dangerous until they know how they are
affected by the drugs. Side effects usually wear off as
the body adjusts to the drug and do not usually require
medical treatment. Thiabendazole may cause the urine
to have an unusual odor that can last for a day after
the last dose. Other side effects of antihelminthic
drugs, such as loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal cramps are less common. If they
occur, they are usually mild and do not require medical attention.
More serious side effects, such as fever, chills,
confusion, extreme weakness, hallucinations, severe
diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, skin rashes, low back
pain, dark urine, blurred vision, seizures, and jaundice
have been reported in some cases. The patient’s physician should be informed immediately if any should
develop. As a rule, anyone who has unusual symptoms
310

after starting treatment with antihelminthic drugs
should notify the prescribing physician.
Antihelminthic drugs may interact with each
other or with other drugs, whether prescribed or not.
For example, it has been reported that use of the
antihelminthic drugs pyrantel and piperazine together
lowers the efficiency of pyrantel. Similarly, combining
a given antihelminthic drug with another medication
may increase the risk of side effects from either drug.

I Antihemorrhoid drugs
Definition
Antihemorrhoid drugs are medicines that reduce
the swelling and relieve the discomfort of hemorrhoids
(swellings in the area around the anus).

Purpose
Hemorrhoids are bulges in the veins that supply
blood to the skin and membranes of the area around
the anus. They may form for various reasons.
Frequent heavy lifting, sitting for long periods, or
straining to have bowel movements may put stress
on anal tissues, which can lead to hemorrhoids.
Some women develop hemorrhoids during pregnancy
as the expanding uterus puts pressure on the anal
tissues. The strain of labor and delivery can also
cause hemorrhoids or make existing hemorrhoids
worse. Hemorrhoids sometimes result from certain
medical problems, such as tumors pressing on the
lower bowel.
The main symptoms of hemorrhoids are bleeding
from the rectum, especially after a bowel movement,
and itching, burning, pain, and general discomfort in
the anal area. Over-the-counter antihemorrhoid products can relieve many of these symptoms. The products contain combinations of four main types of
ingredients:


Local anesthetics, such as benzocaine, lidocaine and
tetracaine, to temporarily relieve the pain



Vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine base, epinephrine hydrochloride, ephedrine sulfate and phenylephrine hydrochloride that reduce swelling and relieve
itching and discomfort by tightening blood vessels



Astringents (drying agents), such as witch hazel, calamine, and zinc oxide. These help shrink hemorrhoids

phenelzine (Nardil) or tranylcypromine (Parnate),
used to treat conditions including depression and
Parkinson’s disease. Anyone who is not sure if he or
she has taken this type of drug should check with a
physician or pharmacist before using an antihemorrhoid drug. People who are taking antidepressants or
medicine for high blood pressure also should not use
certain antihemorrhoid drugs. Check with a pharmacist for a list of drugs that may interact with specific
antihemorrhoid drugs.

by pulling water out of the swollen tissue. This, in
turn, helps relieve itching, burning, and irritation.


Protectants, such as cocoa butter, lanolin, glycerin,
mineral oil, and shark liver oil which soothe irritated
tissues and form a protective barrier to prevent
further irritation.

Description
Antihemorrhoid drugs are available as creams,
ointments and suppositories. Most can be bought
without a physician’s prescription.

Recommended dosage
Follow package instructions for using these products. Do not use more than the recommended
amount of this medicine every day. For explanations
or further information about how to use antihemorrhoid drugs, check with a physician or pharmacist.

Precautions
Do not use antihemorrhoid drugs for more than
seven days in a row. If the problem gets worse or does
not improve, check with a physician.
If rectal bleeding continues, check with a physician. This could be a sign of a condition that needs
medical attention.

Side effects
Side effects are rare, however, if a rash or any
other sign of an allergic reaction occurs, stop using
the medicine.

Interactions
Some antihemorrhoid drugs should not be used
by people who are taking or have recently taken monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors), such as
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

I Antihistamines
Definition
Antihistamines are drugs that block the action of
histamine (a compound released in allergic inflammatory reactions) at the H1 receptor sites, responsible for
immediate hypersensitivity reactions such as sneezing
and itching. Members of this class of drugs may also be
used for their side effects, including sedation and antiemesis (prevention of nausea and vomiting).

Purpose
Antihistamines provide their primary action by
blocking histamine H1 at the receptor site. They have
no effect on rate of histamine release, nor do they
inactivate histamine. By inhibiting the activity of
histamine, they can reduce capillary fragility, which
produces the erythema, or redness, associated with
allergic reactions. They will also reduce histamineinduced secretions, including excessive tears and
salivation. Additional effects vary with the individual drug used. Several of the older drugs, called
first-generation antihistamines, bind non-selectively
to H1 receptors in the central nervous system as
well as to peripheral receptors, and can produce
sedation, inhibition of nausea and vomiting, and
reduction of motion sickness. The second-generation
antihistamines bind only to peripheral H1 receptors,
and reduce allergic response with little or no
sedation.
The first-generation antihistamines may be
divided into several chemical classes. The side effect
profile, which also determines the uses of the drugs,
will vary by chemical class. The alkylamines include
brompheniramine (Dimetapp) and chlorpheniramine

D A N I E L E B O V E T (1907–1992)
A gifted researcher in therapeutic chemistry,
Daniele Bovet was born in Neuchatel, Switzerland, one
of four children of a professor of experimental education.
Bovet studied zoology and comparative anatomy at the
University of Geneva, receiving his doctor of science
degree in 1929. He then joined the Pasteur Institute in
Paris, becoming director of the Laboratory of Therapeutic
Chemistry in 1936.
Bovet investigated histamine, thought to cause
allergy symptoms. No antagonist of histamine was
known, so Bovet—with his research student Anne-Marie
Staub—began studying substances that blocked hormones
similar to histamine. By 1937 he had produced the first
antihistamine, thymoxydiethylamine. Since this substance
was too toxic for human use, Bovet and Staub performed
thousands more experiments seeking less toxic antihistamines. This work formed the basis for the development of
subsequent clinically useful antihistamines.

is a phenothiazine, chemically related to the major
tranquilizers, and while it is used for treatment of allergies, may also be used as a sedative, the relieve anxiety
prior to surgery, as an anti-nauseant, and for control of
motion sickness. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is chemically an ethanolamine, and in addition to its role in
reducing allergic reactions, may be used as a nighttime
sedative, for control of drug-induced Parkinsonism,
and, in liquid form, for control of coughs. Consult
more detailed references for further information.
The second generation antihistamines have no
central action, and are used only for treatment of
allergic reactions. These are divided into two chemical
classes. Cetirizine (Zyrtec) is a piperazine derivative,
and has a slight sedative effect. Loratidine (Claritin)
and fexofenadine (Allegra) are members of the piperadine class and are essentially non-sedating.

Recommended dosage
Dosage varies with drug, patient and intended
use. Consult more detailed references for further

When used for control of allergic reactions, antihistamines should be taken on a regular schedule,
rather than on an as-needed basis, since they have no
effect on histamine itself, nor on histamine already
bound to the receptor site.
Efficacy is highly variable from patient to patient. If
an antihistamine fails to provide adequate relief, switch
to a drug from a different chemical class. Individual
drugs may be effective in no more than 40% of patients,
and provide 50% relief of allergic symptoms.

Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of
High Blood Pressure report said that recent clinical trials
show that antihypertensive treatment can reduce incidence of stroke by 35-40%, heart attack by 20-25%,
and onset of new heart failure by 50%. Within this therapeutic class, there are several subgroups of drugs. There
are a large number of drugs used to control hypertension,
and the drugs listed below are representative, but not the
only members of their classes.
The calcium channel blocking agents, also called
slow channel blockers or calcium antagonists, inhibit
the movement of ionic calcium across the cell membrane.
This reduces the force of contraction of muscles of the
heart and arteries. Although the calcium channel blockers
are treated as a group, there are four different chemical
classes, leading to significant variations in the activity of
individual drugs. Nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia) has the
greatest effect on the blood vessels, while verapamil
(Calan, Isoptin) and diltiazem (Cardizem) have a greater
effect on the heart muscle itself.
Peripheral vasodilators such as hydralazine
(Apresoline), isoxuprine (Vasodilan), and minoxidil
(Loniten) act by relaxing blood vessels.
There are several groups of drugs that act by
reducing adrenergic nerve stimulation, the excitatory
nerve stimulation that causes contraction of the muscles in the arteries, veins, and heart. These drugs
include the beta-adrenergic blockers and alpha/beta
adrenergic blockers. There are also non-specific adrenergic blocking agents.
Beta-adrenergic blocking agents include propranolol (Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), and pindolol
(Visken). Propranolol acts on the beta-adrenergic
receptors anywhere in the body, and has been used as
a treatment for emotional anxiety and rapid heart

favorable side effect and safety profile.
In addition to these drugs, other classes of drugs
have been used to lower blood pressure, most
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

notably the thiazide diuretics. There are 12 thiazide
diuretics marketed in the United States, including
hydrochlorothiazide (Hydrodiuril, Esidrex), indapamide (Lozol), polythiazide (Renese), and hydroflumethiazide (Diucardin). The drugs in this class
appear to lower blood pressure through several
mechanisms. By promoting sodium loss they lower
blood volume. At the same time, the pressure of the
walls of blood vessels, the peripheral vascular resistance, is lowered. Thiazide diuretics are commonly
used as the first choice for reduction of mild hypertension, and may be used in combination with other
antihypertensive drugs.
Debate continued in 2003 as to the best drugs to
lower blood pressure. One study seemed to prove
that diuretics were the best initial choice, but a
study from Australia said that ACE inhibitors
were a superior choice. However, many physicians
agreed that the best treatment for a particular
patient depends on his or her particular age, economic situation, genetic factors and other existing
illnesses and conditions.
While designed to lower cholesterol rather than
blood pressure, a large clinical trial reported in 2003
that people with high blood pressure may one day
benefit from taking them. In the trial, participants
with increased risk for heart disease, even if it was not
from high cholesterol, benefited from taking statins.

Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage varies with patient, drug,
severity of hypertension, and whether the drug is being
used alone or in combination with other drugs.
Specialized references can be consulted for further
information.

Precautions
Because of the large number of classes and individual drugs in this group, specialized references offer
more complete information.
Peripheral vasodilators may cause dizziness and
orthostatic hypotension—a rapid lowering of blood
pressure when the patient stands up in the morning.
Patients taking these drugs must be instructed to rise
from bed slowly. Pregnancy risk factors for this group
are generally category C. Hydralazine has been shown to
cause cleft palate in animal studies, but there is no human
data available. Breastfeeding is not recommended.
ACE inhibitors generally are well tolerated, but
rarely may cause dangerous reactions including laryngospasm and angioedema. Persistent cough is a

common side effect. ACE inhibitors should not be
used in pregnancy. When used in pregnancy during
the second and third trimesters, angiotension-converting inhibitors (ACEIs) can cause injury to and even
death in the developing fetus. When pregnancy is
detected, discontinue the ACE inhibitor as soon as
possible. Breastfeeding is not recommended.
ACE II inhibitors are generally well tolerated and
do not cause cough. Pregnancy risk factor is category C
during the first trimester and category D during the
second and third trimesters. Drugs that act directly on
the renin-angiotensin system can cause fetal and
neonatal morbidity and death when administered to
pregnant women. Several dozen cases have been
reported in patients who were taking ACE inhibitors.
When pregnancy is detected, AIIRAs should be discontinued as soon as possible. Breastfeeding is not
recommended.
Thiazide diuretics commonly cause potassium
depletion. Patients should have potassium supplementation either through diet or potassium supplements.
Pregnancy risk factor is category B (chlorothiazide,
chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide, indapamide,
metolazone)
or

C
(bendroflumethiazide, benzthiazide, hydroflumethiazide, methyclothiazide, trichlormethiazide). Routine use during
normal pregnancy is inappropriate. Thiazides are
found in breast milk. Breastfeeding is not recommended.
Beta blockers may cause a large number of adverse
reactions including dangerous heart rate abnormalities.
Pregnancy risk factor is category B (acebutolol, pindolol, sotalol) or category C (atenolol, labetalol, esmolol,
metoprolol, nadolol, timolol, propranolol, penbutolol,
carteolol, bisoprolol). Breastfeeding is not recommended. In 2003, a report announced that adavances in
pharmacogenetics mean that in the future, physicians
may be able to use a patients genetic information to
make certain prescribing decisions for antihypertensives.

Interactions
Specific drug references should be consulted, since
interactions vary for antihypertensive drugs.

I Anti-hyperuricemic drugs
Definition
Anti-hyperuricemic drugs are used to treat hyperuricemia, the state of having too much uric acid in the
blood.

Purpose
Anti-hyperuricemic drugs decrease the levels
of uric acid in the blood, either by increasing
the rate at which uric acid is excreted in the
urine, or by preventing the formation of excess
uric acid.

Precautions
Before taking any medication, patients should
notify their physician of all other medications that
they are currently taking. Patients should also notify
their physician of any health problems they are currently experiencing. Patients must notify physicians if
they have kidney problems, since this might affect the
type of drug administered. Patients must also notify
their physician if they are allergic to any of the medications used to treat acute or long-term gout. Since all
of these factors contribute to the disease, patients
suffering from gout should attempt to lose weight,
avoid excess alcohol consumption, and avoid foods
high in purines, such as asparagus, sardines, lobster,
avocado, and peas.

Description
Gout and hyperuricemia
Persons with high levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia) may experience gout. Commonly gout occurs in
males in their 40s and 50s. Gout is defined by the
attacks of (arthritic) painful, reddened joints, and is
often accompanied by hard lumps in the painful joints.
The most common joint affected is the big toe. Kidney
stones, and/or poor kidney function may also be associated with hyperuricemia, but may not be considered
gout if the patient does not have painful joints. In
persons with gout (and associated symptoms), uric
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Acute gout attacks
When patients experience acute attacks of
gout, drugs that lower the levels of uric acid can
cause an acute gout attack or cause an attack to
become more severe. Thus, drugs that lower uric
acid levels and are used to treat gout in the long
term are not used in the short term. Medications
used in acute gout attacks include non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (such as indomethacin),
colchicine, and corticosteroids. Colchicine causes
side effects in a large number of individuals
(usually diarhhea). The most important factor in
the effective treatment of gout may not be the drug
used, but how quickly it is administered after an
acute attack has begun.
Long-term treatment
Long-term treatment of gout or hyperuricemia
usually involves one of four drugs: allopurinol,
probenicid, sulphinpyrazone, or benzbromarone
(as of 2001, benzbromarone was not available for
use in the United States). While allopurinol
decreases the amount of uric acid that is produced
(and may help prevent acute attacks of gout), the
other drugs all increase the rate at which uric acid
is excreted in the urine. As previously mentioned,
lowering the concentration of uric acid can cause
gout attacks. Thus, patients taking these medications should have the dose slowly increased (and
uric acid levels slowly lowered) to prevent acute
attacks of gout. Patients may also be treated with
colchicine or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs to prevent acute attacks of gout (corticosteroids are not used in this scenario because over the
long term corticosteroids have deleterious side
effects). In 2004, the FDA was seeking trial data
on a new drug called oxypurinol (Oxyprim) for
treating chronic gout. These medications may
have to be taken for life to prevent further gout
attacks.

I Anti-insomnia drugs
Definition
Anti-insomnia drugs are medicines that help
people fall asleep or stay asleep.

Purpose
Physicians prescribe anti-insomnia drugs for shortterm treatment of insomnia—a sleep problem in which
people have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep or
wake up too early and can’t go back to sleep. These drugs
should be used only for occasional treatment of temporary sleep problems and should not be taken for more than
a week or two at a time. People whose sleep problems last
longer than this should see a physician. Their sleep problems could be a sign of another medical problem.

Description
The anti-insomnia drug described here, zolpidem
(Ambien), is a classified as a central nervous system
(CNS) depressant. CNS depressants are medicines
that slow the nervous system. Physicians also prescribe
medicines in the benzodiazepine family, such as flurazepam (Dalmane), quazepam (Doral), triazolam
(Halcion), estazolam (ProSom), and temazepam
(Restoril), for insomnia. Benzodiazepine drugs are
described in the essay on antianxiety drugs. Zaleplon
(Sonata) is another anti-insomnia drug that is not
related to other drugs with the same effect. The barbiturates, such as pentobarbital (Nembutal) and secobarbital (Seconal) are no longer commonly used to treat
insomnia because they are too dangerous if they are
taken in overdoses. For patients with mild insomnia,
some antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine
(Benadryl) or hydroxyzine (Atarax) may be used,
since these also cause sleepiness.
Zolpidem is available only with a physician’s
prescription and comes in tablet form.

Anti-insomnia drugs

acid forms crystals, which then cause the aforementioned symptoms. Although uric acid levels must be
high in order for patients to have crystals form, and
therefore have gout, most persons with high uric acid
levels don’t ever have symptoms. Thus, recent criteria
for use of anti-hyperuricemic agents suggest that
patients who have never experienced symptoms of
gout should not receive drug therapy, unless their
hyperuricemia is associated with cancer (may lead to
kidney damage) or certain rare genetic disorders
(McGill, Rheumatologist, University of Sydney,
Australia, 2000).

Hallucinations usually result from drugs or mental
disorders.
Sleep apnea—A condition in which a person temporarily stops breathing during sleep.
Withdrawal symptoms—A group of physical or
mental symptoms that may occur when a person
suddenly stops using a drug to which he or she has
become dependent.

Recommended dosage
The recommended dose for adults is 5-10 mg just
before bedtime. The medicine works quickly, often
within 20 minutes, so it should be taken right before
going to bed.
For older people and others who may be more
sensitive to the drug’s effects, the recommended starting dosage is 5 mg just before bedtime.
Zolpidem may be taken with food or on an
empty stomach, but it may work faster when taken
on an empty stomach. Check with a physician or
pharmacists for instructions on how to take the
medicine.
318

Zolpidem is meant only for short-term treatment
of insomnia. If sleep problems last more than seven to
10 days, check with a physician. Longer-lasting sleep
problems could be a sign of another medical problem.
Also, this drug may lose its effectiveness when taken
every night for more than a few weeks.
Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, confused, lightheaded, or less alert the morning after they have taken
zolpidem. The medicine may also cause clumsiness,
unsteadiness, double vision, or other vision problems
the next day. For these reasons, anyone who takes
these drugs should not drive, use machines or do anything else that might be dangerous until they have
found out how zolpidem affects them.
This medicine has caused cause behavior changes
in some people, similar to those seen in people whose
behavior changes when they drink alcohol. Examples
include giddiness and rage. More extreme changes,
such as confusion, agitation, and hallucinations, also
are possible. Anyone who starts having strange or
unusual thoughts or behavior while taking this medicine should get in touch with his or her physician.
Zolpidem and other sleep medicines may cause a
special type of temporary memory loss, in which the
person does not remember what happens between the
time they take the medicine and the time its effects
wear off. This is usually not a problem, because people
go to sleep right after taking the medicine and stay
asleep until its effects wear off. But it could be a
problem for anyone who has to wake up before getting
a full night’s sleep (seven to eight hours). In particular,
travelers should not take this medicine on airplane
flights of less than seven to eight hours.
Because zolpidem works work on the central
nervous system, it may add to the effects of alcohol
and other drugs that slow down the central nervous
system, such as antihistamines, cold medicine,
allergy medicine, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants.
Zolpidem may also add to the effects of anesthetics,
including those used for dental procedures. The
combined effects of zolpidem and alcohol or other
CNS depressants (drugs that slow the central nervous system) can be very dangerous, leading to
unconsciousness or even death. People who take
zolpidem should not drink alcohol and should
check with their physicians before taking any other
CNS depressant. Anyone who shows signs of an
overdose or of the effects of combining zolpidem
drugs with alcohol or other drugs should have
immediate emergency help. Warning signs include
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Anyone who takes zolpidem for more than 1–2
weeks should not stop taking it without first checking
with a physician. Stopping the drug abruptly may
cause rebound insomnia; increased difficulty falling
asleep for the first one of two nights after the drug
has been discontinued. In rare cases, withdrawal
symptoms, such as vomiting, cramps, and unpleasant
feelings may occur. Gradual tapering may be
necessary.
Older people may be more sensitive to the effects
of zolpidem. This may increase the chance of side
effects, such as confusion, and may also increase the
risk of falling.
In people with breathing problems, zolpidem may
worsen the symptoms.
Special conditions
People with certain other medical conditions or
who are taking certain other medicines can have problems if they take zolpidem. Before taking this medicine, be sure to let the physician know about any of
these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to zolpidem in the past should let his or her
physician know before taking the drugs again. The
physician should also be told about any allergies to
foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY. Women who are pregnant or who

may become pregnant should check with their physicians about the safety of using zolpidem during
pregnancy.

USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking zolpidem with
certain other drugs may affect the way the drugs work
or may increase the chance of side effects.

Side effects
The most common minor side effects are daytime
drowsiness or a ‘‘drugged’’ feeling, vision problems,
memory problems, nightmares or unusual dreams,
vomiting, nausea, abdominal or stomach pain, diarrhea, dry mouth, headache, and general feeling of discomfort or illness. These problems usually go away as
the body adjusts to the drug and do not require medical treatment.

I Anti-itch drugs
Definition
Anti-itch drugs are medicines taken by mouth or
by injection to relieve itching.

Purpose
The medicine described here, hydroxyzine, is a
type of antihistamine used to relieve itching caused
by allergic reactions. An allergic reaction occurs
when the body is unusually sensitive to some substance, such as pollen, dust, mold, or certain foods or
medicine. The body reacts by releasing a chemical
called histamine that causes itching and other symptoms, such as sneezing and watery eyes. Antihistamines
reduce the symptoms by blocking the effects of
histamine.
Hydroxyzine is also prescribed for anxiety and to
help people relax before or after having general
anesthesia.

Description
Anti-itch drugs, also called antipruritic drugs, are
available only with a physician’s prescription and
come in tablet and injectable forms. Some commonly
used brands of the anti-itch drug hydroxyzine are
Atarax and Vistaril.

Recommended dosage
When prescribed for itching, the usual dosage for
adults is 25 mg, three to four times a day. For children
over six years of age, the usual dosage 50-100 mg per

day, divided into several small doses. The usual dosage
for children under six years of age is 50 mg per day,
divided into several small doses.
The dosage may be different for different people.
Check with the physician who prescribed the drug
or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the
correct dosage, and take the medicine exactly as
directed.

Precautions
This medicine should not be used for more than
four months at a time because its effects can wear off.
See a physician regularly while taking the medicine to
determine whether it is still needed.
Hydroxyzine may add to the effects of alcohol and
other drugs that slow down the central nervous system, such as other antihistamines, cold medicine,
allergy medicine, sleep aids, medicine for seizures,
tranquilizers, some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants. Anyone taking hydroxyzine should not drink
alcohol and should check with his or her physician
before taking any of the above.
Some people feel drowsy or less alert when using
this medicine. Anyone who takes it should not drive,
use machines, or do anything else that might be
dangerous until they have found out how the drugs
affect them.
Anyone who has had unusual reactions to hydroxyzine in the past should let his or her physician know
before taking the medicine again. The physician
should also be told about any allergies to foods,
dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
A woman who is pregnant or who may become
pregnant should check with her physician before taking this medicine. In studies of laboratory animals,
hydroxyzine has caused birth defects when taken during pregnancy. Although the drug’s effects on pregnant women have not been fully studied, physicians
advise against taking it in early pregnancy.

The most common side effect, drowsiness, usually
goes away as the body adjusts to the drug. If it does
not, reducing the dosage may be necessary. Other side
effects, such as dry mouth, also may occur and do not
need medical attention unless they continue.

Organism—An individual of some type of life form,
such as a plant or an animal.
Parasite—An organism that lives and feeds in or on

I Antimalarial drugs
Definition
Antimalarial drugs are medicines that prevent or
treat malaria.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Antimalarial drugs treat or prevent malaria, a
disease that occurs in tropical, subtropical, and
some temperate regions of the world. The disease
is caused by a parasite, Plasmodium, which belongs
to a group of one-celled organisms known as protozoa. The only way to get malaria is to be bitten by a
certain type of mosquito that has bitten someone
who has the disease. Thanks to mosquito control
programs, malaria has been eliminated in the
United States, almost all of Europe, and large
parts of Central and South America. However, mosquito control has not worked well in other parts
of the world, and malaria continues to be a
major health problem in parts of Africa, Southeast
Asia, Latin America, Haiti, the Dominican Republic,
and some Pacific Islands. Every year, some
30,000 Americans and Europeans who travel to
these areas get malaria. People planning to travel to
the tropics are often advised to take antimalarial
drugs before, during, and after their trips, to help
them avoid getting the disease and bringing it home
with them. These drugs kill Plasmodium or prevent
its growth.
In recent years, some strains of Plasmodium
have become resistant to antimalarial drugs, and
medical researchers have stepped up efforts to
develop a malaria vaccine. In early 1997, researchers reported encouraging results from a small study
of one vaccine and planned to test the vaccine
in Africa.
321

Antimalarial drugs

BREASTFEEDING. Women who are breastfeeding
should also check with their physicians before using
hydroxyzine. The medicine may pass into breast milk
and may cause problems in nursing babies whose
mothers take it.

Antimalarial drugs

Description
Antimalarial drugs are available only with a physician’s prescription. They come in tablet, capsule, and
injectable forms. Among the commonly used antimalarial drugs are chloroquine (Aralen), mefloquine
(Lariam), primaquine, pyrimethamine (Daraprim),
and quinine. Other drugs are constantly in development. In early 2004, scientists were researching promising new agents called beat-amino hydroxamates
and amino acid-conjugated quinolinamines.

Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage depends on the type of
antimalarial drug, its strength, and the form in which
it is being used (such as tablet or injection). The dosage
may also be different for different people. The physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who
filled the prescription can recommend the correct
dosage. This medicine should be taken exactly as
directed and for the full time of treatment. If the
drug is being taken to treat malaria, it should not be
stopped just because symptoms begin to improve.
Symptoms may return if the drug is stopped too
soon. Larger or more frequent doses than the physician has ordered should never be taken, nor should the
drug be taken for longer than directed.
Travelers taking this medicine to prevent malaria
may be told to take it for one to two weeks before their
trip and for four weeks afterward, as well as for the
whole time they are away. It is important to follow
these directions.
Antimalarial drugs work best when they are taken
on a regular schedule. When taken once a week to
prevent malaria, they should be taken on the same day
every week. When taken daily or several times a day to
treat malaria, they should be taken at the same time
every day. Doses should not be missed or skipped.
Some antimalarial drugs should be taken with
meals or with milk to prevent upset stomach. Others
must be taken with a full glass of water. It is important
to follow directions along with the prescription.

Precautions
Antimalarial drugs may cause lightheadedness,
dizziness, blurred vision and other vision changes.
Anyone who takes these drugs should not drive, use
machines or do anything else that might be dangerous
until they have found out how the drugs affect them.
The antimalarial drug mefloquine (Lariam) has
received attention because of reports that it causes
panic attacks, hallucinations, anxiety, depression,
322

paranoia, and other mental and mood changes, sometimes lasting for months after the last dose. In fact, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began
requiring warnings with Lariam beginning in July
2003 because of serious psychiatric effects caused by
the drug. Pharmacists are required to include a 2,000word medication guide detailing the warnings.
Anyone who has unexplained anxiety, depression,
restlessness, confusion, or other troubling mental or
mood changes after taking mefloquine should call a
physician right away. Switching to a different antimalarial drug may be an alternative and can allow the side
effects to stop.
Anyone taking antimalarial drugs to prevent
malaria who develops a fever or flu-like symptoms
while taking the medicine or within 2-3 months after
traveling to an area where malaria is common should
call a physician immediately.
If the medicine is being taken to treat malaria, and
symptoms stay the same or get worse, The patient
should check with the physician who prescribed the
medicine.
Patients who take this medicine over a long period
of time need to have a physician check them periodically for unwanted side effects.
Babies and children are especially sensitive to the
antimalarial drug chloroquine. Not only are they more
likely to have side effects from the medicine, but they
are also at greater risk of being harmed by an overdose. A single 300-mg tablet could kill a small child.
This medicine should be kept out of the reach of children
and safety vials should be used.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if
they take antimalarial drugs. Before taking these
drugs, the physician should know about any of these
conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to antimalarial drugs or related medicines in
the past should let his or her physician know before
taking the drugs again. The physician should also be
told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives,
or other substances.
PREGNANCY. In laboratory animal studies, some
antimalarial drugs cause birth defects. But it is also
risky for a pregnant woman to get malaria. Untreated
malaria can cause premature birth, stillbirth, and
miscarriage. When given in low doses to prevent
malaria, antimalarial drugs have not been reported

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

BREASTFEEDING. Some antimalarial drugs pass
into breast milk. Although no problems have been
reported in nursing babies whose mothers took antimalarial drugs, babies and young children are particularly sensitive to some of these drugs. Women who are
breastfeeding should check with their physicians
before using antimalarial drugs.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using antimalarial drugs, people who have any of these medical problems (or have had them in the past) should
make sure their physicians are aware of their
conditions:

Side effects
High doses of the antimalarial drug pyrimethamine may cause blood problems that can interfere with
healing and increase the risk of infection. People taking this drug should be careful not to injure their gums
when brushing or flossing their teeth or using toothpicks. If possible, dental work should be postponed
until treatment is complete and the blood has returned
to normal.
The most common side effects of antimalarial
drugs are diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, stomach
cramps or pain, loss of appetite, headache, itching,
difficulty concentrating, dizziness, lightheadedness,
and sleep problems. These problems usually go away
as the body adjusts to the drug and do not require
medical treatment. Less common side effects, such as
hair loss or loss of color in the hair; skin rash; or blueblack discoloration of the skin, fingernails, or inside of
the mouth also may occur and do not need medical
attention unless they are long-lasting.

I Antimigraine drugs
Definition
Antimigraine drugs are medicines used to prevent
or reduce the severity of migraine headaches.

Purpose
Migraine headaches usually cause a throbbing
pain on one side of the head. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, increased sensitivity to light and sound, and
other symptoms may accompany the pain. The attacks
may last for several hours or for a day or more and
may come as often as several times a week. Some
people who get migraine headaches have warning signals before the headaches begin, such as restlessness,
tingling in an arm or leg, or seeing patterns of flashing
lights. This set of signals is called an aura. The antimigraine drugs discussed in this section are meant to
be taken as soon as the pain begins, to relieve the pain
and other symptoms. Other types of drugs, such as
antiseizure medicines, antidepressants, calcium channel blockers and beta blockers, are sometimes prescribed to prevent attacks in people with very severe
or frequent migraines.

Description
Migraine is thought to be caused by electrical and
chemical imbalances in certain parts of the brain.
These imbalances affect the blood vessels in the
brain – first tightening them up, then widening them.
As the blood vessels widen, they stimulate the release
of chemicals that increase sensitivity to pain and cause
inflammation and swelling. Antimigraine drugs are
believed to work by correcting the imbalances and by
tightening the blood vessels.
Examples of drugs in this group are ergotamine
(Cafergot), naratriptan (Amerge), sumatriptan
(Imitrex), rizatriptan (Maxalt), almotriptan (Axert),
and zolmitriptan (Zomig). Methysergide maleate
(Sansert) may be used by patients whose headaches
are not controlled by other drugs, while some patients
do well on other drugs. For example, combinations
or ergotamine and caffeine may be very effective.
The caffeine acts by constricting blood vessels to
relieve the headache. Sometimes, an analgesic such
as acetaminophen, caffeine, and a barbiturate which
acts as a sedative, are combined, as in Fioricet and
similar compounds. These medicines are available
only with a physician’s prescription and come in
several forms. Ergotamine is available as tablets
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Brand Name
(Generic Name)
Cafergot

Take at the first sign of a migraine attack. Patients
who get warning signals (aura) may take the drug as
soon as they know a headache is coming.
Possible Common Side Effects Include:
Nausea, increased blood pressure, fluid
retention, numbness, increased heart rate,
tingling sensation
Burning, flushing, neck pain, inflammation at
injection site, sore throat, tingling sensation
Constipation or diarrhea, headache, nausea, rash

TABLETS. No more than 6 tablets for any single

attack.
No more than 10 tablets per week.
SUPPOSITORIES. No more than 2 suppositories for

any single attack.
Dizziness, rash

No more than 5 suppositories per week.
Naratriptan

KEY TERMS
Anticonvulsant—A type of drug given to prevent
seizures. Some patients with migraines can be
treated effectively with an anticonvulsant.
Aura—A set of warning symptoms, such as seeing
flashing lights, that some people have 10–30
minutes before a migraine attack.
Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat
that usually develop in response to injury or illness.
Status migrainosus—The medical term for an acute
migraine headache that lasts 72 hours or longer.

Take as soon as pain or other migraine symptoms
begin. Also effective if taken any time during an
attack. Do not take the drug until the pain actually
starts as not all auras result in a migraine.
TABLETS. Usual dose is one 1-mg tablet taken with
water or other liquid.

Doses of 2.5-mg may be used, but they may cause
more side effects.
If the headache returns or if there is only partial
response, the dose may be repeated once after 4 hours,
for a maximum dose of 5 mg in a 24-hour period.
Larger doses do not seem to offer any benefit.
Sumatriptan

and rectal suppositories; sumatriptan as tablets,
injections, and nasal spray; and zolmitriptan as
tablets.

Take as soon as pain or other migraine symptoms
begin. Also effective if taken any time during an
attack. Do not take the drug until the pain actually
starts as not all auras result in a migraine.

Antimigraine drugs are used to treat headaches
once they have started. These drugs should not be
taken to prevent headaches.

TABLETS. Usual dose is one 25-mg tablet, taken
with water or other liquid.

Some patients are given anti-epileptic drugs,
which are also known as anticonvulsants, to treat
migraine headaches. As of 2003, sodium valproate
(Epilim) is the only anticonvulsant approved by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prevention of migraine. Such newer anticonvulsants as
gabapentin (Neurontin) and topiramate (Topamax)
are being evaluated as migraine preventives as of
early 2004.

Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage depends on the type of
drug. Typical recommended dosages for adults are
given below for each type of drug.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Doses should be spaced at least 2 hours apart.
Anyone with liver disease should consult with a
physician for proper dosing.
INJECTIONS. No more than 6 mg per dose, injected

under the skin.
No more than two 6-mg injections per day. These
doses should be taken at least 1 hour apart.
Zolmitriptan
Take as soon as symptoms begin.
TABLETS. Usual dose is 1–5 mg. Additional doses
may be taken at 2-hour intervals.

No more than 10 mg per 24 hour period.

Antimigraine drugs

General dosage advice
Always take antimigraine drugs exactly as directed. Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do
not take the drug for longer than directed.
If possible, lie down and relax in a dark, quiet
room for a few hours after taking the medicine.

Precautions
These drugs should be used only to treat the type
of headache for which they were prescribed. Patients
should not use them for other headaches, such as those
caused by stress or too much alcohol, unless directed
to do so by a physician.
Anyone whose headache is unlike any previous
headache should check with a physician before taking
these drugs. If the headache is far worse than any
other, emergency medical treatment should be sought
immediately.
Taking too much of the antimigraine drug ergotamine (Cafergot), can lead to ergot poisoning. Symptoms
include headache, muscle pain, numbness, coldness, and
unusually pale fingers and toes. If not treated, the condition can lead to gangrene (tissue death).
Sumatriptan (Imitrex), naratriptan (Amerge),
rizatriptan (Maxalt) and zolmitriptan (Zomig) may
interact with ergotamine. These drugs should not be
taken within 24 hours of taking any drug containing
ergotamine.
Some antimigraine drugs work by tightening
blood vessels in the brain. Because these drugs also
affect blood vessels in other parts of the body, people
with coronary heart disease, circulatory problems, or
high blood pressure should not take these medicines
unless directed to do so by their physicians.
About 40% of all migraine attacks do not
respond to treatment with triptans or any other
medication. If the headache lasts longer than 72
hours—a condition known as status migrainosus—
the patient may be given narcotic medications to
bring on sleep and stop the attack. Patients with
status migrainosus are often hospitalized because
they are likely to be dehydrated from severe nausea
and vomiting.
Special conditions
People with certain other medical conditions or
who are taking certain other medicines can have problems if they take antimigraine drugs. Before taking
these drugs, be sure to let the physician know about
any of these conditions:
326

ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to ergotamine, caffeine, sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, or other antimigraine drugs in the past should let
his or her physician know before taking the drugs
again. The physician should also be told about any
allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other
substances.
PREGNANCY. Women who are pregnant should
not take ergotamine (Cafergot). The effects of other
antimigraine drugs during pregnancy have not been
well studied. Any woman who is pregnant or plans to
become pregnant should let her physician know before
an antimigraine drug is prescribed.
BREASTFEEDING. Some antimigraine drugs can
pass into breast milk and may cause serious problems
in nursing babies. Women who are breastfeeding
should check with their physicians about whether to
stop breastfeeding while taking the medicine.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using antimigraine drugs, people with any of these medical problems should make sure their physicians know about
their conditions:


Coronary heart disease



Angina (crushing chest pain)



Circulatory problems or blood vessel disease



High blood pressure



Liver problems



Kidney problems



Any infection



Eye problems.

USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking antimigraine
drugs certain other drugs may affect the way the drugs
work or may increase the chance of side effects.

Side effects
The most common side effects are fluid retention, flushing; high blood pressure; unusually fast
or slow heart rate; numbness; tingling; itching;
nausea; vomiting; weakness; neck or jaw pain and
stiffness; feelings of tightness, heaviness, warmth,
or coldness; sore throat; and discomfort of the
mouth and tongue.
More serious side effects are not common, but
they may occur. If any of the following side effects
occur, call a physician immediately:


Tightness in the chest



Bluish tinge to the skin



Cold arms and legs
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Signs of gangrene, such as coldness, dryness, and a
shriveled or black appearance of a body part



Monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as phenelzine
(Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate)



Dizziness





Drowsiness

Certain antidepressants, such as sertraline (Zoloft),
fluoxetine (Prozac), and paroxetine (Paxil)

Shortness of breath or wheezing





Fluvoxamine (Luvox), prescribed for obsessive compulsive disorder or chronic pain.



Skin rash



Swelling of the eyelids or face.

Anticonvulsants should not be taken together
with aspirin, alcohol, or tranquilizers.

Possible side effects with anticonvulsants include
dizziness, drowsiness, emotional upset, skin rash, temporary hair loss, nausea, and irregular menstrual
periods.

Remember naratriptan, sumatriptan, rizatriptan
and zolmitriptan may interact with ergotamine. These
drugs should not be taken within 24 hours of taking
any drug containing ergotamine.

Other side effects may occur with any antimigraine drug. Anyone who has unusual symptoms
after taking this medicine should get in touch with
his or her physician.

Resources

Alternative treatments
There are two herbal remedies that are reported to
be effective as alternative treatments for migraine. One
is feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium), an herb related to
the daisy that is traditionally used in England to prevent migraines. Published studies indicate that feverfew can reduce the frequency and intensity of
migraines. It does not, however, relieve pain once the
headache has begun. The other herbal remedy is butterbur root (Petasites hybridus). Petadolex is a natural
preparation made from butterbur root that has been
sold in Germany since the 1970s as a migraine preventive. Petadolex has been available in the United States
since December 1998.

Interactions
Antimigraine drugs may interact with other medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of
the drugs may change, or the risk of side effects may be
greater. Anyone who takes these drugs should let the
physician know all other medicines he or she is taking.
Among the drugs that may interact with antimigraine
drugs are:


Beta blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin) and propranolol (Inderal)



Drugs that tighten blood vessels such as epinephrine
(EpiPen) and pseudoephedrine (Sudafed)



Nicotine such as cigarettes or Nicoderm, Habitrol,
and other smoking-cessation drugs



Certain antibiotics, such as erythromycin and clarithromycin (Biaxin)

I Antimyocardial antibody test
Definition
Testing for antimyocardial antibodies is done
when evaluating a person for heart damage or heart
disease.

Purpose
Antimyocardial antibodies are autoantibodies.
Normal antibodies are special proteins built by the
body as a defense against foreign material entering the
body. Autoantibodies are also proteins built by the body,
but instead of attacking foreign material, they inappropriately attack the body’s own cells. Antimyocardial antibodies attack a person’s heart muscle, or myocardium.
This test may be done on a person who recently
had trauma to the heart, such as heart surgery or a
myocardial infarction (heart attack). It also may be
done on someone with heart disease, such as cardiomyopathy or rheumatic fever.
Although the presence of antimyocardial antibodies does not diagnose heart damage or disease, there is
a connection between the presence of these antibodies
and damage to the heart. The amount of damage, however, cannot be predicted by the amount of antibodies.
These antibodies usually appear after heart surgery
or the beginning of disease, but they may be present before
surgery or the onset of disease. In 30% of people with
myocardial infarction and 70% of people having heart
surgery, antimyocardial antibodies will appear within
two to three weeks and stay for three to eight weeks.

Description
A 5-10 mL sample of venous blood is drawn from
the patient’s arm in the region of the inner elbow.
Antimyocardial antibodies are detected by combining
a patient’s serum (clear, thin, sticky fluid in blood)
with cells from animal heart tissue, usually that of a
monkey. Antimyocardial antibodies in the serum bind
to the heart tissue cells. A fluorescent dye is then added
328

KEY TERMS
Antibody—A special protein built by the body as
a defense against foreign material entering the
body.
Antimyocardial antibody—An autoantibody that
attacks a person’s own heart muscle, or
myocardium.
Autoantibody— An antibody that attacks the
body’s own cells or tissues.
Myocardial infarction—A block in the blood supply to the heart, resulting in what is commonly
called a heart attack.
Myocardium—The muscular middle layer of the
heart.
Titer—A dilution of a substance with an exact
known amount of fluid. For example, one part of
serum diluted with four parts of saline is a titer
of 1:4.

to the mixture. This dye will attach to any antibodies
and heart tissue cells bound together. The final mixture is studied under a microscope that is designed to
show fluorescence. If fluorescent cells are seen under
the microscope, the test is positive.
When the test is positive, the next step is to find
out how much antibody is present. The patient’s
serum is diluted, or titered, and the test is done
again. The serum is then further diluted and the test
repeated until the serum is so dilute that fluorescence is
no longer seen. The last dilution that showed fluorescence is the titer reported.

Preparation
No fasting or special prepartion is needed. Before
the test is done it should be explained to the patient.

Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site after the blood is drawn or the person may feel
dizzy or faint. Pressure to the puncture site until the
bleeding stops reduces bruising. Warm packs on the
puncture site relieve discomfort.

Normal results
Antimyocardial antibodies are not normally seen
in healthy individuals.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Antinausea Drugs

A positive result means that antimyocardial antibodies are present and that heart disease or damage is likely.
Further testing may be needed as other autoantibodies
could also be present, causing a false abnormal test.

I Antinausea drugs

Central nervous system—The brain and spinal cord.
Spasm—Sudden, involuntary tensing of a muscle or
a group of muscles.

Purpose
Antinausea drugs such as prochlorperazine
(Compazine), usually control both nausea and vomiting. Prochlorperazine is also sometimes prescribed for
symptoms of mental disorders, such as schizophrenia.

Prochlorperazine is available only with a physician’s prescription. It is sold in syrup, capsule, tablet,
injection, and suppository forms.

Recommended dosage
To control nausea and vomiting in adults, the
usual dose is:


Tablets—one 5-mg or 10-mg tablet three to four
times a day



Extended-release capsules—one 15-mg capsule first
thing in the morning or one 10-mg capsule every
12 hours



Suppository—25 mg, twice a day

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Constipation, headache, fatigue, abdominal
pain

Anesthetic—Medicine that causes a loss of feeling,
especially pain. Some anesthetics also cause a loss
of consciousness.
Antihistamine—Medicine that prevents or relieves
allergy symptoms.

Antinausea drugs are medicines that control nausea—a feeling of sickness or queasiness in the stomach
with an urge to vomit. These drugs also prevent or stop
vomiting. Drugs that control vomiting are called antiemetic drugs.

Description

Blurred vision, diarrhea, cramps, headache

KEY TERMS

Definition

Another commonly prescribed antinausea drug is
promethazine (Phenergan). Promethazine also may be
prescribed to relieve allergy symptoms and apprehension, as well as motion sickness.

Possible Common Side Effects Include:
Involuntary muscle spasms, dizziness,
jitteriness, puckering of the mouth
Dizziness, dry mouth, nausea and vomiting,
rash
Fatigue, drowsiness, restlessness

Tranquilizer—Medicine that has a calming effect
and is used to treat anxiety and mental tension.



Syrup—5-10 mg three to four times a day



Injection—5-10 mg injected into a muscle three to
four times a day.

Doses for children must be determined by a
physician.
Promethazine may be administered in pill, syrup,
chewable tablet, or extended release capsule form by
prescription only. For severe nausea, it may be administered by injection or via a suppository. The physician
recommends dose depending on the patient’s condition.

Precautions
Prochlorperazine may cause a movement disorder
called tardive dyskinesia. Signs of this disorder are
involuntary twitches and muscle spasms in the face
and body and jutting or rolling movements of the
tongue. The condition may be permanent. Older people,
especially women, are particularly at risk of developing
this problem when they take prochlorperazine.
329

Antinausea drugs

Abnormal results

Antinausea drugs

Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, or less
alert when using this medicine. The drug may also cause
blurred vision, and movement problems. For these reasons, anyone who takes this drug should not drive, use
machines or do anything else that might be dangerous
until they have found out how the drug affects them.
Prochlorperazine makes some people sweat less,
which can allow the body to overheat. The drug may
also make the skin and eyes more sensitive to the sun.
People who are taking prochlorperazine should try to
avoid extreme heat and exposure to the sun. When
going outdoors, they should wear protective clothing,
a hat, a sunscreen with a skin protection factor (SPF)
of at least 15, and sunglasses that block ultraviolet
(UV) light. Saunas, sunlamps, tanning booths, tanning beds, hot baths, and hot tubs should be avoided
while taking this medicine. Anyone who must be
exposed to extreme heat while taking the drug should
check with his or her physician.
This medicine adds to the effects of alcohol and
other drugs that slow down the central nervous system, such as antihistamines, cold and flu medicines,
tranquilizers, sleep aids, anesthetics, some pain medicines, and muscle relaxants. Drinking alcohol while
taking prochlorperazine is not advised and patients
should check with the physician who prescribed the
drug before combining it with any other medicines.
Do not stop taking this medicine without checking
with the physician who prescribed it. Stopping the drug
suddenly can cause dizziness, nausea, vomiting, tremors,
and other side effects. When stopping the medicine, it
may be necessary to taper down the dose gradually.
Prochlorperazine may cause false pregnancy tests.
Women who are pregnant (or planning to become
pregnant) or breast feeding should check with their
physicians before using antinausea medicines.
Before using prochlorperazine, people with any of
the medical problems should make sure their physicians are aware of their conditions:


Previous sensitivity

or

allergic

reaction



Heart disease



Glaucoma



Brain tumor



Intestinal blockage



Abnormal blood conditions, such as leukemia



Some people may experience side effects from
promethazine including:
330



dry mouth



drowsiness



confusion



A physician should be contacted immediately if a
patient experiences the following effects while taking
promethazine:


vision problems



ringing in the ears



tremors



insomnia



excitement



restlessness



yellowing of the skin or eyes



Side effects
Many side effects are possible with prochlorperazine, including, but not limited to, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, decreased sweating, dry mouth, stuffy
nose, movement problems, changes in menstrual period,
increased sensitivity to sun, and swelling or pain in
breasts. Anyone who has unusual or troublesome symptoms after taking prochlorperazine should get in touch
with his or her physician.
Side effects associated with promethazine include
those listed above and interactions with various medications that may cause complications or lessen the
effects of the drug. A physician should be notified of
other medications the patient is on when taking
promethazine.

Interactions
Prochlorperazine may interact with other medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or both of
the drugs may change or the risk of side effects may be
greater. Among the drugs that may interact with prochlorperazine are antiseizure drugs such as phenytoin
(Dilantin) and carbamazepine (Tegretol), anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin), and drugs that
slow the central nervous system such as alprazolam
(Xanax), diazepam (Valium), and secobarbital
(Seconal). Not every drug that interacts with prochlorperazine is listed here. A physician or pharmacist can
advise patients about prescription or nonprescription

In autoimmune diseases, the body makes antibodies that work against its own cells or tissues.
Rheumatic diseases (diseases that affect connective
tissue, including the joints, bone, and muscle) are
also associated with these antibodies. Autoantibodies
are proteins built by the body, but instead of guarding
against foreign material (including bacteria, viruses,
and fungi) as normal antibodies do, they attack the
body’s own cells.
Autoimmune and rheumatic diseases can be difficult to diagnose. People with the same disease can
have very different symptoms. A helpful strategy in
the diagnosis of these diseases is to find and identify an
autoantibody in the person’s blood.
The antinuclear antibody test looks for a
group of autoantibodies that attack substances
found in the center (nucleus) of all cells. It is useful
as a screen for many autoantibodies associated
with diseases that affect the entire body (systemic
diseases).
This test is particularly useful when diagnosing a
person with symptoms of SLE, an illness that affects
many body organs and tissues. If the test is negative, it
is unlikely that the person has SLE; if the test is positive,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

more tests are done to confirm whether the person has
SLE or another related disease. Other diseases, such as
scleroderma, Sjögren’s syndrome, Raynaud’s disease,
rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune hepatitis, often
have a positive test for antinuclear antibodies.

Description
Five to 10 mL of blood is needed for this test. The
antinuclear antibody test is done by adding a person’s
serum to commercial cells mounted on a microscope
slide. If antinuclear antibodies are in the serum, they
bind to the nuclei of cells on the slide. Next, a second
antibody is added to the mixture. This antibody is
‘‘tagged’’ with a fluorescent dye so that it can be
seen. The second antibody attaches to any antibodies
and cells bound together and, because of the fluorescent ‘‘tag,’’ the areas with antinuclear antibodies seem
to glow, or fluoresce, when the slide is viewed under an
ultraviolet microscope.
If fluorescent cells are seen, the test is positive.
When positive, the serum is diluted, or titered, and
the test done again. These steps are repeated until the
serum is so dilute it no longer gives a positive result.
The last dilution that shows fluorescence is the titer
reported.
The pattern of fluorescence within the cells gives
the physician clues as to what the disease might be.
The test result includes the titer and the pattern.
This test is also called the fluorescent antinuclear
antibody test or FANA. Results are available within
one to three days.

Preparation
No special preparations or diet changes are
required before a person undergoes an antinuclear

Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to

Normal results will be negative, showing no antinuclear antibodies.

Abnormal results
A positive test in a person with symptoms of an
autoimmune or rheumatic disease helps the physician
make a diagnosis. More than 95% of people with SLE
have a positive ANA test. Scleroderma has a 60-71%
positive rate; Sjögren’s disease, 50-60%, and rheumatoid arthritis, 25-30%.
Several factors must be considered when interpreting a positive test. Diseases other than autoimmune diseases can cause autoantibodies. Some
healthy people have a positive test. More testing
is done after a positive test to identify individual
autoantibodies associated with the various diseases.

arms, legs, jaw, and face; stiffness or rigidity of the
arms, legs, and trunk; slowness of movement (bradykinesia); and poor balance and coordination. Parkinson’s
disease is the most common form of parkinsonism and
is seen more frequently with advancing age. Other
forms of the disorder may result from viral infections,
environmental toxins, carbon monoxide poisoning, and
the effects of treatment with antipsychotic drugs.
The immediate cause of Parkinson’s disease or
Parkinsonian-like syndrome is the lack of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. Drug therapy may
take several forms, including replacement of dopamine, inhibition of dopamine metabolism to increase
the effects of the dopamine already present, or sensitization of dopamine receptors. Drugs may be used
singly or in combination.

I Antiparkinson drugs
Definition
Antiparkinson drugs are medicines that relieve the
symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and other forms of
parkinsonism.

Purpose
Antiparkinson drugs are used to treat symptoms of
parkinsonism, a group of disorders that share four
main symptoms: tremor or trembling in the hands,
332

Description
Levodopa (Larodopa) is the mainstay of
Parkinson’s treatment. The drug crosses the bloodbrain barrier, and is converted to dopamine. The drug
may be administered alone, or in combination with
carbidopa (Lodosyn) which inhibits the enzyme responsible for the destruction of levodopa. The limitation of
levodopa or levodopa-carbidopa therapy is that after
approximately two years of treatment, the drugs cease
to work reliably. This has been termed the ‘‘on-off phenomenon.’’ Additional treatment strategies have been
developed to retard the progression of Parkinsonism,
or to find alternative approaches to treatment.
Anticholinergic drugs reduce some of the symptoms of Parkinsonism, and reduce the reuptake of
dopamine, thereby sustaining the activity of the natural neurohormone. They may be effective in all stages
of the disease. All drugs with anticholinergic

Anticholigerginc—An agent that blocks the parasympathetic nerves and their actions.
Bradykinesia—Extremely slow movement.
Bruxism—Compulsive grinding or clenching of the
teeth, especially at night.
Carbon monoxide—A colorless, odorless, highly
poisonous gas.
Central nervous system—The brain and spinal cord.
Chronic—A word used to describe a long-lasting
condition. Chronic conditions often develop gradually and involve slow changes.
Hallucination—A false or distorted perception
of objects, sounds, or events that seems real.
Hallucinations usually result from drugs or mental
disorders.
Heat stroke—A severe condition caused by prolonged exposure to high heat. Heat stroke interferes
with the body’s temperature regulating abilities and
can lead to collapse and coma.
Parkinsonism—A group of conditions that all have
these typical symptoms in common: tremor, rigidity, slow movement, and poor balance and
coordination.
Pregnancy category— A system of classifying drugs
according to their established risks for use during
pregnancy. Category A: Controlled human studies

B: Animal studies indicate no fetal risk, but no
human studies; or adverse effects in animals, but
not in well-controlled human studies. Category C:
No adequate human or animal studies; or adverse
fetal effects in animal studies, but no available
human data. Category D: Evidence of fetal risk,
but benefits outweigh risks. Category X: Evidence
of fetal risk. Risks outweigh any benefits.

properties, the naturally occurring belladonna alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine, hyoscyamine), some
antihistamines with anticholinergic properties, and
synthetics such as benztropin (Cogentin), procyclidine
(Kemadrin) and biperiden (Akineton) are members of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

this group. Although the anticholinergic drugs have only
limited activity against Parkinson’s disease, they are
useful in the early stages, and may be adjuncts to levodopa as the disease progresses.
Amantadine (Symmetrel), was developed for prevention of influenza virus infection, but has antiParkinsonian properties. Its mechanism of action is
not known.
Bromocriptine (Parlodel) is a prolactin inhibitor,
which is used for a variety of indications including
amenorrhea/galactorrhea, female infertility, and acromegaly. It appears to work by direct stimulation of the
dopamine receptors. Bromocriptine is used as a late
adjunct to levodopa therapy, and may permit reduction in levodopa dosage. Pergolide (Permax) is similar
to bromocriptine, but has not been studied as extensively in Parkinson’s disease.
Entacapone (Comtan) appears to act by maintaining levels of dopamine through enzyme inhibition. It is used as an adjunct to levodopa was the
patient is beginning to experience the on-off effect.
Tolcapone (Tasmar) is a similar agent, but has
demonstrated the potential for inducing severe
liver failure. As such, tolcapone is reserved for
cases where all other adjunctive therapies have
failed or are contraindicated.
Selegeline (Carbex, Eldepryl) is a selective monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor, however its
mechanism of action in Parkinsonism is unclear,
since other drugs with MAO-B inhibition have failed
to show similar anti-Parkinsonian effects. Selegeline is
used primarily as an adjunct to levodopa, although
some studies have indicated that the drug may be
useful in the early stages of Parkinsonism, and may
delay the progression of the disease.
Pramipexole (Mirapex) and ropinirole (Requip)
are believed to act by direct stimulation of the dopamine receptors in the brain. They may be used alone in
early Parkison’s disease, or as adjuncts to levodopa in
advanced stages.

Recommended dosage
Dosages of anti-Parkinsonian medications must
be highly individualized. All doses must be carefully
titrated. Consult specific references.

Precautions
There are a large number of drugs and drug
classes used to treat Parkinson’s disease, and individual references should be consulted.

Antiparkinson drugs

KEY TERMS

Antiprotozoal drugs

The anticholinergics have a large number of
adverse effects, all related to their primary mode of
activity. Their cardiovascular effects include tachycardia, palpitations, hypotension, postural hypotension,
and mild bradycardia. They may also cause a wide
range of central nervous system effects, including
disorientation, confusion, memory loss, hallucinations,
psychoses, agitation, nervousness, delusions, delirium,
paranoia, euphoria, excitement, lightheadedness,
dizziness, headache, listlessness, depression, drowsiness,
weakness, and giddiness. Dry mouth, dry eyes and
gastrointestinal distress are common problems.
Sedation has been reported with some drugs in this
group, but this may be beneficial in patients who suffer
from insomnia. Pregnancy risk factor is C. Because
anticholinergic drugs may inhibit milk production,
their use during breastfeeding is not recommended.
Patients should be warned that anticholinergic medications will inhibit perspiration, and so exercise during
periods of high temperature should be avoided.
Levodopa has a large number of adverse effects.
Anorexia, loss of appetite, occurs in roughly half the
patients using this drug. Symptoms of gastrointestinal
upset, such as nausea and vomiting, have been reported
in 80% of cases. Other reported effects include
increased hand tremor; headache; dizziness; numbness;
weakness and faintness; bruxism; confusion; insomnia; nightmares; hallucinations and delusions; agitation and anxiety; malaise; fatigue and euphoria.
Levodopa has not been listed under the pregnancy
risk factor schedules, but should be used with caution.
Breastfeeding is not recommended.
Amantadine is generally well tolerated, but may
cause dizziness and nausea. It is classified as pregnancy
schedule C. Since amantadine is excreted in breast
milk, breastfeeding while taking amantidine is not
recommended.
Pergolide and bromocriptine have been generally
well tolerated. Orthostatic hypotension are common
problems, and patients must be instructed to risk
slowly from bed. This problem can be minimized by
low initial doses with small dose increments.
Hallucinations may be a problem. Bromocriptine has
not been evaluated for pregnancy risk, while pergolide
is category B. Since both drugs may inhibit lactation,
breastfeeding while taking these drugs is not
recommended.
Pramipexole and ropinirole cause orthostatic
hypotension, hallucinations and dizziness. The two
drugs are in pregnancy category C. In animals, ropinirole has been shown to have adverse effects on
embryo-fetal development, including teratogenic
334

effects, decreased fetal body weight, increased fetal
death and digital malformation. Because these drugs
inhibit prolactin secretion, they should not be taken
while breastfeeding.

Side effects
The most common side effects are associated with
the central nervous system, and include dizziness,
lightheadedness, mood changes and hallucinations.
Gastrointestinal problems, including nausea and
vomiting, are also common.

Interactions
All anti-Parkinsonian regimens should be carefully reviewed for possible drug interactions. Note
that combination therapy with anti-Parkinsonian
drugs is, in itself, use of additive and potentiating
interactions between drugs, and so careful dose adjustment is needed whenever a drug is added or
withdrawn.

I Antiprotozoal drugs
Definition
Antiprotozoal drugs are medicines that treat
infections caused by protozoa.

Purpose
Antiprotozoal drugs are used to treat a variety of
diseases caused by protozoa. Protozoa are animallike, one-celled animals, such as amoebas. Some are
parasites that cause infections in the body. African
sleeping sickness, giardiasis, amebiasis, Pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia (PCP), and malaria are examples of
diseases caused by protozoa.

Description
Antiprotozoal drugs come in liquid, tablet, and
injectable forms and are available only with a doctor’s
prescription. Some commonly used antiprotozoal
drugs are metronidazole (Flagyl), eflornithine
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Amebiasis—An infection caused by an ameba,
which is a type of protozoan.
Fetus—A developing baby inside the womb.
Giardiasis—A condition in which the intestines are
infected with Giardia lamblia, a type of protozoan.
Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat
that usually develop in response to injury or illness.
Parasite—An organism that lives and feeds in or on
another organism (the host) and does nothing to
benefit the host.
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia—A severe
lung infection caused by a parasitic protozoan.
The disease mainly affects people with weakened
immune systems, such as people with AIDS.

(Ornidyl), furazolidone (Furoxone), hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), iodoquinol (Diquinol, Yodoquinol,
Yodoxin), and pentamidine (Pentam 300).

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
antiprotozoal drug, its strength, and the medical problem for which it is being used. Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who
filled the prescription for the correct dosage. Always
take antiprotozoal drugs exactly as directed.

Precautions
Some people feel dizzy, confused, lightheaded, or
less alert when using these drugs. The drugs may also
cause blurred vision and other vision problems. For
these reasons, anyone who takes these drugs should
not drive, use machines or do anything else that might
be dangerous until they have found out how the drugs
affect them.

The physician should also be told about any allergies
to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
Some antiprotozoal drugs may cause problems with
the blood. This can increase the risk of infection or
excessive bleeding. Patients taking these drugs shouldbe
careful not to injure their gums when brushing or flossing their teeth or using a toothpick. They shouldcheck
with the physician before having any dentalwork done.
Care should also be taken to avoidcuts from razors, nail
clippers, or kitchen knives, orhousehold tools. Anyone
who has any of these symptoms while taking antiprotozoal drugs should call the physician immediately:


Fever or chills



Signs of cold or flu



Signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or
inflammation



Unusual bruising or bleeding



Black, tarry stools



Blood in urine or stools



Pinpoint red spots on the skin



Unusual tiredness or weakness.

Anyone taking this medicine should also check with
a physician immediately if any of these symptoms occur:


Blurred vision or other vision changes



Skin rash, hives, or itching



Swelling of the neck



Clumsiness or unsteadiness



Numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness in the hands
or feet



Decrease in urination.

Children are especially sensitive to the effects of
some antiprotozoal drugs. Never give this medicine to a
child unless directed to do so by a physician, and always
keep this medicine out of the reach of children. Use
safety vials.

The antiprotozoal drug furazolidone may cause
very dangerous side effects when taken with certain
foods or beverages. Likewise, metronidazole (Flagyl)
can cause serious liver damage if taken with alcohol.
Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or
the pharmacist who filled the prescription for a list of
products to avoid while taking these medicines.

The effects of antiprotozoal drugs on pregnant
women have not been studied. However, in experiments with pregnant laboratory animals, some antiprotozoal drugs cause birth defects or death of the
fetus. Women who are pregnant or who plan to
become pregnant should check with their physicians
before taking antiprotozoal drugs. Mothers who are
breastfeeding should also check with their physicians
about the safety of taking these drugs.

Anyone who has ever had unusual reactions to
antiprotozoal drugs or related medicines should let his
or her physician know before taking the drugs again.

Before using antiprotozoal drugs, people with any
of these medical problems should make sure their
physicians are aware of their conditions:

I Antipsychotic drugs
Definition
Antipsychotic drugs are a class of medicines used
to treat psychosis and other mental and emotional
conditions.

Purpose
Psychosis is defined as ‘‘a serious mental disorder
(as schizophrenia) characterized by defective or lost
contact with reality often with hallucinations or delusions.’’ Psychosis is an end-stage condition arising
from a variety of possible causes. Anti-psychotic
drugs control the symptoms of psychosis, and in
many cases are effective in controlling the symptoms
of other disorders that may lead to psychosis, including bipolar mood disorder (formerly termed manicdepressive), in which the patient cycles from severe
depression to feelings of extreme excitation. This
class of drugs is primarily composed of the major
tranquilizers; however, lithium carbonate, a drug
that is largely specific to bipolar mood disorder, is
commonly classified among the antipsychotic agents.

Description
The antipsychotic agents may be divided by chemical class. The phenothiazines are the oldest group,
and include chlorpromazine (Thorazine), mesoridazine

(Serentil), prochlorperazine (Compazine), and thioridazine (Mellaril). These drugs are essentially similar in
action and adverse effects. They may also be used as
anti-emetics, although prochlorperazine is the drug
most often used for this indication.
The phenylbutylpiperadines are haloperidol
(Haldol) and pimozide (Orap). They find primary
use in control of Tourette’s syndrome. Haloperidol
has been extremely useful in controlling aggressive
behavior.
The debenzapine derivatives, clozapine (Clozaril),
loxapine (Loxitane), olanzapine (Zyprexa) and quetiapine (Seroquel), have been effective in controlling psychotic symptoms that have not been responsive to
other classes of drugs.
The benzisoxidil group is composed of resperidone
(Resperidal) and ziprasidone (Geodon). Resperidone
has been found useful for controlling bipolar mood
disorder, while ziprasidone is used primarily as second-line treatment for schizophrenia.
In addition to these drugs, the class of antipsychotic agents includes lithium carbonate (Eskalith,
Lithonate), which is used for control of bipolar
mood disorder, and thiothixene (Navane), which is
used in the treatment of psychosis.

Newer agents
Some newer antipsychotic drugs have been
approved by the Food and Drug administration
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Agranulocytosis—An acute condition marked by
severe depression of the bone marrow, which produces white blood cells, and by prostration, chills,
swollen neck, and sore throat sometimes with local
ulceration. Aalso called agranulocytic angina or
granulocytopenia.
Anticholinergic—Blocking the action of the neurohormone acetylcholine. The most obvious effects
include dry mouth and dry eyes.
Anticonvulsants—A class of drugs given to control
seizures.
Pregnancy category—A system of classifying drugs
according to their established risks for use during
pregnancy. Category A: Controlled human studies
have demonstrated no fetal risk. Category B: Animal
studies indicate no fetal risk, but no human studies,
or adverse effects in animals, but not in well-controlled human studies. Category C: No adequate
human or animal studies, or adverse fetal effects in
animal studies, but no available human data.
Category D: Evidence of fetal risk, but benefits outweigh risks. Category X: Evidence of fetal risk. Risks
outweigh any benefits.

(FDA) in the early 2000s. These drugs are sometimes
called second-generation antipsychotics or SGAs.
Aripiprazole (Abilify), which is classified as a partial
dopaminergic agonist, received FDA approval in
August 2003. Two drugs that are still under investigation, a neurokinin antagonist and a serotonin 2A/2C
antagonist respectively, show promise in the treatment
of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.

Recommended dosage
Dose varies with the drug, condition being treated, and patient response. See specific references.

Precautions
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is
a rare, idiosyncratic combination of extra-pyramidal
symptoms (EPS), hyperthermia, and autonomic disturbance. Onset may be hours to months after drug
initiation, but once started, proceeds rapidly over
24 to 72 hours. It is most commonly associated with
haloperidol, long-acting fluphenazine, but has occurred
with thiothixene, thioridazine, and clozapine, and may

occur with other agents. NMS is potentially fatal, and
requires intensive symptomatic treatment and immediate discontinuation of neuroleptic treatment. There is
no established treatment. Most patients who develop
NMS will have the same problem if the drug is
restarted.
Agranulocytosis has been associated with clozapine. This is a potentially fatal reaction, but can be
prevented with careful monitoring of the white blood
count. There are no well-established risk factors for
developing agranulocytosis, and so all patients treated
with this drug must follow the clozapine Patient
Management System. For more information, the
reader should call 1-800-448-5938.
Anticholinergic effects, particularly dry mouth,
have been reported with all of the phenothiazines,
and can be severe enough to cause patients to discontinue their medication.
Photosensitization is a common reaction to chlorpromazine. Patients must be instructed to use precautions when exposed to sunlight.
Lithium carbonate commonly causes increased
frequency of urination.
The so-called atypical antipsychotics are associated with a substantial increase in the risk of developing diabetes mellitus. A study done at the University
of Rochester (New York) reported in 2004 that 15.2%
of patients receiving atypical antipsychotics developed
diabetes, compared with 6.3% of patients taking other
antipsychotic medications.
Antipsychotic drugs are pregnancy category C.
(Clozapine is category B.) The drugs in this class
appear to be generally safe for occasional use at low
doses during pregnancy, but should be avoided near
time of delivery. Although the drugs do not appear
to be teratogenic, when used near term, they may
cross the placenta and have adverse effects on the
newborn infant, including causing involuntary
movements. There is no information about safety
in breast feeding.
As a class, the antipsychotic drugs have a large
number of potential side effects, many of them serious.
Because of the potential severity of side effects, these
drugs must be used with special caution in children.
Specific references should be consulted.

Interactions
Because the phenothiazines have anticholinergic
effects, they should not be used in combination with
other drugs that may have similar effects.
338

Because the drugs in this group may cause hypotension, or low blood pressure, they should be used
with extreme care in combination with blood pressurelowering drugs.
The antipsychotic drugs have a large number of
drug interactions. Consult specific references.

Definition
The atypical antipsychotic agents, sometimes
called the ‘‘novel’’ antipsychotic agents are a group
of drugs which are different chemically from the older
drugs used to treat psychosis. The ‘‘conventional’’
antipsychotic drugs are classified by their chemical
structures as the phenothiazines, thioxanthines
(which are chemically very similar to the phenothiazines), butyrophenones, diphenylbutylpiperadines
and the indolones. All of the atypical antipsychotic
agents are chemically classified as dibenzepines. They
are considered atypical or novel because they have
different side effects from the conventional antipsychotic agents. The atypical drugs are far less likely to
cause extra-pyrammidal side-effects(EPS), drug
induced involuntary movements, than are the older
drugs. The atypical antipsychotic drugs may also be
effective in some cases that are resistant to older drugs.
The drugs in this group are clozapine (Clozaril),
loxapine (Loxitane), olanzapine (Zyprexa), and quetiapine (Seroquel).

KEY TERMS
Anxiety—An abnormal and overwhelming sense of
apprehension and fear often marked by physiological
signs (as sweating, tension, and increased pulse), by
doubt concerning the reality and nature of the threat,
and by self-doubt about one’s capacity to cope with it.
Delusions—A false belief regarding the self or persons or objects outside the self that persists despite
the facts.
Depression—A state of being depressed marked
especially by sadness, inactivity, difficulty with
thinking and concentration, a significant increase or
decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping, feelings
of dejection and hopelessness, and sometimes suicidal thoughts or an attempt to commit suicide.
Glucocorticoid—Any of a group of corticosteroids
(as hydrocortisone or dexamethasone) that are antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive, and that
are used widely in medicine (as in the alleviation
of the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis).
Psychosis—A serious mental disorder characterized by defective or lost contact with reality often
with hallucinations or delusions.

Purpose
The antipsychotic drugs are used to treat severe
emotional disorders. Although there may be different
names for these disorders, depending on severity and
how long the symptoms last, psychotic disorders all
cause at least one of the following symptoms:
Loxapine has also been used to treat anxiety with
mental depression.

Recommended dosage
The recommended dose depends on the drug, the
patient, and the condition being treated. The normal
practice is to start each patient at a low dose, and
gradually increase the dose until a satisfactory
response is achieved. The odse should be held at the
lowest level that gives satisfactory results.
Clozapine usually requires doses between 300 and
600 milligrams a day, but some people require as much
as 900 milligrams/day. Doses higher than 900 millgrams/day are not recommended.
Loxapine is usually effective at doses of 60-100
milligrams/day, but may be used in doses as high as
250 mg/day if needed.
Olanzapine doses vary with the condition being
treated. The usual maximum dose is 20 milligrams/day.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Quetiapine may be dosed anywhere from 150-750
milligrams/day, depending on how well the patient
responds.

Precautions
Although the atypical antipsychotics are generally
safe, clozapine has been associated with severe agranulocytosis, a shortage of white blood cells. For this
reason, people who may be treated with clozapine
should have blood counts before starting the drug,
blood counts every week for as long as they are using
clozapine, and blood counts every week for the first
4 weeks after they stop taking clozapine. If there is any
evidence of a drop in the white blood count while using
clozapine, the drug should be stopped.
Atypical antipsychotics should not be used in
patients with liver damage, brain or circulatory problems, or some types of blood problems.
Allergies
People who have had an allergic reaction to one of
the atypical antipsychotics should not use that

medication again. However, sometimes it is possible to
use a different drug from the same group safely.

Definition

Pregnancy
The atypical antipsychotics have not been proved
safe in pregnancy. They should be used only when
clearly needed and when potential benefits outweigh
potential hazards to the fetus. These drugs have not
been reported in human milk.

Side effects
Although the atypical antipsychotics are less
likely to cause involuntary movements than the older
antipsychotic drugs, they still have a large number of
adverse effects. The following list is not complete.
Review each drug individually for a full list of possible
adverse effects.

Interactions
Taking atypical antipsychotic medications with
certain other drugs may affect the way the drugs work
or may increase the chance of side effects. While taking
antipsychotic drugs, do not take any other prescription
or nonprescription (over-the-counter) drugs without
first checking with a physician.
Because the atypical antipsychotics may cause
lowering of blood pressure, care should be used when
these drugs are taken at the same time as other drugs
which lower blood pressure.
Quetiapine has many interactions. Doses should
be carefully adjusted when quetiapine is used with
ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, erythromycin, carbamazepine, barbiturates, rifampin or glucocorticoids including prednisone, dexamethasone and
methylprednisolone.
These drugs will also require dose adjustments
when used with anti-Parkinson medications.

I Anti-rejection drugs
Anti-rejection drugs are daily medications taken by
organ transplant patients to prevent organ rejection.

Purpose
Anti-rejection drugs, which are also called immunosuppressants, help to suppress the immune system’s
response to a new organ. When a new organ is placed
inside a patient s body, the patient’s immune system
recognizes the organ as foreign tissue and tries to reject it.

Description
When a physician prescribes anti-rejection drugs,
the patient’s risk of rejection and susceptibility to side
effects are considered. The most common drugs prescribed to prevent organ rejection are cyclosporine,
prednisone, azathioprine, tacrolimus or FK506,
mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus, and OKT3, as well
as ATGAM and Thymoglobulin. As is true with all
medications, each of these drugs has benefits and
drawbacks. Cyclosporine, which is one of the most
frequently used anti-rejection drugs, is usually combined with prednisone. An extremely powerful medicine, cyclosporine is usually taken by a patient over the
course of his or her lifetime. Cortisol, which is the
naturally produced form of prednisone in a person’s
body, helps the body manage stress, such as infections
or organ rejection. Taking prednisone results in less
cortisol production in a person’s body, thus minimizing
the risk of rejection. Azathioprine, which needs to be
taken with food to avoid stomach upset, is frequently
combined with cyclosporine, prednisone, or tacrolimus.
Mycophenolate mofetil is a relatively new immunosuppressant that is similar to azathioprine; therefore, the
two drugs should not be taken together. It is preferable
to take mycophenolate mofetil on an empty stomach;
however, like azathioprine, it can be taken with food
because it, too, can cause stomach problems, such as
heartburn and nausea. Like azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil is not a stand-alone drug; instead, it must be
used, in combination with other medications. This is
also the case with regard to sirolimus.
Physicians prescribe either mycophenolate mofetil
or azathioprine (in combination with other immunosuppressant drugs) to help patients cope with acute
bouts of organ rejection. The medications work by
interfering with the multiplication process of white
blood cells, which is part of the body’s natural defense
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

OKT3 prevents is prescribed to prevent organ rejection immediately after surgery and is also used to treat
acute rejection episodes; ATGAM and Thymoglobulin,
which are similar to OKT3, are used for the same reasons. All three drugs are given intravenously.
Tacrolimus, which is also known as FK506, is a
fairly new drug that is considered by many experts to
be as effective as cyclosporine. An alternative drug
choice for patients that cannot tolerate cyclosporine,
tacrolimus has been the subject of much research in
recent years. Used to treat rejection episodes that are
acute or chronic in nature, tacrolimus is being studied
to see if using it will allow patients to reduce their
dosage of prednisone without organ rejection.
In a presentation at the 2003 American
Transplant Congress, surgeons from the University
of Pittsburgh reported that an innovative clinical protocol developed by Dr. Thomas E. Starzl was implemented, which reduced the dosage of tacrolimus
needed by lung transplant patients with excellent success. Patients required lower doses of prednisone as
well. In fact, in some cases, patients were taking tacrolimus only once a day (rather than twice a day) or only
four times a week. Over the long-term, physicians
hope that there will be less risk of lung recipients
developing the kinds of complications normally associated with high levels of immunosuppressants, such
as kidney dysfunction, which is a common problem
faced by lung transplant patients.
Dr. Thomas E. Strazl, the renowned physician
often referred to as the modern-day father of transplantation, developed the protocol based on the knowledge
that some of his patients had stopped taking their daily
pills with no ill effects. Starzl theorized that giving several drugs to a patient immediately after surgery, which
was the normal practice, might inhibit the immune system from developing a tolerance for the new organ.
Therefore, his new protocol embraced a different
approach. Shortly before the transplantation, patients
were given a drug that killed their T-cells and after the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

operation, patients received only one anti-rejection
medicine rather than the multi-pill cocktail normally
prescribed. In an article published by Lancet in 2003,
Starzl and colleagues reported the results of their pilot
study involving 82 two kidney, liver, pancreas or small
bowel transplant patients treated according to the new
drug protocol. Out of the 72 patients with successful
transplants after one year, over half the patients were
taking anti-rejection medication either every other day,
three times per week or twice per week. Amazingly, 11 of
the patients were taking only one pill a week and they
exhibited no signs of organ rejection or complications.
Certainly more research needs to be conducted, but
these results are very promising.

Recommended dosage
The dosages vary depending on the drug or drug
combination being taken by the patient. In general,
cyclosporine is taken every 12 hours in liquid or capsule
form. Tacrolimus is generally taken every 12 hours as
well. The level of either drug in a patient’s blood is
monitored carefully and doses are adjusted accordingly
in order to not only prevent reject, but also unpleasant
side effects. Azathioprine is taken once a day in tablet
form, whereas mycophenolate mofetil is generally taken
every 12 hours. High doses of prednisone are usually
given at first and then tapered down slowly.

Precautions
Patients should discuss proper storage methods
with regard to their medications. Sirolimus, for example, should be stored at room temperature with special
care taken to keep it out of excessive heat and humidity.
Although pregnant women taking anti-rejection
drugs have delivered healthy babies, women planning
on becoming pregnant while taking anti-rejection
drugs should talk with their physicians regarding any
possible complications. For example, the safety of
taking mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy or
while breastfeeding is questionable and not advised.

Side effects
Side effects vary depending on the individual and
the drug therapy chosen. Patients should talk with
their doctors regarding the various side effects they
can expect and under what conditions emergency
medical care needs to be sought.

Interactions
It is essential that patients talk with their pharmacist and transplant team before taking any medications,

system when foreign invaders, such as a new organ, are
detected. However, researchers at Duke University
and the University of Florida found that mycophenolate mofetil doesn’t work any better than azathioprine,
but costs significantly more. Aside from cost, another
consideration also needs to be the type of organ transplanted, because acute rejection rates differ. For
example, six months after surgery, approximately
15% of kidney recipients will have an acute rejection
episode as compared to approximately 60% of lung
recipients. And because study results vary depending
on the organ transplanted, more research is needed
with regard to the success of mycophenolate mofetil as
compared to azathioprine.

Antiretroviral drugs

regardless of whether they are prescription or over-thecounter drugs to ensure that the combinations will
not interact. For example, antacids can diminish the
effectiveness of mycophenolate mofetil and drugs used
to treat high cholesterol may increase the potency of
sirolimus. In addition, certain food products can also
alter the potency of some anti-rejection drugs. For
example, grapefruit and grapefruit juice can cause
cyclosporine blood levels to increase.

I Antiretroviral drugs
Definition
Antiretroviral drugs inhibit the reproduction of
retroviruses—viruses composed of RNA rather than
DNA. The best known of this group is HIV, human
immunodeficiency virus, the causative agent of AIDS.
342

Purpose
Antiretroviral agents are virustatic agents which
block steps in the replication of the virus. The drugs
are not curative; however continued use of drugs,
particularly in multi-drug regimens, significantly
slows disease progression.

Description
There are three main types of antiretroviral drugs,
although only two steps in the viral replication process
are blocked. Nucleoside analogs, or nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as didanosine
(ddI, Videx), lamivudine (3TC, Epivir), stavudine
(d4T, Zerit), zalcitabine (ddC, Hivid), and zidovudine
(AZT, Retrovir), act by inhibiting the enzyme reverse
transcriptase. Because a retrovirus is composed of
RNA, the virus must make a DNA strand in order to
replicate itself. Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that
is essential to making the DNA copy. The nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors are incorporated into
the DNA strand. This is a faulty DNA molecule that is
incapable of reproducing.
The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
(NNRTIs), such as delavirdine (Rescriptor), loviride,
and nevirapine (Viramune) act by binding directly to
the reverse transcriptase molecule, inhibiting its
activity.
A fourth class of drugs was under clinical trials in
2003. Called fusion inhibitors, they block HIV from
fusing with healthy cells. The first to receive FDA
approval will likely be a drug called Enfurvitide.
Because HIV mutates readily, the virus can
develop resistance to single drug therapy. However,
treatment with drug combinations appears to produce
a durable response. Proper treatment appears to
slow the progression of HIV infections and reduce
the frequency of opportunistic infections. One of the
most notable advances in recent years has been the
success of highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART). This multidrug approach reduced the
risk of opportunistic infections in persons with HIV/
AIDS and slowed the progression of the disease and
death. Usually, patients receive triple combination
therapy, however research in 2003 showed a new
once-daily regimen of quadruple therapy effective.
The combination included adefovir, lamivudine,
didanosine, and efavirenz. In short, the scientific community continues to make rapid advancements in
developing and evaluating antiretroviral drug therapy.
It is best to keep well informed and frequently check
with a physician.

Recommended dosage
Doses must be individualized based on the patient
and use of interacting drugs. The optimum combinations of antiretroviral drugs have not been determined,
nor is there agreement on the stage of infection at
which to start treatment. In fact, starting treatment
too early has led to unwanted side effects in some
patients or problems with patient readiness to comply.
Treatment should begin when the time and circumstances are right.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Although the antiretroviral drugs fall into several
groups, each drug has a unique pattern of adverse
effects and drug interactions. Since the drugs are used
in various combinations, the frequency and severity
of adverse effects will vary with the combination.
Although most drug combinations show a higher
rate of adverse events than single drug therapy,
some patterns are not predictable. For example, indinavir has been reported to cause insomnia in 3% of
patients, however, when used in combination with
zidovudine, only 1.5% of patients complained of
sleep difficulties.
The most severe adverse effects associated with
the protease inhibitors are kidney and liver toxicity.
Patients also have reported a syndrome of abdominal
distention (selling and expansion) and increased body
odor, which may be socially limiting. Hemophilic
patients have reported increased bleeding tendencies
while taking protease inhibitors. The drugs are pregnancy category B. There have been no controlled studies of safety in pregnancy. HIV-infected mothers are
advised not to breast feed in order to prevent transmission of the virus to the newborn.
The nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
have significant levels of toxicity. Lactic acidosis in
the absence of hypoxemia and severe liver enlargement
with fatty degeneration have been reported with zidovudine and zalcitabine, and are potentially fatal. Rare
cases of liver failure, considered possibly related to
underlying hepatitis B and zalcitabine monotherapy,
have been reported.
Abacavir has been associated with fatal hypersensitivity reactions. Didanosine has been associated
with severe pancreatitis. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors are pregnancy category C.
There is limited information regarding safety during
pregnancy. Zidovudine has been used during pregnancy to reduce the risk of HIV infection to the
infant. HIV-infected mothers are advised not to
breast feed in order to prevent transmission of the
virus to the newborn.
Efavirenz has been associated with a high frequency of skin rash, 27% in adults and 40% in children. Nevirapine has been associated with severe liver
damage and skin reactions. All of the non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors are pregnancy category C, based on animal studies.
Using antiretroviral drugs in combination also
helps lower risk of developing viral resistance. Fifty

Rheumatoid arthritis is a progressive form of
arthritis that has devastating effects on joints and
general health. It is classified as an auto-immune disease, because the disease is caused by the body’s own
immune system acting against the body itself.
Symptoms include painful, stiff, swollen joints, fever,
fatigue, and loss of appetite.
In recent years, there has been a change in attitude
concerning the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Physicians now use Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic
Drugs (DMARDs) early in the history of the disease and
are less inclined to wait for crippling stages before resorting to the more potent drugs. Fuller understanding of the
side-effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) has also stimulated reliance on other types
of antirheumatic drugs.

Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage depends on the type of
drug. The prescribing physician or the pharmacist
provide information for the correct dosage. The
drugs must be taken exactly as directed.
When taking methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis, it should be taken only once or twice a week as
prescribed, not every day. Taking it every day can lead
to a fatal overdose.

Precautions
Many antirheumatic drugs such as, for example,
azathioprine
(Imuran)
and
methotrexate
(Rheumatrex), are very powerful drugs. They are
usually prescribed in severe cases, when all other treatments have failed. Thus, they may have serious side
effects, so it is important to be monitored closely by a
physician while taking any of these drugs.

Interactions
Antirheumatic drugs may interact with a variety of
other medicines or other antirheumatic drugs. When this
happens, the effects of one or both of the drugs may
change, or the risk of side effects may be greater. Anyone
who takes this type of drug should inform the prescribing
physician about any other medication he or she is taking.
Among the drugs that may interact with antirheumatic
drugs are phenytoin (Dilantin), aspirin, sulfa drugs such
as Bactrim and Gantrisin, tetracycline and some other
antibiotics and cimetidine (Tagamet). NSAIDs such as
ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) are also known to interact
with other classes of antirheumatic drugs.

Methotrexate and penicillamine may cause birth
defects. Women taking these drugs must stop taking
them during pregnancy and for several months before
a planned pregnancy. Methotrexate may also cause
lung damage or fertility problems and should not be
taken by anyone with serious kidney or liver disease or
by anyone who drinks alcohol.
Azathioprine may cause birth defects if either the
man or woman is using it at the time of conception.
Anyone who uses this drug and is sexually active
should consult with a physician about an effective
birth control method.
Other common side effects of antirheumatic drugs
include abdominal cramps, diarrhea, dizziness, loss of
appetite, headache, nausea, vomiting, fever and chills,
and mouth sores. A variety of other side effects may
occur. Anyone who has unusual symptoms while taking

I Antiseptics
Definition
An antiseptic is a substance which inhibits the
growth and development of microorganisms. For
practical purposes, antiseptics are routinely thought
of as topical agents, for application to skin, mucous
membranes, and inanimate objects, although a formal
definition includes agents which are used internally,
such as the urinary tract antiseptics.

Purpose
Antiseptics are a diverse class of drugs which are
applied to skin surfaces or mucous membranes for
their anti-infective effects. This may be either bacteriocidal or bacteriostatic. Their uses include cleansing
of skin and wound surfaces after injury, preparation of
skin surfaces prior to injections or surgical procedures,
and routine disinfection of the oral cavity as part of a
program of oral hygiene. Antiseptics are also used for
disinfection of inanimate objects, including instruments and furniture surfaces.
Commonly used antiseptics for skin cleaning
include benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine, hexachlorophine, iodine compounds, mercury compounds,
alcohol and hydrogen peroxide. Other agents which
have been used for this purpose, but have largely been
supplanted by more effective or safer agents, include

boric acid and volatile oils such as methyl salicylate
(oil of wintergreen.)

Skin dryness and irritation should be considered
with all products, but particularly with those containing alcohol.

Chlorhexidine shows a high margin of safety when
applied to mucous membranes, and has been used in
oral rinses and preoperative total body washes.

Systemic toxicity may result from ingestion of
iodine containing compounds or mercury compounds.

Benzalkonium chloride and hexachlorophine are
used primarily as hand scrubs or face washes.
Benzalkonium may also find application is a disinfecting agent for instruments, and in low concentration as
a preservative for drugs including ophthalmic solutions. Benzalkonium chloride is inactivated by organic
compounds, including soap, and must not be applied
to areas which have not been fully rinsed.
Iodine compounds include tincture of iodine and
povidone iodine compounds. Iodine compounds have
the broadest spectrum of all topical anti-infectives, with
action against bacteria, fungi, viruses, spores, protozoa,
and yeasts. Iodine tincture is highly effective, but its
alcoholic component is drying and extremely irritating
when applied to abraided (scraped or rubbed) skin.
Povidone iodine, an organic compound, is less irritating
and less toxic, but not as effective. Povidone iodine has
been used for hand scrubs and disinfection of surgical
sites. Aqueous solutions of iodine have also been used
as antiseptic agents, but are less effective than alcoholic
solutions and less convenient to use that the povidone
iodine compounds.
Hydrogen peroxide acts through the liberation of
oxygen gas. Although the antibacterial activity of hydrogen peroxide is relatively weak, the liberation of oxygen
bubbles produces an effervescent action, which may be
useful for wound cleansing through removal of tissue
debris. The activity of hydrogen peroxide may be
reduced by the presence of blood and pus. The appropriate concentration of hydrogen peroxide for antiseptic
use is 3%, although higher concentrations are available.
Thimerosol (Mersol) is a mercury compound with
activity against bacteria and yeasts. Prolonged use
may result in mercury toxicity.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Chlorhexidine should not be instilled into the ear.
There is one anecdotal report of deafness following
use of chlorhexidine in a patient with a perforated
eardrum. Safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding have
not been reported, however there is one anecdotal
report of an infant developing slowed heartbeat
apparently related to maternal use of chlorhexidine.
Iodine compounds should be used sparingly
during pregnancy and lactation due to risk of infant
absorption of iodine with alterations in thyroid function.

Interactions
Antiseptics are not known to interact with any
other medicines. However, they should not be used
together with any other topical cream, solution, or
ointment.

KEY TERMS

Antispasmodic drugs

KEY TERMS
Heat stroke—A serious condition that results from
exposure to extreme heat. The body loses its ability
to cool itself. Severe headache, high fever, and hot,
dry skin may result. In severe cases, a person with
heat stroke may collapse or go into a coma.
Hiatal hernia—A condition in which part of the
stomach protrudes through the diaphragm.
Hyperthyroidism—Secretion of excess thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland.
Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat
that usually develop in response to injury or illness.
Myasthenia gravis—A condition in which certain
muscles weaken and may become paralyzed.
Reflux esophagitis—Inflammation of the lower
esophagus caused by the backflow of stomach
contents.
Spasm—Sudden, involuntary tensing of a muscle or
a group of muscles
Ulcerative colitis—Long-lasting and repeated
inflammation of the colon with the development
of sores.

Purpose
Antispasmodic drugs have been used to treat
stomach cramps. Traditionally, they were used to
treat stomach ulcers, but for this purpose they have
largely been replaced by the acid inhibiting
compoundsa, the H-2 receptor blockers such as
cimetidine and ranitidine and the proton pump
inhibtors such as omeprazole, lansoprazole and
rabetazole.
Most of the drugs used for this purpose as ‘‘anticholinergics’’, since they counteract the effects of the
neurohormone acetylcholine. Some of these drugs are
derived from the plant belladonna, also known as
Deadly Nightshade. There is also a group of drugs
with similar activity, but not taken from plant sources.
The anticholingergics decrease both the movements of
the stomach and intestine, and also the secretions of
stomach acid and digestive enzymes. They may be
used for other purposes including treatment of
Parkinson’s Disease, and bladder urgency. Because
these drugs inhibit secretions, they cause dry mouth
and dry eyes because of reduced salivation and tearing. Dicyclomine is an antispasmodic with very lettle
348

effect on secretions. It is used to treat irritable bowel
syndrome.

Description
Dicyclomine is available only with a prescription
and is sold as capsules, tablets (regular and extendedrelease forms), and syrup.

Recommended dosage
The usual dosage for adults is 20 mg, four times a
day. However, the physician may recommend starting
at a lower dosage and gradually increasing the dose to
reduce the chance of unwanted side effects.
The dosage for children depends on the child’s
age. Check with the child’s physician for the correct
dosage.

Precautions
Dicyclomine makes some people sweat less,
which allows the body to overheat and may lead to
heat prostration (fever and heat stroke). Anyone
taking this drug should try to avoid extreme heat.
If that is not possible, check with the physician
who prescribed the drug. If heat prostration occurs,
stop taking the medicine and call a physician
immediately.
This medicine can cause drowsiness and blurred
or double vision. People who take this drug should not
drive, use machines, or do anything else that might be
dangerous until they have found out how the medicine
affects them.
Dicyclomine should not be given to infants or
children unless the physician decides the use of this
drug is necessary. Diclyclomine should not be used by
women who are breast feeding. Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant should check with
their physicians before using this drug.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Tuberculosis is a disease caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculae, a bacteria that is passed between people
through the air. The disease can be cured with proper
drug therapy, but because the bacteria may become
resistant to any single drug, combinations of antituberculosis drugs are used to treat tuberculosis (TB) are
normally required for effective treatment. At the start
of the 20th Century, tuberculosis was the most common
cause of death in the United States, but was laregly
eliminated with better living conditions. It is most common in areas of crowding and poor ventilation, suich as
crowded urban areas and prisons. In some areas, the
AIDS epidemic has been accompanied by an increase
in the prevalence of tuberculosis.
Some antituberculosis drugs also are used to treat
or prevent other infections such as Mycobacterium
avium complex (MAC), which causes disease throughout the bodies of people with AIDS or other diseases
of the immune system.

Description
Antituberculosis drugs are available only with a
physician’s prescription and come in tablet, capsule,
liquid and injectable forms. Some commonly used
antituberculosis drugs are cycloserine (Seromycin),
ethambutol (Myambutol), ethionamide (TrecatorSC), isoniazid (Nydrazid, Laniazid), pyrazinamide,
rifabutin (Mycobutin), and rifampin (Rifadin,
Rimactane).

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
antituberculosis drug and may be different for different patients. Check with the physician who prescribed
the medicine or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the proper dosage. The physician may gradually increase the dosage during treatment. Be sure to
follow the physician’s orders. Patients who are infected
with HIV must usually take larger combinations of
drugs for a longer period of time than is needed for
patients with an unimpaired immune system.

In addition, patients with these conditions should
check with their physicians before using dicyclomine:

Antituberculosis drugs

KEY TERMS
Bacteria—Tiny, one-celled forms of life that cause
many diseases and infections.
Feces—(Also called stool.) The solid waste that is
left after food is digested. Feces form in the intestines and pass out of the body through the anus.
Fetus—A developing baby inside the womb.
Gout—A disease in which uric acid, a waste product that normally passes out of the body in urine,
collects in the joints and the kidneys. This causes
arthritis and kidney stones.
Immune system—The body’s natural defenses
against disease and infection.
Microorganism—An organism (life form) that is too
small to be seen with the naked eye.
Platelets—Disk-shaped bodies in the blood that are
important in clotting.
Seizure—A sudden attack, spasm, or convulsion.

Some antituberculosis drugs must be taken with
other drugs. If they are taken alone, they may encourage the bacteria that cause tuberculosis to become
resistant to drugs used to treat the disease. When the
bacteria become resistant, treating the disease
becomes more difficult.

remember to take the medicine during the day, check
with a health care professional for suggestions.
Do not take antacids that contain aluminum, such
as Maalox, within 1 hour of taking isoniazid, as this
may keep the medicine from working.

Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking antituberculosis drugs is important. The physician will check
to make sure the medicine is working as it should and
will watch for unwanted side effects. These visits also
will help the physician know if the dosage needs to be
changed.
Symptoms should begin to improve within a few
weeks after treatment begins with antituberculosis
drugs. If they do not, or if they become worse, check
with a physician.
Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, confused, or less
alert when using these drugs. Some may also cause
vision changes, clumsiness, or unsteadiness. Because
of these possible problems, anyone who takes antituberculosis drugs should not drive, use machines, or do
anything else that might be dangerous until they have
found out how the medicine affects them.
Daily doses of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) may lessen
or prevent some side effects of ethionamide or isoniazid.
If the physician who prescribed the medicine recommends this, be sure to take the pyridoxine every day.

To clear up tuberculosis completely, antituberculosis drugs must be taken for as long as directed. This
may mean taking the medicine every day for a year or
two or even longer. Symptoms may improve very
quickly after treatment with this medicine begins.
However, they may come back if the medicine is
stopped too quickly. Do not stop taking the medicine
just because symptoms improve.

Certain kinds of cheese (such as Swiss and
Cheshire) and fish (such as tuna and skipjack) may
cause an unusual reaction in people taking isoniazid.
Symptoms of this reaction include fast or pounding
heartbeat, sweating or a hot feeling, chills or a clammy
feeling, headache, lightheadedness, and red or itchy skin.
This reaction is very rare. However, if any of these symptoms occur, check with a physician as soon as possible.

Because people may neglect to take their medication for tuberculosis, it is common to have tuberculosis centers develop a program of Directly Observed
Therapy (DOT.) In these programs, patients come to
the hospital or clinic, and take their medication in
front of an observer. These programs may be annoying to the patients, but are justified by the risks to
public health if tuberculosis germs which have become
resistant to drugs were to be spread.

Rifabutin and rifampin will make saliva, sweat,
tears, urine, feces, and skin turn reddish orange to
reddish brown. This is nothing to worry about.
However, the discolored tears may permanently stain
soft contact lenses (but not hard contact lenses). To
avoid ruining contact lenses, do not wear soft contacts
while taking these medicines.

Cycloserine works best when it is at constant
levels in the blood. To help keep levels constant, take
the medicine in doses spaced evenly through the day
and night. Do not miss any doses. If taking medicine at
night interferes with sleep, or if it is difficult to

Rifampin may temporarily lower the number of
white blood cells. Because the white blood cells are
important in fighting infection, this effect increases the
chance of getting an infection. This drug also may
lower the number of platelets that play an important
role in clotting. To reduce the risk of bleeding and
infection in the mouth while taking this medicine, be

Symptoms such as unsteadiness, clumsiness and
pain, numbness, tingling, or burning in the hands or
feet could be the first signs of nerve problems that may
become more serious. If any of these symptoms occur,
check with a physician immediately. Other side effects
that should be brought to a physician’s attention
immediately include yellow eyes or skin and mood or
mental changes such as depression or confusion.
Less serious side effects such as dizziness, nausea
or vomiting, appetite loss, sore mouth, or metallic
taste may also occur. These problems usually go
away as the body adjusts to the medicine. They do
not need medical attention unless they continue or
they interfere with normal activities.
Isoniazid
This medicine may cause serious liver damage, especially in people over 40 years of age. However, taking
medicine for tuberculosis is very important for people
with the disease. Anyone who has tuberculosis and has
been advised to take this drug should thoroughly discuss
treatment options with his or her physician.
Recognizing the early signs of liver and nerve
damage can help prevent the problems from getting
worse. If any of these symptoms occur, check with a
physician immediately:

Other side effects may occur with any antituberculosis drug. Anyone who has unusual symptoms
while taking an antituberculosis drug should get in
touch with his or her physician.

Interactions
Taking cycloserine and ethionamide together may
increase the risk of seizures and other nervous system
problems. These and other side effects also are more
likely in people who drink alcohol while taking cycloserine. To avoid these problems, do not drink alcohol
while taking cycloserine and check with a physician

Purpose
Recurrent gastric and duodenal ulcers are caused
by Helicobacter pylori infections, and are treated
with combination treatments that incorporate antibiotic therapy with gastric acid suppression.
Additionally, bismuth compounds have been used.
The primary class of drugs used for gastric acid
suppression are the proton pump inhibitors, omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole. The
H-2 receptor blocking agents, cimetidine, famotidine,
nizatidine, and ranitidine have been used for this
purpose, but are now more widely used for maintenance therapy after treatment with the proton pump
inhibitors. Sucralfate, which acts by forming a protective coating over the ulcerate lesion, is also used in
ulcer treatment and may be appropriate for patients in
whom other classes of drugs are not indicated, or those
whose gastric ulcers are caused by non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) rather than H. pylori
infections.

Description

I Antiulcer drugs
Definition
‘Antiulcer drugs are a class of drugs, exclusive of
the antibacterial agents, used to treat ulcers in the
stomach and the upper part of the small intestine.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The proton pump inhibitors block the secretion of
gastric acid by the gastric parietal cells. The extent of
inhibition of acid secretion is dose related. In some
cases, gastric acid secretion is completely blocked for
over 24 hours on a single dose. In addition to their role
in treatment of gastric ulcers, the proton pump inhibitors are used to treat syndromes of excessive acid
secretion (Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
353

Antiulcer drugs

KEY TERMS
Antibiotic—Medicine used to treat infections.
Enzyme—A type of protein, produced in the body,
that brings about or speeds up chemical reactions.
Gastrointestinal tract—The stomach, small intestine and large intestine.
Hypersecretory—Excessive production of a bodily
secretion. The most common hypersecretory
syndrome of the stomach is Zollinger-Ellison
Syndrome, a syndrome consisting of fulminating
intractable peptic ulcers, gastric hypersecretion and
hyperacidity, and the occurrence of gastrinomas
of the pancreatic cells of the islets of Langerhans.
Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat
that usually develop in response to injury or illness.

The dose of sucralfate for acute ulcer therapy is
1 gram four times a day. After the ulcer has healed,
maintenance treatment may continue at 1 gram two
times daily.

Precautions
The proton pump inhibitors are generally well
tolerated, and the most common adverse effects are
diarrhea, itching, skin rash, dizziness and headache.
Muscle aches and a higher than normal rate of respiratory infections are among the other adverse reactions
reported. Omeprazole has an increased rate of fetal
deaths in animal studies. It is not known if these drugs
are excreted in human milk, but because of reported
adverse effects to infants in animal studies, it is recommended that proton pump inhibitors not be used by
nursing mothers.

Mucous—Thick fluid produced by the moist membranes that line many body cavities and structures.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)—A
type of medicine used to relieve pain, swelling, and
other symptoms of inflammation, such as ibuprofen
or ketoprofen.

The H-2 receptor blockers vary widely in their
adverse effects. Although they are generally well tolerated, cimetidine may cause confusion in elderly
patients, and has an antiandrogenic effect that may
cause sexual dysfunction in males. Famotidine has
been reported to cause headache in 4.7% of patients.
It is advisable that mothers not take H-2 receptor
blockers while nursing.

Histamine H-2 receptor blockers stop the action
of histamine on the gastric parietal cells, inhibiting the
secretion of gastric acid. These drugs are less effective
than the proton pump inhibitors, but may achieve a
75–79% reduction in acid secretion. Higher rates of
acid inhibition may be achieved when the drug is
administered by the intravenous route. The H-2 receptor blockers may also be used to treat heartburn and
hypersecretory syndromes. When given before surgery, the H-2 receptor blockers are useful in prevention of aspiration pneumonia.

Sucralfate is well tolerated. It is poorly absorbed,
and its most common side effect is constipation in 2%
of patients. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, gastric discomfort, indigestion, flatulence, dry mouth, rash, pruritus (itching), back pain, headache, dizziness,
sleepiness, and vertigo have been reported, as well as
rare allergic responses. Because sucralfate releases
small amounts of aluminum into the system, it should
be used with caution in patients with renal insufficiency. There is no information available about sucralfate’s safety in breastfeeding.

Sucralfate (Carafate), a substituted sugar molecule
with no nutritional value, does not inhibit gastric acid,
but rather, reacts with existing stomach acid to form a
thick coating that covers the surface of an ulcer, protecting the open area from further damage. A secondary
effect is to act as an inhibitor of the digestive enzyme
pepsin. Sucralfate does not bind to the normal stomach
lining. The drug has been used for prevention of stress
ulcers, the type seen in patients exposed to physical stress
such as burns and surgery. It has no systemic effects.

Recommended dosage
The doses of the proton pump inhibitors and H-2
receptor blockers vary depending on the drug and
condition being treated. Consult individual references.
354

Interactions
Proton pump inhibitors may increase the pH of
the stomach. This will inactivate some antifungal
drugs that require an acid medium for effectiveness,
notable itraconazole and ketoconazole.
H-2 receptor blocking agents have a large number
of drug interactions. Consult individualized references.
Sucralfate should not be used with aluminum
containing antacids, because of the risk of increased
aluminum absorption. Sucralfate may inhibit
absorption and reduce blood levels of anticoagulants, digoxin, quinidine, ketoconazole, quinolones
and phenytoin.

I Antiviral drugs
Definition
Antiviral drugs are medicines that cure or control
virus infections.

Purpose
Antivirals are used to treat infections caused by
viruses. Unlike antibacterial drugs, which may cover a
wide range of pathogens, antiviral agents tend to be
narrow in spectrum, and have limited efficacy.

Description
Exclusive of the antiretroviral agents used in HIV
(AIDS) therapy, there are currently only 11 antiviral
drugs available, covering four types of virus. Acyclovir
(Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir
(Valtrex) are effective against herpesvirus, including
herpes zoster and herpes genitalis. They may also be of
value in either conditions caused by herpes, such as
chickenpox and shingles. These drugs are not curative,
but may reduce the pain of a herpes outbreak and
shorten the period of viral shedding.
Amantadine (Symmetrel), oseltamivir (Tamiflu),
rimantidine (Flumadine), and zanamivir (Relenza) are
useful in treatment of influenza virus. Amantadine,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Asthenia—Muscle weakness.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)—A type of virus that
attacks and enlarges certain cells in the body. The
virus also causes a disease in infants.
Herpes simplex—A virus that causes sores on the
lips (cold sores) or on the genitals (genital herpes).
HIV—Acronym for human immunodeficiency
virus, the virus that causes AIDS.
Parkinsonism—A group of conditions that all have
these typical symptoms in common: tremor, rigidity,
slow movement, and poor balance and coordination.
Pregnancy category—A system of classifying drugs
according to their established risks for use during
pregnancy. Category A: Controlled human studies
have demonstrated no fetal risk. Category B: Animal
studies indicate no fetal risk, but no human studies,
or adverse effects in animals, but not in wellcontrolled human studies. Category C: No adequate
human or animal studies, or adverse fetal effects in
animal studies, but no available human data.
Category D: Evidence of fetal risk, but benefits outweigh risks. Category X: Evidence of fetal risk. Risks
outweigh any benefits.
Prophylactic—Guarding from or preventing the
spread or occurrence of disease or infection.
Retrovirus—A group of viruses that contain RNA
and the enzyme reverse transcriptase. Many viruses
in this family cause tumors. The virus that causes
AIDS is a retrovirus.
Shingles—An disease caused by an infection with
the Herpes zoster virus, the same virus that causes
chickenpox. Symptoms of shingles include pain
and blisters along one nerve, usually on the face,
chest, stomach, or back.
Virus—A tiny, disease-causing structure that can
reproduce only in living cells and causes a variety
of infectious diseases.

rimantadine, and oseltamivir may be administered
throughout the flu season as preventatives for patients
who cannot take influenza virus vaccine.
Cidofovir (Vistide), foscarnet (Foscavir), and
ganciclovir (Cytovene) have been beneficial in treatment of cytomegalovirus in immunosupressed
patients, primarily HIV-positive patients and transplant recipients. Ribavirin (Virazole) is used to treat

respiratory syncytial virus. In combination with
interferons, ribavirin has shown some efficacy
against hepatitis C, and there have been anecdotal
reports of utility against other types of viral
infections.
As a class, the antivirals are not curative, and
must be used either prophylactically or early in the
development of an infection. Their mechanism of
action is typically to inactivate the enzymes needed
for viral replication. This will reduce the rate of viral
growth, but will not inactive the virus already present.
Antiviral therapy must normally be initiated within 48
hours of the onset of an infection to provide any
benefit. Drugs used for influenza may be used
throughout the influenza season in high risk patients,
or within 48 hours of exposure to a known carrier.
Antiherpetic agents should be used at the first signs of
an outbreak. Anti-cytomegaloviral drugs must routinely be used as part of a program of secondary prophylaxis (maintenance therapy following an initial
response) in order to prevent reinfection in immunocompromised patients.

Recommended dosage
Dosage varies with the drug, patient age and condition, route of administration, and other factors. See
specific references.

Precautions
Ganciclovir is available in intravenous injection,
oral capsules, and intraoccular inserts. The capsules
should be reserved for prophylactic use in organ transplant patients, or for HIV infected patients who cannot be treated with the intravenous drug. The toxicity
profile of this drug when administered systemically
includes granulocytopenia, anemia and thrombocytopenia. The drug is in pregnancy category C, but has
caused significant fetal abnormalities in animal studies
including cleft palate and organ defects. Breast feeding
is not recommended.
Cidofovir causes renal toxicity in 53% of patients.
Patients should be well hydrated, and renal function
should be checked regularly. Other common adverse
effects are nausea and vomiting in 65% or patients,
asthenia in 46% and headache and diarrhea, both
reported in 27% of cases. The drug is category C in
pregnancy, due to fetal abnormalities in animal
studies. Breast feeding is not recommended.
Foscarnet is used in treatment of immunocompromised patients with cytomegalovirus infections
and in acyclovir-resistant herpes simples virus. The
356

primary hazard is renal toxicity. Alterations in electrolyte levels may cause seizures. Foscarnet is category C during pregnancy. The drug has caused
skeletal abnormailities in developing fetuses. It is
not known whether foscarnet is excreted in breast
milk, however the drug does appear in breast milk in
animal studies.
Valaciclovir is metabolized to acyclovir, so that
the hazards of the two drugs are very similar. They
are generally well tolerated, but nausea and headache
are common adverse effects. They are both pregnancy category B. Although there have been no
reports of fetal abnormalities attributable to either
drug, the small number of reported cases makes it
impossible to draw conclusions regarding safety in
pregnancy. Acyclovir is found in breast milk, but
no adverse effects have been reported in the newborn. Famciclovir is similar in actions and adverse
effects.
Ribavirin is used by aerosol for treatment of hospitalized infants and young children with severe lower
respiratory tract infections due to respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV). When administered orally, the drug has
been used in adultys to treat other viral diseases
including acute and chronic hepatitis, herpes genitalis,
measles, and Lassa fever, however there is relatively
little information about these uses. In rare cases, initiation of ribavirin therapy has led to deterioration of
respiratory function in infants. Careful monitoring is
essential for safe use.
The anti-influenza drugs are generally well tolerated. Amantadine, which is also used for treatment
of Parkinsonism, may show more frequent CNS
effects, including sedation and dizziness. Rapid discontinuation of amantidine may cause an increase in
Parkinsonian symptoms in patients using the drug
for that purpose. All are schedule C for pregnancy.
In animal studies, they have caused fetal malformations in doses several times higher than the normal
human dose. Use caution in breast feeding.

Interactions
Consult specific references for information on
drug interactions.
Use particular caution in HIV-positive patients,
since these patients are commonly on multi-drug regimens with a high frequency of interactions.
Ganciclovir should not be used with other drugs
which cause hematologic toxicity, and cidofovir
should not be used with other drugs that may cause
kidney damage.

I Anxiety
Definition
Anxiety is a multisystem response to a perceived
threat or danger. It reflects a combination of biochemical changes in the body, the patient’s personal history
and memory, and the social situation. As far as we
know, anxiety is a uniquely human experience. Other
animals clearly know fear, but human anxiety involves
an ability, to use memory and imagination to move
backward and forward in time, that animals do
not appear to have. The anxiety that occurs in posttraumatic syndromes indicates that human memory is
a much more complicated mental function than animal memory. Moreover, a large portion of human
anxiety is produced by anticipation of future events.
Without a sense of personal continuity over time,
people would not have the ‘‘raw materials’’ of anxiety.
It is important to distinguish between anxiety as a
feeling or experience, and an anxiety disorder as a
psychiatric diagnosis. A person may feel anxious without having an anxiety disorder. In addition, a person
facing a clear and present danger or a realistic fear is
not usually considered to be in a state of anxiety. In
addition, anxiety frequently occurs as a symptom in
other categories of psychiatric disturbance.

Affect—An observed emotional expression or
response. In some situations, anxiety would be
considered an inappropriate affect.
Anxiolytic—A type of medication that helps to
relieve anxiety.
Autonomic nervous system (ANS)—The part of the
nervous system that supplies nerve endings in the
blood vessels, heart, intestines, glands, and smooth
muscles, and governs their involuntary functioning.
The autonomic nervous system is responsible for
the biochemical changes involved in experiences
of anxiety.
Endocrine gland—A ductless gland, such as the
pituitary, thyroid, or adrenal gland, that secretes
its products directly into the blood or lymph.
Free-floating anxiety—Anxiety that lacks a definite
focus or content.
Hyperarousal—A state or condition of muscular
and emotional tension produced by hormones
released during the fight-or-flight reaction.
Hypothalamus—A portion of the brain that regulates the autonomic nervous system, the release of
hormones from the pituitary gland, sleep cycles,
and body temperature.
Limbic system—A group of structures in the brain
that includes the hypothalamus, amygdala, and
hippocampus. The limbic system plays an important part in regulation of human moods and emotions. Many psychiatric disorders are related to
malfunctioning of the limbic system.
Phobia—In psychoanalytic theory, a psychological
defense against anxiety in which the patient displaces anxious feelings onto an external object,
activity, or situation.

Description
Although anxiety is a commonplace experience
that everyone has from time to time, it is difficult to
describe concretely because it has so many different
potential causes and degrees of intensity. Doctors
sometimes categorize anxiety as an emotion or an
affect depending on whether it is being described by
the person having it (emotion) or by an outside observer (affect). The word emotion is generally used for the
biochemical changes and feeling state that underlie a
person’s internal sense of anxiety. Affect is used to
describe the person’s emotional state from an observer’s perspective. If a doctor says that a patient has an
anxious affect, he or she means that the patient
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

appears nervous or anxious, or responds to others in
an anxious way (for example, the individual is shaky,
tremulous, etc.).
Although anxiety is related to fear, it is not the
same thing. Fear is a direct, focused response to a
specific event or object, and the person is consciously
aware of it. Most people will feel fear if someone
points a loaded gun at them or if they see a tornado
forming on the horizon. They also will recognize that
they are afraid. Anxiety, on the other hand, is often
unfocused, vague, and hard to pin down to a specific
cause. In this form it is called free-floating anxiety.
357

Anxiety

Sometimes anxiety being experienced in the present
may stem from an event or person that produced
pain and fear in the past, but the anxious individual
is not consciously aware of the original source of the
feeling. It is anxiety’s aspect of remoteness that makes
it hard for people to compare their experiences of it.
Whereas most people will be fearful in physically dangerous situations, and can agree that fear is an appropriate response in the presence of danger, anxiety is
often triggered by objects or events that are unique
and specific to an individual. An individual might be
anxious because of a unique meaning or memory
being stimulated by present circumstances, not
because of some immediate danger. Another individual looking at the anxious person from the outside
may be truly puzzled as to the reason for the person’s
anxiety.

Causes and symptoms
Anxiety can have a number of different causes. It is
a multidimensional response to stimuli in the person’s
environment, or a response to an internal stimulus (for
example, a hypochondriac’s reaction to a stomach
rumbling) resulting from a combination of general
biological and individual psychological processes.
Physical
In some cases, anxiety is produced by physical
responses to stress, or by certain disease processes or
medications.
THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (ANS). The nervous system of human beings is ‘‘hard-wired’’ to
respond to dangers or threats. These responses are
not subject to conscious control, and are the same in
humans as in lower animals. They represent an evolutionary adaptation to the animal predators and other
dangers with which all animals, including primitive
humans, had to cope. The most familiar reaction of
this type is the so-called ‘‘fight-or-flight’’ response.
This response is the human organism’s automatic
‘‘red alert’’ in a life-threatening situation. It is a state
of physiological and emotional hyperarousal marked
by high muscle tension and strong feelings of fear or
anger. When a person has a fight-or-flight reaction,
the level of stress hormones in their blood rises. They
become more alert and attentive, their eyes dilate, their
heartbeat increases, their breathing rate increases, and
their digestion slows down, allowing more energy to be
available to the muscles.

This emergency reaction is regulated by a part
of the nervous system called the autonomic nervous
system, or ANS. The ANS is controlled by the
358

hypothalamus, a specialized part of the brainstem
that is among a group of structures called the limbic
system. The limbic system controls human emotions
through its connections to glands and muscles; it also
connects to the ANS and ‘‘higher’’ brain centers, such
as parts of the cerebral cortex. One problem with this
arrangement is that the limbic system cannot tell the
difference between a realistic physical threat and an
anxiety-producing thought or idea. The hypothalamus
may trigger the release of stress hormones by the
pituitary gland, even when there is no external and
objective danger. A second problem is caused by the
biochemical side effects of too many ‘‘false alarms’’ in
the ANS. When a person responds to a real danger,
his or her body gets rid of the stress hormones by
running away or by fighting. In modern life, however,
people often have fight-or-flight reactions in situations
in which they can neither run away nor lash out
physically. As a result, their bodies have to absorb all
the biochemical changes of hyperarousal, rather
than release them. These biochemical changes can
produce anxious feelings, as well as muscle tension
and other physical symptoms associated with anxiety.
They may even produce permanent changes in the
brain, if the process occurs repeatedly. Moreover,
chronic physical disorders, such as coronary artery
disease, may be worsened by anxiety, as chronic
hyperarousal puts undue stress on the heart, stomach,
and other organs.
DISEASES AND DISORDERS. Anxiety can be a symptom of certain medical conditions. Some of these diseases are disorders of the endocrine system, such as
Cushing’s syndrome (overproduction of cortisol by
the adrenal cortex), and include over- or underactivity
of the thyroid gland. Other medical conditions that
can produce anxiety include respiratory distress syndrome, mitral valve prolapse, porphyria, and chest
pain caused by inadequate blood supply to the heart
(angina pectoris).

A study released in 2004 showed that people who
had experienced traumatic bone injuries may have
unrecognized anxiety in the form of post-traumatic
stress disorder. This disorder can result from witnessing or experiencing an event involving serious injury,
or threatened death (or experiencing the death or
threatened death of another.)
MEDICATIONS AND SUBSTANCE USE. Numerous
medications may cause anxiety-like symptoms as a
side effect. They include birth control pills; some thyroid or asthma drugs; some psychotropic agents;
occasionally, local anesthetics; corticosteroids; antihypertensive drugs; and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (like flurbiprofen and ibuprofen).

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Withdrawal from certain prescription drugs,
primarily beta blockers and corticosteroids, can
cause anxiety. Withdrawal from drugs of abuse,
including LSD, cocaine, alcohol, and opiates, can
also cause anxiety.
Learned associations
Some aspects of anxiety appear to be unavoidable
byproducts of the human developmental process.
Humans are unique among animals in that they
spend an unusually long period of early life in a relatively helpless condition, and a sense of helplessness
can lead to anxiety. The extended period of human
dependency on adults means that people may remember, and learn to anticipate, frightening or upsetting
experiences long before they are capable enough to feel
a sense of mastery over their environment. In addition,
the fact that anxiety disorders often run in families
indicates that children can learn unhealthy attitudes
and behaviors from parents, as well as healthy ones.
Also, recurrent disorders in families may indicate that
there is a genetic or inherited component in some
anxiety disorders. For example, there has been found
to be a higher rate of anxiety disorders (panic) in
identical twins than in fraternal twins.
CHILDHOOD

DEVELOPMENT

AND

ANXIETY.

Researchers in early childhood development regard
anxiety in adult life as a residue of childhood memories of dependency. Humans learn during the first
year of life that they are not self-sufficient and that
their basic survival depends on the care of others. It is
thought that this early experience of helplessness
underlies the most common anxieties of adult life,
including fear of powerlessness and fear of being
unloved. Thus, adults can be made anxious by symbolic threats to their sense of competence and/or
significant relationships, even though they are no
longer helpless children.
SYMBOLIZATION. The psychoanalytic model gives
considerable weight to the symbolic aspect of human
anxiety; examples include phobic disorders, obsessions,
compulsions, and other forms of anxiety that are highly
individualized. The length of the human maturation
process allows many opportunities for children and
adolescents to connect their experiences with certain

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

objects or events that can bring back feelings in later
life. For example, a person who was frightened as a child
by a tall man wearing glasses may feel panicky years
later by something that reminds him of that person or
experience without consciously knowing why.
Freud thought that anxiety results from a person’s internal conflicts. According to his theory,
people feel anxious when they feel torn between
desires or urges toward certain actions, on the one
hand, and moral restrictions, on the other. In some
cases, the person’s anxiety may attach itself to an
object that represents the inner conflict. For example, someone who feels anxious around money may
be pulled between a desire to steal and the belief that
stealing is wrong. Money becomes a symbol for the
inner conflict between doing what is considered right
and doing what one wants.
PHOBIAS. Phobias are a special type of anxiety
reaction in which the person’s anxiety is concentrated
on a specific object or situation that the person then
tries to avoid. In most cases, the person’s fear is out of
all proportion to its ‘‘cause.’’ Prior to the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition
(DSM-IV), these specific phobias were called simple
phobias. It is estimated that 10-11% of the population
will develop a phobia in the course of their lives. Some
phobias, such as agoraphobia (fear of open spaces),
claustrophobia (fear of small or confined spaces), and
social phobia, are shared by large numbers of people.
Others are less common or unique to the patient.

Social and environmental stressors
Anxiety often has a social dimension because
humans are social creatures. People frequently report
feelings of high anxiety when they anticipate and,
therefore, fear the loss of social approval or love.
Social phobia is a specific anxiety disorder that is
marked by high levels of anxiety or fear of embarrassment in social situations.
Another social stressor is prejudice. People who
belong to groups that are targets of bias are at higher
risk for developing anxiety disorders. Some experts
think, for example, that the higher rates of phobias
and panic disorder among women reflects their greater
social and economic vulnerability.
Some controversial studies indicate that the
increase in violent or upsetting pictures and stories in
news reports and entertainment may raise the anxiety
level of many people. Stress and anxiety management
programs often suggest that patients cut down their
exposure to upsetting stimuli.
359

Anxiety

Although people do not usually think of caffeine as
a drug, it can cause anxiety-like symptoms when consumed in sufficient quantity. Patients who consume caffeine rich foods and beverages, such as chocolate, cocoa,
coffee, tea, or carbonated soft drinks (especially cola
beverages), can sometimes lower their anxiety symptoms
simply by reducing their intake of these substances.

Anxiety

Anxiety may also be caused by environmental or
occupational factors. People who must live or work
around sudden or loud noises, bright or flashing lights,
chemical vapors, or similar nuisances, which they cannot
avoid or control, may develop heightened anxiety levels.
Existential anxiety
Another factor that shapes human experiences of
anxiety is knowledge of personal mortality. Humans are
the only animals that appear to be aware of their limited
life span. Some researchers think that awareness of
death influences experiences of anxiety from the time
that a person is old enough to understand death.
Symptoms of anxiety
In order to understand the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of its symptoms.
SOMATIC. The somatic or physical symptoms of

anxiety include headaches, dizziness or lightheadedness, nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhea, tingling, pale
complexion, sweating, numbness, difficulty in breathing, and sensations of tightness in the chest, neck,
shoulders, or hands. These symptoms are produced
by the hormonal, muscular, and cardiovascular reactions involved in the fight-or-flight reaction. Children
and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder show
a high percentage of physical complaints.
BEHAVIORAL. Behavioral symptoms of anxiety
include pacing, trembling, general restlessness, hyperventilation, pressured speech, hand wringing, or finger
tapping.
COGNITIVE. Cognitive symptoms of anxiety
include recurrent or obsessive thoughts, feelings of
doom, morbid or fear-inducing thoughts or ideas,
and confusion, or inability to concentrate.
EMOTIONAL. Feeling states associated with anxiety include tension or nervousness, feeling ‘‘hyper’’ or
‘‘keyed up,’’ and feelings of unreality, panic, or terror.
DEFENSE MECHANISMS. In psychoanalytic theory,
the symptoms of anxiety in humans may arise from or
activate a number of unconscious defense mechanisms. Because of these defenses, it is possible for a
person to be anxious without being consciously
aware of it or appearing anxious to others. These
psychological defenses include:


Repression. The person pushes anxious thoughts or
ideas out of conscious awareness.



Displacement. Anxiety from one source is attached
to a different object or event. Phobias are an example

360

of the mechanism of displacement in psychoanalytic
theory.


Rationalization. The person justifies the anxious
feelings by saying that any normal person would
feel anxious in their situation.



Somatization. The anxiety emerges in the form of
physical complaints and illnesses, such as recurrent
headaches, stomach upsets, or muscle and joint pain.



Delusion formation. The person converts anxious
feelings into conspiracy theories or similar ideas
without reality testing. Delusion formation can
involve groups as well as individuals.

Other theorists attribute some drug addiction to the
desire to relieve symptoms of anxiety. Most addictions,
they argue, originate in the use of mood-altering substances or behaviors to ‘‘medicate’’ anxious feelings.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of anxiety is difficult and complex
because of the variety of its causes and the highly
personalized and individualized nature of its symptom
formation. There are no medical tests that can be used
to diagnose anxiety by itself. When a doctor examines
an anxious patient, he or she will first rule out physical
conditions and diseases that have anxiety as a symptom. Apart from these exclusions, the physical examination is usually inconclusive. Some anxious patients
may have their blood pressure or pulse rate affected by
anxiety, or may look pale or perspire heavily, but
others may appear physically completely normal.
The doctor will then take the patient’s medication,
dietary, and occupational history to see if they are
taking prescription drugs that might cause anxiety, if
they are abusing alcohol or mood-altering drugs,
if they are consuming large amounts of caffeine, or if
their workplace is noisy or dangerous. In most cases,
the most important source of diagnostic information is
the patient’s psychological and social history. The
doctor may administer a brief psychological test to
help evaluate the intensity of the patient’s anxiety and
some of its features. Some tests that are often given
include the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the Anxiety
Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS). Many doctors
will check a number of chemical factors in the blood,
such as the level of thyroid hormone and blood sugar.

Treatment
Not all patients with anxiety require treatment,
but for more severe cases, treatment is recommended.
Because anxiety often has more than one cause and is
experienced in highly individual ways, its treatment
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Medications
Medications are often prescribed to relieve the
physical and psychological symptoms of anxiety.
Most agents work by counteracting the biochemical
and muscular changes involved in the fight-or-flight
reaction. Some work directly on the chemicals in the
brain that are thought to underlie the anxiety.
ANXIOLYTICS. Anxiolytics are sometimes called
tranquilizers. Most anxiolytic drugs are either benzodiazepines or barbiturates. Barbiturates, once commonly used, are now rarely used in clinical practice.
Barbiturates work by slowing down the transmission
of nerve impulses from the brain to other parts
of the body. They include such drugs as phenobarbital
(Luminal) and pentobarbital (Nembutal). Benzodiazepines work by relaxing the skeletal muscles and
calming the limbic system. They include such drugs
as chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and diazepam
(Valium). Both barbiturates and benzodiazepines are
potentially habit-forming and may cause withdrawal
symptoms, but benzodiazepines are far less likely than
barbiturates to cause physical dependency. Both drugs
also increase the effects of alcohol and should never be
taken in combination with it.

Two other types of anxiolytic medications
include meprobamate (Equanil), which is now
rarely used, and buspirone (BuSpar), a new type
of anxiolytic that appears to work by increasing
the efficiency of the body’s own emotion-regulating
brain chemicals. Buspirone has several advantages
over other anxiolytics. It does not cause dependence problems, does not interact with alcohol,
and does not affect the patient’s ability to drive
or operate machinery. However, buspirone is not
effective against certain types of anxiety, such as
panic disorder.
ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND BETA-BLOCKERS. For some
anxiety disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic type anxiety, a type of drugs used to treat
depression, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs; such as Prozac and Paxil), are the treatment
of choice. A newer drug that has been shown as effective as Paxil is called escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro).
Because anxiety often coexists with symptoms of

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

depression, many doctors prescribe antidepressant
medications for anxious/depressed patients. While
SSRIs are more common, antidepressants are sometimes prescribed, including tricyclic antidepressants
such as imipramine (Tofranil) or monoamine oxidase
inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) such as phenelzine
(Nardil).
Beta-blockers are medications that work by
blocking the body’s reaction to the stress hormones
that are released during the fight-or-flight reaction.
They include drugs like propranolol (Inderal) or atenolol (Tenormin). Beta-blockers are sometimes given
to patients with post-traumatic anxiety symptoms.
More commonly, the beta-blockers are given to
patients with a mild form of social phobic anxiety,
such as fear of public speaking.
Psychotherapy
Most patients with anxiety will be given some
form of psychotherapy along with medications.
Many patients benefit from insight-oriented therapies,
which are designed to help them uncover unconscious
conflicts and defense mechanisms in order to understand how their symptoms developed. Patients who
are extremely anxious may benefit from supportive
psychotherapy, which aims at symptom reduction
rather than personality restructuring.
Two newer approaches that work well with
anxious patients are cognitive-behavioral therapy
(CBT), and relaxation training. In CBT, the patient
is taught to identify the thoughts and situations that
stimulate his or her anxiety, and to view them more
realistically. In the behavioral part of the program, the
patient is exposed to the anxiety-provoking object,
situation, or internal stimulus (like a rapid heart
beat) in gradual stages until he or she is desensitized
to it. Relaxation training, which is sometimes called
anxiety management training, includes breathing exercises and similar techniques intended to help the
patient prevent hyperventilation and relieve the muscle tension associated with the fight-or-flight reaction.
Both CBT and relaxation training can be used in
group therapy as well as individual treatment. In addition to CBT, support groups are often helpful to
anxious patients, because they provide a social network and lessen the embarrassment that often accompanies anxiety symptoms.
Psychosurgery
Surgery on the brain is very rarely recommended
for patients with anxiety; however, some patients with
severe cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
361

Anxiety

usually requires more than one type of therapy. In
addition, there is no way to tell in advance how
patients will respond to a specific drug or therapy.
Sometimes the doctor will need to try different medications or methods of treatment before finding the
best combination for the particular patient. It usually
takes about six to eight weeks for the doctor to evaluate the effectiveness of a treatment regimen.

have been helped by an operation on a part of
the brain that is involved in OCD. Normally, this
operation is attempted after all other treatments have
failed.

Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for anxiety cover a variety
of approaches. Meditation and mindfulness training
are thought beneficial to patients with phobias and
panic disorder. Hydrotherapy is useful to some
anxious patients because it promotes general relaxation of the nervous system. Yoga, aikido, t’ai chi, and
dance therapy help patients work with the physical, as
well as the emotional, tensions that either promote
anxiety or are created by the anxiety.
Homeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine
approach anxiety as a symptom of a systemic disorder.
Homeopathic practitioners select a remedy based on
other associated symptoms and the patient’s general
constitution. Chinese medicine regards anxiety as a
blockage of qi, or vital force, inside the patient’s
body that is most likely to affect the lung and large
intestine meridian flow. The practitioner of Chinese
medicine chooses acupuncture point locations and/or
herbal therapy to move the qi and rebalance the entire
system in relation to the lung and large intestine.

Prognosis
The prognosis for resolution of anxiety depends
on the specific disorder and a wide variety of factors,
including the patient’s age, sex, general health, living
situation, belief system, social support network, and
responses to different anxiolytic medications and
forms of therapy.

Prevention
Humans have significant control over thoughts,
and, therefore, may learn ways of preventing anxiety
by changing irrational ideas and beliefs. Humans
also have some power over anxiety arising from
social and environmental conditions. Other forms
of anxiety, however, are built into the human organism and its life cycle, and cannot be prevented or
eliminated.

I Anxiety disorders
Definition
The anxiety disorders are a group of mental disturbances characterized by anxiety as a central or core
symptom. Although anxiety is a commonplace experience, not everyone who experiences it has an anxiety
disorder. Anxiety is associated with a wide range of
physical illnesses, medication side effects, and other
psychiatric disorders.
The revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) that took place
after 1980 brought major changes in the classification
of the anxiety disorders. Prior to 1980, psychiatrists
classified patients on the basis of a theory that defined
anxiety as the outcome of unconscious conflicts in the
patient’s mind. DSM-III (1980), DSM-III-R (1987),
and DSM-IV (1994) introduced and refined a new
classification that considered recent discoveries
about the biochemical and post-traumatic origins
of some types of anxiety. The present definitions
are based on the external and reported symptom
patterns of the disorders rather than on theories
about their origins.

Description
Anxiety disorders are the most common form of
mental disturbance in the United States population. It is
estimated that 28 million people suffer from an anxiety
disorder every year. These disorders are a serious problem for the entire society because of their interference
with patients’ work, schooling, and family life. They
also contribute to the high rates of alcohol and substance abuse in the United States. Anxiety disorders
are an additional problem for health professionals
because the physical symptoms of anxiety frequently
bring people to primary care doctors or emergency
rooms.
DSM-IV defines 12 types of anxiety disorders in
the adult population. They can be grouped under
seven headings:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



Panic disorders with or without agoraphobia. The
chief characteristic of panic disorder is the occurrence
of panic attacks coupled with fear of their recurrence.
In clinical settings, agoraphobia is usually not a disorder byitself, but is typically associated with some
form of panic disorder. Patients with agoraphobia
are afraid of places or situations in which they might
have a panic attack and be unable to leave or to find
help. About 25% of patients with panic disorder
develop obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Phobias. These include specific phobias and social
phobia. A phobia is an intense irrational fear of a
specific object or situation that compels the patient
to avoid it. Some phobias concern activities or
objects that involve some risk (for example, flying
or driving) but many are focused on harmless animals or other objects. Social phobia involves a fear of
being humiliated, judged, or scrutinized. It manifests
itself as a fear of performing certain functions in the
presence of others, such as public speaking or using
public lavatories.

KEY TERMS
Agoraphobia—Abnormal anxiety regarding public
places or situations from which the patient may
wish to flee or in which he or she would be helpless
in the event of a panic attack.
Compulsion—A repetitive or ritualistic behavior
that a person performs to reduce anxiety.
Compulsions often develop as a way of controlling
or ‘‘undoing’’ obsessive thoughts.
Obsession—A repetitive or persistent thought,
idea, or impulse that is perceived as inappropriate
and distressing.
Panic attack—A time-limited period of intense fear
accompanied by physical and cognitive symptoms.
Panic attacks may be unexpected or triggered by
specific cues.



Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This disorder
is marked by unwanted, intrusive, persistent
thoughts or repetitive behaviors that reflect the
patient’s anxiety or attempts to control it. It affects
between 2-3% of the population and is much more
common than was previously thought.

medical conditions or substance abuse are less ageand gender-specific. Whereas OCD affects males and
females equally, GAD, panic disorder, and specific
phobias all affect women more frequently than men.
GAD and panic disorders are more likely to develop in
young adults, while phobias and OCD can begin in
childhood.



Stress disorders. These include post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder. Stress
disorders are symptomatic reactions to traumatic
events in the patient’s life.

Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents



Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is the
most commonly diagnosed anxiety disorder and
occurs most frequently in young adults.



Anxiety disorders due to known physical causes.
These include general medical conditions or substance abuse.



Anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. This last
category is not a separate type of disorder, but is
included to cover symptoms that do not meet the
specific DSM-IV criteria for other anxiety disorders.

All DSM-IV anxiety disorder diagnoses include a
criterion of severity. The anxiety must be severe
enough to interfere significantly with the patient’s
occupational or educational functioning, social activities or close relationships, and other customary
activities.
The anxiety disorders vary widely in their frequency of occurrence in the general population, age
of onset, family patterns, and gender distribution. The
stress disorders and anxiety disorders caused by
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

DSM-IV defines one anxiety disorder as specific
to children, namely, separation anxiety disorder. This
disorder is defined as anxiety regarding separation
from home or family that is excessive or inappropriate
for the child’s age. In some children, separation anxiety takes the form of school avoidance.
Children and adolescents can also be diagnosed
with panic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder, and the post-traumatic stress syndromes.

Causes and symptoms
The causes of anxiety include a variety of individual and general social factors, and may produce physical, cognitive, emotional, or behavioral symptoms.
The patient’s ethnic or cultural background may also
influence his or her vulnerability to certain forms of
anxiety. Genetic factors that lead to biochemical
abnormalities may also play a role.
Anxiety in children may be caused by suffering
from abuse, as well as by the factors that cause anxiety
in adults.

Anxiety disorders

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of anxiety disorders is complicated by
the variety of causes of anxiety and the range of disorders that may include anxiety as a symptom. Many
patients who suffer from anxiety disorders have features
or symptoms of more than one disorder. Patients whose
anxiety is accounted for by another psychic disorder,
such as schizophrenia or major depression, are not
diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. A doctor examining
an anxious patient will usually begin by ruling out diseases that are known to cause anxiety and then proceed
to take the patient’s medication history, in order to
exclude side effects of prescription drugs. Most doctors
will ask about caffeine consumption to see if the
patient’s dietary habits are a factor. The patient’s work
and family situation will also be discussed. Often, primary care physicians will exhaust resources looking for
medical causes for general patient complaints which
may indicate a physical illness. In 2004, the Anxiety
Disorders Association of American published guidelines to better aid physicians in diagnosing and managing generalized anxiety disorder. Laboratory tests for
blood sugar and thyroid function are also common.
Diagnostic testing for anxiety
There are no laboratory tests that can diagnose
anxiety, although the doctor may order some specific
tests to rule out disease conditions. Although there is
no psychiatric test that can provide definite diagnoses
of anxiety disorders, there are several short-answer
interviews or symptom inventories that doctors can
use to evaluate the intensity of a patient’s anxiety
and some of its associated features. These measures
include the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the Anxiety
Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS).

Treatment
For relatively mild anxiety disorders, psychotherapy alone may suffice. In general, doctors prefer to use
a combination of medications and psychotherapy with
more severely anxious patients. Most patients respond
better to a combination of treatment methods than to
either medications or psychotherapy in isolation.
Because of the variety of medications and treatment
approaches that are used to treat anxiety disorders, the
doctor cannot predict in advance which combination
will be most helpful to a specific patient. In many cases
the doctor will need to try a new medication or treatment over a six- to eight-week period in order to assess
its effectiveness. Treatment trials do not necessarily
mean that the patient cannot be helped or that the
doctor is incompetent.
364

Although anxiety disorders are not always easy to
diagnose, there are several reasons why it is important
for patients with severe anxiety symptoms to get help.
Anxiety doesn’t always go away by itself; it often
progresses to panic attacks, phobias, and episodes of
depression. Untreated anxiety disorders may eventually lead to a diagnosis of major depression, or
interfere with the patient’s education or ability to
keep a job. In addition, many anxious patients develop
addictions to drugs or alcohol when they try to ‘‘medicate’’ their symptoms. Moreover, since children learn
ways of coping with anxiety from their parents, adults
who get help for anxiety disorders are in a better
position to help their families cope with factors that
lead to anxiety than those who remain untreated.

Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for anxiety cover a variety
of approaches. Meditation and mindfulness training
are thought beneficial to patients with phobias and
panic disorder. Hydrotherapy is useful to some
anxious patients because it promotes general relaxation of the nervous system. Yoga, aikido, t’ai chi, and
dance therapy help patients work with the physical, as
well as the emotional, tensions that either promote
anxiety or are created by the anxiety.
Homeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine
approach anxiety as a symptom of a systemic disorder.
Homeopathic practitioners select a remedy based on
other associated symptoms and the patient’s general
constitution. Chinese medicine regards anxiety as a
blockage of qi, or vital force, inside the patient’s
body that is most likely to affect the lung and large
intestine meridian flow. The practitioner of Chinese
medicine chooses acupuncture point locations and/or
herbal therapy to move the qi and rebalance the entire
system in relation to the lung and large intestine.

Prognosis
The prognosis for recovery depends on the specific disorder, the severity of the patient’s symptoms, the
specific causes of the anxiety, and the patient’s degree
of control over these causes.

Prevention
Anxiety is an unavoidable feature of human existence. However, humans have some power over their
reactions to anxiety-provoking events and situations.
Cognitive therapy and meditation or mindfulness
training appear to be beneficial in helping people
lower their long-term anxiety levels.

I Aortic aneurysm
Definition

Surgery being performed to correct aortic aneurysm. (Custom
Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)

An aneurysm is an abnormal bulging or swelling
of a portion of a blood vessel. The aorta, which can
develop these abnormal bulges, is the large blood
vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood away from the
heart to the rest of the body.

Description
The aorta carries oxygen-rich blood to the body,
and is therefore called an artery. Because the aorta is an
artery, its walls are made of up three layers; a thin inner
layer, a muscular middle layer (that gives the vessel its
flexibility under pressure from the filling blood), and a
fiber-like outer layer that gives the vessel strength to not
burst when the heart pumps blood to the body.
Aortic aneurysms occur when a weakness develops in part of the wall of the aorta; three basic
types are usually found. If all three layers of the
vessel are affected and weakness develops along an
extended area of the vessel, the weakened area will
appear as a large, bulging region of blood vessel;
this is called a fusiform aneurysm. If weakness
develops between the inner and outer layers of the
aortic wall, a bulge results as blood from the interior of the vessel is pushed around the damaged
region in the wall and collects between these layers.
This is called a dissecting aneurysm because one
layer is ‘‘dissected’’ or separated from another. If
damage occurs to only the middle (muscular) layer
of the vessel, a sack-like bulge can form; therefore,
this is a saccular aneurysm.

Causes and symptoms
Aortic aneurysms occur in different portions of
the aorta, which begins in the chest (at the heart) and
travels downward through the abdomen. Aneurysms
found in the region of the aorta within the chest are

called thoracic aortic aneurysms. Aneurysms that
occur in the part of the aorta within the abdomen are
called abdominal aortic aneurysms.
Thoracic aortic aneurysms do not usually produce any noticeable symptoms. However, as the
aneurysm becomes larger, chest, shoulder, neck,
lower back, or abdominal pain can result.
Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur more often in
men, and these aneurysms can cause pain in the
lower back, hips, and abdomen. A painful abdominal aortic aneurysm usually means that the aneurysm
could burst very soon.
Most abdominal aortic aneurysms are caused by
atherosclerosis, a condition caused when fat (mostly
cholesterol) carried in the blood builds up in the inner
wall of the aorta. As more and more fat attaches to the
aortic wall, the wall itself becomes abnormally weak
and often results in an aneurysm or bulge.

Aortic aneurysms occur when a weakness develops in a part of the wall of the aorta. The aorta is the large blood vessel that

Diagnosis

KEY TERMS
Atherosclerosis—The accumulation of fat on the
inner wall of an artery. This fat is largely made up
of cholesterol being carried in the blood.
Dacron—A synthetic polyester fiber used to surgically repair damaged sections of blood vessel walls.

Silent, stable aneurysms are often detected when a
person has an x ray as part of a routine examination or
for other medical reasons. Otherwise, when chest,
abdominal, or back pain is severe, aortic aneurysm is
suspected and x-ray (radiographic) studies can confirm or rule out that condition.

Treatment
Aortic aneurysms are also caused by a breakdown
of the muscular middle layer of the artery wall, by high
blood pressure, by direct injury to the chest, and
although rare, by bacteria that can infect the aorta.
366

Aortic aneurysms are potentially life-threatening
conditions. Small aneurysms should be monitored for
their rate of growth and large aneurysms require consideration for a surgical repair. The most common
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS
Dissection—A cut or divide.
Hemorrhage—A large discharge of blood, profuse
bleeding.

Prognosis
Only 1-2% of people die from having surgical
repair of an aortic aneurysm. However, if the aneurysm
is untreated and eventually ruptures, less than half of
the people with ruptured aneurysms will survive. The
challenge for the physician is to decide when or if to do
the preventive surgery.

Prevention
Aneuryms can develop in people with atherosclerosis. High blood pressure can also lead to this
condition. Although no definite prevention exists, lifestyle and dietary changes that help lower blood pressure and the amount of fat in the blood stream may
slow the development of aneurysms.

pressure. When a defect develops, blood pressure can
force the tear to open and allow blood to pass through.
Since the blood is under pressure, it eventually splits
(dissecting) the middle layer of the blood vessel, creating a new channel for blood. The length of the channel
grows over time and can result in the closing off of
connection points to other arteries. This can lead to
heart attack, strokes, abdominal pain, and nerve
damage. Blood may leak from the dissection and collect in the chest an around the heart.
A second mechanism leading to aortic dissection
is medial hemorrhage. A medial hemorrhage occurs in
the middle layer of the blood vessel and spills through
the inner lining of the aorta wall. This opening then
allows blood from the aorta to enter the vessel wall
and begin a dissection. Approximately 2,000 cases of
aortic dissection occur yearly in the United States.

I Aortic dissection
Definition
Aortic dissection is a rare, but potentially fatal,
condition in which blood passes through the inner
lining and between the layers of the aorta. The dissecting aorta usually does not burst, but has an abnormal
second channel within it.

Description
A defect in the inner lining of the aorta allows an
opening or tear to develop. The aorta is the main
artery of the body and is an area of high blood
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Causes and symptoms
Aortic dissection is caused by a deterioration of
the inner lining of the aorta. There are a number of
conditions that predispose a person to develop defects
of the inner lining, including high blood pressure,
Marfan’s disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, connective
tissue diseases, and defects of heart development
which begin during fetal development. A dissection
can also occur accidentally following insertion of a
catheter, trauma, or surgery. The main symptom is sudden, intense pain. The pain can be so intense as to
immobilize the patient and cause him to fall to the
ground. The pain is frequently felt in both the chest
and in the back, between the shoulder blades. The extent
of the pain is proportional to the length of the dissection.

Diagnosis
The pain experienced by the patient is the first
symptom of aortic dissection and is unique. The pain is
usually described by the patient as ‘‘tearing, ripping, or
stabbing.’’ This is in contrast to the pain associated with
heart attacks. The patient frequently has a reduced or
absent pulse in the extremities. A murmur may be heard
if the dissection is close to the heart. An enlarged aorta
will usually appear in the chest x rays and ultrasound

exams of most patients. The use of a blood dye in angiograms and/or CT scans (computed tomography scans)
will aid in diagnosing and visualizing the dissection.

Treatment
Because of the potentially fatal nature of aortic
dissection, patients are treated immediately. Drugs are
administered to reduce the blood pressure and heart
rate. If the dissection is small, drug therapy alone may
be used. In other cases, surgery is performed. In surgery, damaged sections of the aorta are removed and a
synthetic graft is often used to reconstruct the
damaged vessel.

Prognosis
Depending on the nature and extent of the dissection, death can occur within a few hours of the start of
a dissection. Approximately 75% of untreated people
die within two weeks of the start of a dissection. Of
those who are treated, 40% survive more than 10
years. Patients are usually given long term treatment
with drugs to reduce their blood pressure, even if they
have had surgery.

Aortic incompetence see Aortic valve
insufficiency
Aortic regurgitation see Aortic valve
insufficiency
Aortic stenosis see Aortic valve stenosis

Description
Aortic valve insufficiency occurs when this
valve cannot properly close after blood that is leaving the heart’s left ventricle enters the aorta. With
each contraction of the heart more and more blood
flows back into the left ventricle, causing the ventricle to become overfilled. This larger-than-normal
amount of blood that collects in the left ventricle
puts pressure on the walls of the heart, causing the
heart muscle to increase in thickness (hypertrophy).
If this thickening continues, the heart can be permanently damaged.
Aortic valve insufficiency is also know as aortic valve
regurgitation because of the abnormal reversed flow of
blood leaking through the poorly functioning valve.

I Aortic valve insufficiency
Definition
The aortic valve separates the left ventricle of the
heart (the heart’s largest pumping chamber) from the
aorta, the large artery that carries oxygen-rich blood out
of the left ventricle to the rest of the body. In aortic valve
insufficiency, the aortic valve becomes leaky, causing
blood to flow backwards into the left ventricle.
368

Causes and symptoms
The faulty working of the aortic valve can be
caused by a birth defect; by abnormal widening
of the aorta (which can be caused by very high blood
pressure and a variety of other less common conditions); by various diseases that cause large amounts of
swelling (inflammation) in different areas of the body,
like rheumatic fever; and, although rarely, by the sexually transmitted disease, syphilis.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Rheumatic fever—A disease believed to be caused
by a bacterium named group A streptococcus. This
bacterium causes a sore ‘‘strep throat’’ and can also
result in fever. Infection by this bacterium can also
damage the heart and its valves, but how this takes
place is not clearly understood.

Although drug treatment can help put off the need
for surgical valve replacement, it is important to
replace the faulty valve before the heart muscle itself
is damaged beyond recovery.

About 75% of people with aortic valve insufficiency are men. Rheumatic (inflammatory) diseases
have been the main cause of this condition in both
men and women.
Aortic valve insufficiency can remain unnoticed
for 10 to 15 years. In cases of severe insufficiency a
person may notice a variety of symptoms, including an
uncomfortable pounding of the heart when lying
down, a very rapid or hard heart beat (palpitations),
shortness of breath, chest pain, and if untreated for
very long times, swelling of the liver, ankles, and belly.

Diagnosis
A poorly functioning or insufficient aortic valve
can be identified when a doctor listens to the heart
during a physical examination. A chest x ray, an electrocardiogram (ECG, an electrical printout of the heart
beats), as well as an echocardiogram (a test that uses
sound waves to create an image of the heart and its
valves), can further evaluate or confirm the condition.

Treatment
Aortic insufficiency is usually corrected by having
the defective valve surgically replaced. However, such
an operation is done in severe cases. Before the condition worsens, certain drugs can be used to help manage
this condition.
Drugs that remove water from the body, drugs
that lower blood pressure, and drugs that help the
heart beat more effectively can each be used for this
condition. Reducing the amount of salt in the diet also
helps lower the amount of fluid the body holds and can
help the heart to work more efficiently as well.
In cases of a severely malfunctioning valve that
has been untreated for a long time, surgery is the
treatment of choice, especially if the heart is not functioning normally. Human heart valves can be replaced
with man-made valves or with valves taken from pig
hearts.

I Aortic valve stenosis
Definition
When aortic valve stenosis occurs, the aortic
valve, located between the aorta and left ventricle of
the heart, is narrower than normal size.

Description
A normal aortic valve, when open, allows the free
flow of blood from the left ventricle to the aorta. When
the valve narrows, as it does with stenosis, blood flow
is impeded. Because it is more difficult for blood
to flow through the valve, there is increased strain on
the heart. This can cause the left ventricle to enlarge
and malfunction, resulting in reduced blood supply to
the heart muscle and body, as well as fluid build up in
the lungs.

Cause and symptoms
Aortic valve stenosis can occur because of a birth
defect in the formation of the valve. Calcium deposits
may form on the valve with aging, causing the valve to
become stiff and narrow. Stenosis can also occur as a
result of rheumatic fever. Mild aortic stenosis may
produce no symptoms at all. The most common symptoms, depending on the severity of the disease, are
chest pain, blackouts, and difficulty breathing.

KEY TERMS

moves blood from the left ventricle to the rest of
the body.
ECG—Also called an electrocardiogram, it records
the electrical activity of the heart.
Echocardiogram—A procedure in which high frequency sound waves harmlessly bounce off organs
in the body providing an image so one can determine their structure and function.

(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)

Diagnosis
Using a stethoscope, a physician may hear a murmur and other abnormal heart sounds. An ECG, also
called an electrocardiogram, records the electrical
activity of the heart. This technique and chest x ray
can show evidence that the left ventricle is enlarged.
An x ray can also reveal calcium deposits on the valve,
as well as congestion in the lungs. Echocardiography
can pick up thickening of the valve, heart size, and
whether or not the valve is working properly. This is
a procedure in which high frequency sound waves
harmlessly bounce off organs in the body. Cardiac
catheterization, in which a contrast dye is injected in
an artery using a catheter, is the key tool to confirm
stenosis and gauge its severity.

Treatment
Treatment depends on the symptoms and how
the heart’s function is affected. The valve can be
opened without surgery by using a balloon catheter,
but this is often a temporary solution. The procedure involves inserting a deflated balloon at the end
of a catheter through the arteries to the valve.
Inflating the balloon should widen the valve. In
severe stenosis, heart valve replacement is recommended, most often involving open-heart surgery.
The valve can be replaced with a mechanical valve,
a valve from a pig, or by moving the patient’s other
heart valve (pulmonary) into the position of the
aortic valve and then replacing the pulmonary
valve with an mechanical one. Anyone with aortic
stenosis needs to take antibiotics (amoxicillin, erythromycin, or clindamycin) before dental and some
other surgical procedures, to prevent a heart valve
infection.
370

Cardiac catheterization—A procedure in which
dye is injected through a tube or catheter into an
artery to more easily observe valves or blood vessels seen on an x ray.
Left ventricle—One of the lower chambers of the
heart, which pumps blood to the aorta.
Murmur—An abnormal heart sound that can
reflect a valve dysfunction.
Rheumatic fever—A bacterial infection that often
causes heart inflammation.
Pulmonary valve—The valve located between the
pulmonary artery and the right ventricle, which
brings blood to the lungs.

Prognosis
The prognosis for aortic valve stenosis depends on
the severity of the disease. With surgical repair, the
disease is curable. Patients suffering mild stenosis can
usually lead a normal life; a minority of the patients
progress to severe disease. Anyone with moderate
stenosis should avoid vigorous physical activity.
Most of these patients end up suffering some kind of
coronary heart disease over a 10 year period. Because
it is a progressive disease, moderate and severe stenosis
will be treated ultimately with surgery. Severe disease,
if left untreated, leads to death within 2 to 4 years once
the symptoms start.

Prevention
There is no way to prevent aortic stenosis.

Purpose
Apgar scoring was originally developed in the
1950s by the anesthesiologist Virginia Apgar to assist
practitioners attending a birth in deciding whether or
not a newborn was in need of resuscitation. Using a
scoring method fosters consistency and standardization among different practitioners. A February 2001
study published in the New England Journal of
Medicine investigated whether Apgar scoring continues to be relevant. Researchers concluded that
‘‘The Apgar scoring system remains as relevant for
the prediction of neonatal survival today as it was
almost 50 years ago.’’

Description
The five areas are scored as follows:


Appearance, or color: 2 if the skin is pink all over; 1
for acrocyanosis, where the trunk and head are pink,
but the arms and legs are blue; and 0 if the whole
body is blue. Newborns with naturally darker skin
color will not be pink. However, pallor is still noticeable, especially in the soles and palms. Color is
related to the neonate’s ability to oxygenate its
body and extremities, and is dependent on heart
rate and respirations. A perfectly healthy newborn
will often receive a score of 9 because of some blueness in the hands and feet.



Pulse (heart rate): 2 for a pulse of 100+ beats per
minute (bpm); 1 for a pulse below 100 bpm; 0 for no
pulse. Heart rate is assessed by listening with a

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Preparation
No preparation is needed to perform the test.
However, while being born the neonate may receive
nasal and oral suctioning to remove mucus and
amniotic fluid. This may be done when the head of
the newborn is safely out, while the mother rests
before she continues to push.

Aftercare
Since the test is primarily observational in nature,
no aftercare is needed. However, the test may flag the
need for immediate intervention or prolonged
observation.

Normal results
The maximum possible score is 10, the minimum
is zero. It is rare to receive a true 10, as some acrocyanosis in the newborn is considered normal, and therefore not a cause for concern. Most infants score
between 7 and 10. These infants are expected to have
an excellent outcome. A score of 4, 5, or 6 requires
immediate intervention, usually in the form of oxygen
and respiratory assistance, or perhaps just suctioning
if breathing has been obstructed by mucus. While
suctioning is being done, a source of oxygen may be
placed near, but not over the newborn’s nose and
mouth. This form of oxygen is referred to as blow-by.
A score in the 4-6 range indicates that the neonate is
having some difficulty adapting to extrauterine life.

D R . V I R G I N I A A P G A R (1909–1974)
in New York during the early 1930s and one of the first
women to graduate from its medical school, Apgar knew
that her goal of becoming a surgeon would not be
achieved easily in a male-dominated profession.
Reluctantly, she switched her medical specialty to anesthesiology, she embraced her new field with typical intelligence and energy. At this time, anesthesiology was a
relatively new field, having been left by the doctors
mostly to the attention of nurses. Apgar realized immediately how much in need of scientifically trained personnel
was this significant part of surgery, and she set out to
make anesthesiology a separate medical discipline. By
1937, she had become the fiftieth physician to be certified
as an anesthesiologist in the United States. The following
year she was appointed director of anesthesiology at the
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, becoming the
first woman to head a department at that institution.

As one of very few female medical students at
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons

As the attending anesthesiologist who assisted in the
delivery of thousands of babies during these years, Apgar
realized that infants had died from respiratory or circulatory complications that early treatment could have prevented. Apgar decided to bring her considerable research
skills to this childbirth dilemma, and her careful study
resulted in her publication of the Apgar Score System
in 1952.

Abnormal results

KEY TERMS
Acrocyanosis—A slight cyanosis, or blueness of the
hands and feet of the neonate is considered normal.
This impaired ability to fully oxygenate the extremities is due to an immature circulatory system
which is still in flux.
Amniotic fluid—The protective bag of fluid that
surrounds the fetus while growing in the uterus.
Neonate—A term referring to the newborn infant,
from birth until one month of age.
Neonatologist—A physician who specializes in
problems of newborn infants.
Pallor—Extreme paleness in the color of the skin.

This may be due to medications given to the mother
during a difficult labor, or at the very end of labor,
when these medications have an exaggerated effect on
the neonate.
372

With a score of 0-3, the newborn is unresponsive,
apneic, pale, limp and may not have a pulse.
Interventions to resuscitate will begin immediately.
The test is repeated at five minutes after birth and
both scores are documented. Should the resuscitation
effort continue into the five-minute time period, interventions will not stop in order to perform the test. The
one-minute score indicates the need for intervention at
birth. It addresses survival and prevention of birthrelated complications resulting from inadequate
oxygen supply. Poor oxygenation may be due to
inadequate neurological and/or chemical control of
respiration. The five-minute score appears to have a
more predictive value for morbidity and normal development, although research studies on this are inconsistent in their conclusions.

I Aphasia
Definition
Aphasia is condition characterized by either partial or total loss of the ability to communicate verbally
or using written words. A person with aphasia may
have difficulty speaking, reading, writing, recognizing
the names of objects, or understanding what other
people have said. Aphasia is caused by a brain injury,
as may occur during a traumatic accident or when
the brain is deprived of oxygen during a stroke. It
may also be caused by a brain tumor, a disease such
as Alzheimer’s, or an infection, like encephalitis.
Aphasia may be temporary or permanent. Aphasia
does not include speech impediments caused by loss
of muscle control.

Description
To understand and use language effectively, an
individual draws upon word memory–stored information on what certain words mean, how to put them
together, and how and when to use them properly. For
a majority of people, these and other language functions are located in the left side (hemisphere) of the
brain. Damage to this side of the brain is most commonly linked to the development of aphasia.
Interestingly, however, left-handed people appear to
have language areas in both the left and right hemispheres of the brain and, as a result, may develop
aphasia from damage to either side of the brain.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Broca’s aphasia results from damage to the frontal lobe of the
language-dominant area of the brain. Individuals with
Broca’s aphasia may become mute or may be able to use
single-word statements or full sentences, although it may
require great effort. Wernicke’s aphasia is caused by damage
to the temporal lobe of the language-dominant area of the
brain. People with this condition speak in long, uninterrupted
sentences, but the words used are often unnecessary and
unintelligible. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)

Stroke is the most common cause of aphasia in the
United States. Approximately 500,000 individuals suffer strokes each year, and 20% of these individuals
develop some type of aphasia. Other causes of brain
damage include head injuries, brain tumors, and infection. About half of the people who show signs of aphasia have what is called temporary or transient aphasia
and recover completely within a few days. An estimated
one million Americans suffer from some form of permanent aphasia. As yet, no connection between aphasia
and age, gender, or race has been found.
Aphasia is sometimes confused with other conditions that affect speech, such as dysarthria and
apraxia. These condition affect the muscles used in
speaking rather than language function itself.
Dysarthria is a speech disturbance caused by lack of
control over the muscles used in speaking, perhaps due
to nerve damage. Speech apraxia is a speech disturbance in which language comprehension and muscle
control are retained, but the memory of how to use the
muscles to form words is not.

Aphasia

KEY TERMS
Anomic aphasia—A condition characterized by
either partial or total loss of the ability to recall the
names of persons or things as a result of a stroke,
head injury, brain tumor, or infection.
Broca’s aphasia—A condition characterized by either
partial or total loss of the ability to express oneself,
either through speech or writing. Hearing comprehension is not affected. This condition may result from a
stroke, head injury, brain tumor, or infection.
Computed tomography (CT)—An imaging technique that uses cross-sectional x rays of the body to
create a three-dimensional image of the body’s internal structures.
Conduction aphasia—A condition characterized by
the inability to repeat words, sentences, or phrases as
a result of a stroke, head injury, brain tumor, or
infection.
Frontal lobe—The largest, most forward-facing part
of each side or hemisphere of the brain.
Global aphasia—A condition characterized by either
partial or total loss of the ability to communicate verbally or using written words as a result of widespread
injury to the language areas of the brain. This condition
may be caused by a stroke, head injury, brain tumor,
or infection. The exact language abilities affected vary
depending on the location and extent of injury.

Causes and symptoms
Aphasia can develop after an individual sustains
a brain injury from a stroke, head trauma, tumor, or
infection, such as herpes encephalitis. As a result of
this injury, the pathways for language comprehension or production are disrupted or destroyed. For
most people, this means damage to the left hemisphere of the brain. (In 95 to 99% of right-handed
people, language centers are in the left hemisphere,
and up to 70% of left-handed people also have lefthemisphere language dominance.) According to the
traditional classification scheme, each form of
aphasia is caused by damage to a different part of
the left hemisphere of the brain. This damage affects
one or more of the basic language functions: speech,
naming (the ability to identify an object, color, or
other item with an appropriate word or term), repetition (the ability to repeat words, phrases, and sentences), hearing comprehension (the ability to

Hemisphere—One of the two halves or sides-the left
and the right-of the brain.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)—An imaging
technique that uses a large circular magnet and
radio waves to generate signals from atoms in the
body. These signals are used to construct images of
internal structures.
Subcortical aphasia—A condition characterized by
either partial or total loss of the ability to communicate verbally or using written words as a result of
damage to non language-dominated areas of the
brain. This condition may be caused by a stroke,
head injury, brain tumor, or infection.
Temporal lobe—The part of each side or hemisphere
of the brain that is on the side of the head, nearest the
ears.
Transcortical aphasia—A condition characterized
by either partial or total loss of the ability to communicate verbally or using written words that does not
affect an individual’s ability to repeat words,
phrases, and sentences.

either partial or total loss of the ability to understand
what is being said or read. The individual maintains

understand spoken language), reading (the ability
to understand written words and their meaning),
and writing (the ability to communicate and record
events with text).
The traditional classification scheme includes
eight types of aphasia:


Broca’s aphasia, also called motor aphasia, results
from damage to the front portion or frontal lobe of
the language-dominant area of the brain. Individuals
with Broca’s aphasia may be completely unable to
use speech (mutism) or may be able to use singleword statements or even full sentences, though
these sentences may require a great deal of effort to
construct. Small words, such as conjunctions (and,
or, but) and articles (the, an, a), may be omitted,
leading to a ‘‘telegraph’’ quality in their speech.
Hearing comprehension is usually not affected, so
they are able to understand other people’s speech
and conversation and can follow commands. Often,



Wernicke’s aphasia is caused by damage to the side
portion or temporal lobe of the language-dominant
area of the brain. Individuals with Wernicke’s aphasia speak in long, uninterrupted sentences; however,
the words used are frequently unnecessary or even
made-up. They have a great deal of difficulty understanding other people’s speech, sometimes to the
point of being unable to understand spoken language
at all. Reading ability is diminished, and although
writing ability is retained, what is written may be
abnormal. No physical symptoms, such as the
right-sided weakness seen with Broca’s aphasia, are
typically observed. Also, in contrast to Broca’s aphasia, individuals with Wernicke’s aphasia are not
aware of their language errors.



Global aphasia is caused by widespread damage to
the language areas of the left hemisphere. As a result,
all basic language functions are affected, but some
areas may be more affected than others. For example, an individual may have difficulty speaking but
may be able to write well. The individual may experience weakness and loss of feeling on the right side of
their body.



Conduction aphasia, also called associative aphasia,
is rather uncommon. Individuals with conduction
aphasia are unable to repeat words, sentences, and
phrases. Speech is fairly unbroken, although individuals may frequently correct themselves and words
may be skipped or repeated. Although able to understand spoken language, it may also be difficult for the
individual with conduction aphasia to find the right
word to describe a person or object. The impact of
this condition on reading and writing ability varies.
As with other types of aphasia, right-sided weakness
or sensory loss may be present.



Anomic or nominal aphasia primarily influences an
individual’s ability to find the right name for a person or object. As a result, an object may be described
rather than named. Hearing comprehension, repetition, reading, and writing are not affected, other than
by this inability to find the right name. Speech is
fluent, except for pauses as the individual tries to
recall the right name. Physical symptoms are variable, and some individuals have no symptoms of onesided weakness or sensory loss.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



Transcortical aphasia is caused by damage to the
language areas of the left hemisphere outside the
primary language areas. There are three types of
aphasia: transcortical motor aphasia, transcortical
sensory aphasia, and mixed transcortical aphasia.
All of the transcortical aphasias are distinguished
from other types by the individual’s ability to repeat
words, phrases, or sentences. Other language functions may also be impaired to varying degrees,
depending on the extent and particular location of
brain damage.

As researchers continue to learn more about the
brain’s structure and function, new types of aphasia
are being recognized. One newly recognized type of
aphasia, subcortical aphasia, mimics the symptoms
of other traditional types of aphasia but involves
language disorders that are not typical. This type of
aphasia is associated with injuries to areas of the brain
typically not identified with language and language
processing.

Diagnosis
Following brain injury, an initial bedside assessment is made to determine whether language function has been affected. If the individual experiences
difficulty communicating, attempts are made to
determine whether this difficulty arises from
impaired language comprehension or an impaired
ability to speak. A typical examination involves
listening to spontaneous speech and evaluating the
individual’s ability to recognize and name objects,
comprehend what is heard, and repeat sample words
and phrases. The individual may also be asked to
read text aloud and explain what the passage
means. In addition, writing ability is evaluated by
having the individual copy text, transcribe dictated
text, and write something without prompting.
A speech pathologist or neuropsychologist may
be asked to conduct more extensive examinations
using in-depth, standardized tests. Commonly used
tests include the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia
Examination, the Western Aphasia Battery, and possibly, the Porch Index of Speech Ability.
The results of these tests indicate the severity of
the aphasia and may also provide information regarding the exact location of the brain damage. This more
extensive testing is also designed to provide the information necessary to design an individualized speech
therapy program. Further information about the location of the damage is gained through the use of imaging technology, such as magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and computed tomography scans (CT).
375

Aphasia

they may experience weakness on the right side of
their bodies, which can make it difficult to write.
Reading ability is impaired, and they may have difficulty finding the right word when speaking.
Individuals with Broca’s aphasia may become frustrated and depressed because they are aware of their
language difficulties.

Aplastic anemia

Treatment
Initially, the underlying cause of aphasia must be
treated or stabilized. To regain language function,
therapy must begin as soon as possible following the
injury. Although there are no medical or surgical procedures currently available to treat this condition,
aphasia resulting from stroke or head injury may
improve through the use of speech therapy. For most
individuals, however, the primary emphasis is placed
on making the most of retained language abilities and
learning to use other means of communication to
compensate for lost language abilities.
Speech therapy is tailored to meet individual
needs, but activities and tools that are frequently
used include the following:




Exercise and practice. Weakened muscles are exercised by repetitively speaking certain words or making facial expressions, such as smiling.

Prevention
Because there is no way of knowing when a
stroke, traumatic head injury, or disease will occur,
very little can be done to prevent aphasia. The extent
of recovery, however, in some cases, can be affected
by an individual’s willingness to cooperate and participate in speech therapy directly following the injury.

Prognosis
The degree to which an individual can recover
language abilities is highly dependent on how much
brain damage occurred and the location and cause of
the original brain injury. Other factors include the
individual’s age, general health, motivation and willingness to participate in speech therapy, and whether
the individual is left or right handed. Language areas
may be located in both the left and right hemispheres
in left-handed individuals. Left-handed individuals
are, therefore, more likely to develop aphasia following brain injury, but because they have two language
centers, may recover more fully because language abilities can be recovered from either side of the brain. The
intensity of therapy and the time between diagnosis

I Aplastic anemia
Definition
Aplastic anemia is a disorder in which the bone
marrow greatly decreases or stops production of
blood cells.

Description
The bone marrow (soft tissue that is located
within the hard outer shell of the bones) is responsible
for the production of all types of blood cells. The
mature forms of these cells include red blood cells,
which carry oxygen throughout the body; white
blood cells, which fight infection; and platelets,
which are involved in clotting. In aplastic anemia,
the basic structure of the marrow becomes abnormal,
and those cells responsible for generating blood cells
(hematopoietic cells) are greatly decreased in number
or absent. These hematopoietic cells are replaced by
large quantities of fat.
Yearly, aplastic anemia strikes about 5-10 people
in every one million. Although aplastic anemia strikes
both males and females of all ages, there are two age
groups that have an increased risk. Both young adults

Bone marrow—A substance found in the cavities of
bones, especially the long bones and the sternum
(breast bone). The bone marrow contains those cells
that are responsible for the production of the blood
cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets).
Bone marrow transplant—A procedure in which a
quantity of bone marrow is extracted through a needle from a donor, and then passed into a patient to
replace the patient’s diseased or absent bone marrow.
Hematopoietic cells—Those cells that are lodged
within the bone marrow, and which are responsible
for producing the cells which circulate in the blood
(red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets).

(between 15-30 years of age) and the elderly (over the
age of 60) have higher rates of aplastic anemia than the
general population. While the disorder occurs worldwide, young adults in Asia have a higher disease rate
than do populations in North America and Europe.

Causes and symptoms
Aplastic anemia falls into three basic categories,
based on the origin of its cause: idiopathic, acquired,
and hereditary.
In about 60% of cases, aplastic anemia is considered to be idiopathic, meaning that the cause of the
disorder is unknown.
Acquired aplastic anemia refers to those cases
where certain environmental factors and physical conditions seem to be associated with development of the
disease. Acquired aplastic anemia can be associated
with:


exposure to drugs, especially anti-cancer agents,
antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, seizure
medications, and antithyroid drugs (drugs given to
stop the functioning of an overactive thyroid)



exposure to radiation



chemical exposure (especially to the organic solvent
benzene and certain insecticides)



infection with certain viruses (especially those causing viral hepatitis, as well as Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus, and HIV, the virus that can cause AIDS)



pregnancy



certain other disorders, including a disease called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, an autoimmune

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

reaction called graft-vs-host disease (which occurs
when the body’s immune system attacks and destroys
the body’s own cells), and certain connective tissue
diseases
Hereditary aplastic anemia is relatively rare, but
occurs in Fanconi’s anemia, Shwachman-Diamond
syndrome, and dyskeratosis congenita.
Symptoms of aplastic anemia tend to be those of
other anemias, including fatigue, weakness, tiny reddish-purple marks (petechiae) on the skin (evidence of
pinpoint hemorrhages into the skin), evidence of abnormal bruising, and bleeding from the gums, nose, intestine, or vagina. The patient is likely to appear pale. If
the anemia progresses, decreased oxygen circulating in
the blood may lead to an increase in heart rate and the
sudden appearance of a new heart murmur.

Diagnosis
The blood count in aplastic anemia will reveal low
numbers of all formed blood cells. Red blood cells will
appear normal in size and coloration, but greatly
decreased in number. Cells called reticulocytes (very
young red blood cells, which are usually produced in
great numbers by the bone marrow in order to compensate for a severe anemia) will be very low in number. Platelets and white blood cells will also be
decreased in number, though normal in structure.
A sample of the patient’s bone marrow will need
to be removed by needle (usually from the hip bone)
and examined under a microscope. If aplastic anemia
is present, this examination will reveal very few or no
hematopoietic cells, and replacement with fat.

Treatment
The first step in the treatment of aplastic anemia
involves discontinuing exposure to any substance that
may be causing the disorder. Although it would seem
that blood transfusions would be helpful in this disease, in fact, they only serve as a temporary help, and
may complicate future attempts at bone marrow
transplantation.
The most successful treatment for aplastic anemia
is bone marrow transplantation. To do this, a marrow
donor (often a sibling) must be identified. There are a
number of tissue markers that must be examined to
determine whether a bone marrow donation is likely to
be compatible with the patient’s immune system.
Compatibility is necessary to avoid complications,
including the destruction of the donor marrow by the
patient’s own immune system.

377

Aplastic anemia

KEY TERMS

Appendectomy

Patients who cannot undergo bone marrow
transplant can be treated with a number of agents,
including antithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclophosphamide, steroids, and cyclosporine. These agents
all have the potential to cause a number of troublesome side-effects and may have a success rate of only
60% to 80%. Still, even among those patients who
have a good response, many later suffer a relapse
(return) of aplastic anemia. Researchers are trying to
identify the molecules in certain stem cells that the
immune system targets in aplastic anemia.

Prognosis
Aplastic anemia is a life-threatening illness.
Without treatment, it will almost surely progress to
death. Survival depends on how severe the disease is at
diagnosis, which type of treatment a patient is eligible
for, and what kind of response their body has to that
treatment. The worst-prognosis type of aplastic anemia
is one associated with very low numbers of a particular
type of white blood cell. These patients have a high
chance of dying from overwhelming bacterial infections. In fact, 80% of all patients treated with blood
transfusions alone die within 18 months to two years.
Patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation
have a 60-90% chance of being cured of the disease.

Appendectomies are performed to treat appendicitis, an inflamed and infected appendix.

Precautions
Since appendicitis occurs most commonly in
males between the ages of 10-14 and in females
between the ages of 15-19, appendectomy is most
often performed during this time. The diagnosis of
appendicitis is most difficult in the very young (less
than two years of age) and in the elderly.

Description
Appendectomy is considered a major surgical
operation. Therefore, a general surgeon must perform
this operation in the operating room of a hospital. An
anesthesiologist is also present during the operation to
administer an anesthetic. Most often the anesthesiologist uses a general anesthetic technique whereby
patients are put to sleep and made pain free by
administering drugs in the vein or by agents inhaled
through a tube placed in the windpipe. Occasionally a
spinal anesthetic may be used.
After the patient is anesthetized, the general
surgeon can remove the appendix either by using
the traditional open procedure (in which a 2-3 in
[5-7.6 cm] incision is made in the abdomen) or via
laparoscopy (in which four 1 in [2.5cm] incisions are
made in the abdomen).

I Appendectomy
Definition
Appendectomy is the surgical removal of the
appendix. The appendix is a worm-shaped hollow
pouch attached to the cecum, the beginning of the
large intestine.
378

Purpose

When the surgeon uses the open approach, he
makes an incision in the lower right section of the
abdomen. Most incisions are less than 3 in (7.6 cm)
in length. The surgeon then identifies all of the organs
in the abdomen and examines them for other disease
or abnormalities. The appendix is located and brought
up into the wounds. The surgeon separates the appendix from all the surrounding tissue and its attachment
to the cecum and then removes it. The site where the
appendix was previously attached, the cecum, is closed
and returned to the abdomen. The muscle layers and
then the skin are sewn together.
Laproscopic appendectomy
When the surgeon conducts a laproscopic appendectomy, four incisions, each about 1 in (2.5 cm) in
length, are made. One incision is near the umbilicus, or
navel, and one is between the umbilicus and the pubis.
Two other incisions are smaller and are in the right

side of the lower abdomen. The surgeon then passes a
camera and special instruments through these incisions. With the aid of this equipment, the surgeon
visually examines the abdominal organs and identifies
the appendix. Similarly, the appendix is freed from
all of its attachments and removed. The place where
the appendix was formerly attached, the cecum, is
stitched. The appendix is removed through one of the
incisions. The instruments are removed and then all of
the incisions are closed.
Studies and opinions about the relative advantages and disadvantages of each method are divided.
A skilled surgeon can perform either one of these
procedures in less than one hour. However, laproscopic appendectomy (LA) always takes longer than
traditional appendectomy (TA). The increased time
required to do a LA increases the patient’s exposure
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

to anesthetics, which increases the risk of complications. The increased time requirement also escalates
fees charged by the hospital for operating room time
and by the anesthesiologist. Since LA also requires
specialized equipment, the fees for its use also
increases the hospital charges. Patients with either
operation have similar pain medication needs, begin
eating diets at comparable times, and stay in the hospital equivalent amounts of time. LA is of special
benefit in women in whom the diagnosis is difficult
and gynecological disease (such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, ruptured ovarian follicles,
ruptured ovarian cysts, and tubal pregnancies) may be
the source of pain and not appendicitis. If LA is done
in these patients, the pelvic organs can be more thoroughly examined and a definitive diagnosis made prior
to removal of the appendix. Most surgeons select

tissues or in a body cavity.
Anesthesiologist—A physician who has special
training and expertise in the delivery of anesthetics.
Anesthetics—Drugs or methodologies used to
make a body area free of sensation or pain.
Cecum—The beginning of the large intestine and
the place where the appendix attaches to the intestinal tract.
General surgeon—A physician who has special
training and expertise in performing a variety of
operations.
Pelvic organs— The organs inside of the body that
are located within the confines of the pelvis. This
includes the bladder and rectum in both sexes and
the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes in females.
Pubis—The anterior portion of the pelvis located in
the anterior abdomen.
Thrombophlebitis—Inflammation of the veins,
usually in the legs, which causes swelling and tenderness in the affected area.
Umbilicus—The navel.

either TA or LA based on the individual needs and
circumstances of the patient.
Insurance plans do cover the costs of appendectomy. Fees are charged independently by the hospital
and the physicians. Hospital charges include fees for
operating and recovery room use, diagnostic and
laboratory testing, as well as the normal hospital
room charges. Surgical fees vary from region to region
and range between $250-$750. The anesthesiologist’s
fee depends upon the health of the patient and the
length of the operation.

Preparation
Once the diagnosis of appendicitis is made and the
decision has been made to perform an appendectomy,
the patient undergoes the standard preparation for an
operation. This usually takes only one to two hours
and includes signing the operative consents, patient
identification procedures, evaluation by the anesthesiologist, and moving the patient to the operating suites
of the hospital. Occasionally, if the patient has been ill
for a prolonged period of time or has had protracted
380

vomiting, a delay of few to several hours may be necessary to give the patient fluids and antibiotics.

Aftercare
Recovery from an appendectomy is similar to
other operations. Patients are allowed to eat when
the stomach and intestines begin to function again.
Usually the first meal is a clear liquid diet–broth,
juice, soda pop, and gelatin. If patients tolerate this
meal, the next meal usually is a regular diet. Patients
are asked to walk and resume their normal physical
activities as soon as possible. If TA was done, work
and physical education classes may be restricted for a
full three weeks after the operation. If a LA was done,
most patients are able to return to work and strenuous
activity within one to three weeks after the operation.

Risks
Certain risks are present when any operation
requires a general anesthetic and the abdominal cavity
is opened. Pneumonia and collapse of the small airways (atelectasis) often occurs. Patients who smoke
are at a greater risk for developing these complications. Thrombophlebitis, or inflammation of the
veins, is rare but can occur if the patient requires
prolonged bed rest. Bleeding can occur but rarely is a
blood transfusion required. Adhesions (abnormal connections to abdominal organs by thin fibrous tissue) is
a known complication of any abdominal procedure
such as appendectomy. These adhesions can lead to
intestinal obstruction which prevents the normal flow
of intestinal contents. Hernia is a complication of any
incision, However, they are rarely seen after appendectomy because the abdominal wall is very strong in
the area of the standard appendectomy incision.
The overall complication rate of appendectomy
depends upon the status of the appendix at the time
it is removed. If the appendix has not ruptured the
complication rate is only about 3%. However, if the
appendix has ruptured the complication rate rises to
almost 59%. Wound infections do occur and are more
common if the appendicitis was severe, far advanced,
or ruptured. An abscess may form in the abdomen as a
complication of appendicitis.
Occasionally, an appendix will rupture prior to its
removal, spilling its contents into the abdominal cavity.
Peritonitis or a generalized infection in the abdomen
will occur. Treatment of peritonitis as a result of a
ruptured appendix includes removal of what remains
of the appendix, insertion of drains (rubber tubes that
promote the flow of infection inside the abdomen to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Appendicitis

outside of the body), and antibiotics. Fistula formation
(an abnormal connection between the cecum and the
skin) rarely occurs. It is only seen if the appendix has a
broad attachment to the cecum and the appendicitis is
far advanced causing destruction of the cecum itself.

Normal results
Most patients feel better immediately after an
operation for appendicitis. Many patients are discharged from the hospital within 24 hours after the
appendectomy. Others may require a longer stay–
three to five days. Almost all patients are back to
their normal activities within three weeks.
The mortality rate of appendicitis has dramatically
decreased over time. Currently, the mortality rate is
estimated at one to two per 1,000,000 cases of appendicitis. Death is usually due to peritonitis, intra abdominal abscess or severe infection following rupture.
The complications associated with undiagnosed,
misdiagnosised, or delayed diagnosis of appendectomy are very significant. The diagnosis is of appendicitis is difficult and never certain. This has led surgeons
to perform an appendectomy any time that they feel
appendicitis is the diagnosis. Most surgeons feel that
in approximately 20% of their patients, a normal
appendix will be removed. Rates much lower than
this would seem to indicate that the diagnosis of
appendicitis was being frequently missed.

cecum, the beginning of the large intestine. The appendix has no known function in the body, but it can
become diseased. Appendicitis is a medical emergency,
and if it is left untreated the appendix may rupture and
cause a potentially fatal infection.

Description
Appendicitis is the most common abdominal
emergency found in children and young adults. One
person in 15 develops appendicitis in his or her lifetime. The incidence is highest among males aged
10-14, and among females aged 15-19. More males
than females develop appendicitis between puberty
and age 25. It is rare in the elderly and in children
under the age of two.
The hallmark symptom of appendicitis is increasingly severe abdominal pain. Since many different conditions can cause abdominal pain, an accurate
diagnosis of appendicitis can be difficult. A timely
diagnosis is important, however, because a delay can
result in perforation, or rupture, of the appendix.
When this happens, the infected contents of the appendix spill into the abdomen, potentially causing a serious infection of the abdomen called peritonitis.

Appendicitis

KEY TERMS
Appendectomy (or appendicectomy)—Surgical
removal of the appendix.
Appendix—The worm-shaped pouch attached to
the cecum, the beginning of the large intestine.
Laparotomy—Surgical incision into the loin,
between the ribs and the pelvis, which offers surgeons a view inside the abdominal cavity.
Peritonitis—Inflammation of the peritoneum,
membranes lining the abdominal pelvic wall.

Other conditions can have similar symptoms,
especially in women. These include pelvic inflammatory disease, ruptured ovarian follicles, ruptured ovarian cysts, tubal pregnancies, and endometriosis.
Various forms of stomach upset and bowel inflammation may also mimic appendicitis.
The treatment for acute (sudden, severe) appendicitis is an appendectomy, surgery to remove the appendix. Because of the potential for a life-threatening
ruptured appendix, persons suspected of having
appendicitis are often taken to surgery before the
diagnosis is certain.

Causes and symptoms
The causes of appendicitis are not well understood, but it is believed to occur as a result of one or
more of these factors: an obstruction within the
appendix, the development of an ulceration (an abnormal change in tissue accompanied by the death of
cells) within the appendix, and the invasion of
bacteria.
Under these conditions, bacteria may multiply
within the appendix. The appendix may become swollen and filled with pus (a fluid formed in infected tissue,
consisting of while blood cells and cellular debris), and
may eventually rupture. Signs of rupture include the
presence of symptoms for more than 24 hours, a fever, a
high white blood cell count, and a fast heart rate. Very
rarely, the inflammation and symptoms of appendicitis
may disappear but recur again later.
The distinguishing symptom of appendicitis is
pain beginning around or above the navel. The pain,
which may be severe or only achy and uncomfortable,
eventually moves into the right lower corner of the
abdomen. There, it becomes more steady and more
severe, and often increases with movement, coughing,
382

and so forth. The abdomen often becomes rigid and
tender to the touch. Increasing rigidity and tenderness
indicates an increased likelihood of perforation and
peritonitis.
Loss of appetite is very common. Nausea and
vomiting may occur in about half of the cases and
occasionally there may be constipation or diarrhea.
The temperature may be normal or slightly elevated.
The presence of a fever may indicate that the appendix
has ruptured.

Diagnosis
A careful examination is the best way to diagnose appendicitis. It is often difficult even for
experienced physicians to distinguish the symptoms
of appendicitis from those of other abdominal disorders. Therefore, very specific questioning and a
thorough physical examination are crucial. The
physician should ask questions, such as where the
pain is centered, whether the pain has shifted, and
where the pain began. The physician should press
on the abdomen to judge the location of the pain
and the degree of tenderness.
The typical sequence of symptoms is present in
about 50% of cases. In the other half of cases, less
typical patterns may be seen, especially in pregnant
women, older patients, and infants. In pregnant
women, appendicitis is easily masked by the frequent occurrence of mild abdominal pain and
nausea from other causes. Elderly patients may
feel less pain and tenderness than most patients,
thereby delaying diagnosis and treatment, and
leading to rupture in 30% of cases. Infants and
young children often have diarrhea, vomiting,
and fever in addition to pain.
While laboratory tests cannot establish the diagnosis, an increased white cell count may point to
appendicitis. Urinalysis may help to rule out a urinary
tract infection that can mimic appendicitis.
Patients whose symptoms and physical examination are compatible with a diagnosis of appendicitis
are usually taken immediately to surgery, where a
laparotomy (surgical exploration of the abdomen) is
done to confirm the diagnosis. In cases with a questionable diagnosis, other tests, such as a computed
tomography scan (CT) may be performed to avoid
unnecessary surgery. An ultrasound examination of
the abdomen may help to identify an inflamed appendix or other condition that would explain the symptoms. Abdominal x-rays are not of much value except
when the appendix has ruptured.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

When appendicitis is strongly suspected in a
woman of child-bearing age, a diagnostic laparoscopy
(an examination of the interior of the abdomen) is
sometimes recommended before the appendectomy in
order to be sure that a gynecological problem, such as a
ruptured ovarian cyst, is not causing the pain. In this
procedure, a lighted viewing tube is inserted into the
abdomen through a small incision around the navel.
A normal appendix is discovered in about 10-20%
of patients who undergo laparotomy, because of suspected appendicitis. Sometimes the surgeon will
remove a normal appendix as a safeguard against
appendicitis in the future. During the surgery, another
specific cause for the pain and symptoms of appendicitis is found for about 30% of these patients.

Treatment
The treatment of appendicitis is an immediate
appendectomy. This may be done by opening the abdomen in the standard open appendectomy technique, or
through laparoscopy. In laparoscopy, a smaller incision
is made through the navel. Both methods can successfully accomplish the removal of the appendix. It is not
certain that laparoscopy holds any advantage over open
appendectomy. When the appendix has ruptured,
patients undergoing a laparoscopic appendectomy may
have to be switched to the open appendectomy procedure for the successful management of the rupture. If a
ruptured appendix is left untreated, the condition is fatal.

Prognosis
Appendicitis is usually treated successfully by
appendectomy. Unless there are complications, the
patient should recover without further problems. The
mortality rate in cases without complications is less
than 0.1%. When an appendix has ruptured, or a
severe infection has developed, the likelihood is higher
for complications, with slower recovery, or death from
disease. There are higher rates of perforation and
mortality among children and the elderly.

Prevention
Appendicitis is probably not preventable, although
there is some indication that a diet high in green vegetables and tomatoes may help prevent appendicitis.

I Appetite-enhancing drugs
Definition
Appetite-enhancing drugs are a diverse group of
medications given to prevent undesired weight loss in
the elderly and in patients suffering from such diseases
as AIDS and cancer, which often result in wasting of
the body’s muscle tissue as well as overall weight loss.
The medical term for these drugs is orexigenic, which
is derived from the Greek word for ‘‘appetite’’ or
‘‘desire.’’ None of the orexigenic drugs in common
use as of 2005, however, were originally formulated
or prescribed as appetite stimulants; they range from
antihistamines and antiemetics (drugs given to treat or
prevent nausea and vomiting) to antidepressants and
synthetic hormones. The medications most often used
in the early 2000s include mirtazapine (Remeron), a
tetracyclic antidepressant; cyproheptadine (Periactin),
an antihistamine; dronabinol (Marinol, THC), an
antiemetic; nandrolone, oxymetholone, and oxandrolone (Anadrol-50, Durabolin, Hybolin, Oxandrin, and
other brand nam! es), which are anabolic steroids
related to the male sex hormone testosterone; and
megestrol acetate (Megace), a synthetic derivative of
the female sex hormone progesterone. In addition to
these prescription drugs, fish oil (eicosapentaenoic acid
or EPA) has been recommended as an alternative
or complementary treatment for undesired weight loss.

Purpose
The reader should note the distinction between
appetite and hunger in order to understand why a
group of such different medications could be used to
stimulate the desire for food. Hunger is defined as the
body’s basic physical need for food, whether in terms
of calorie content or specific nutrients. Appetite, on
the other hand, refers to the complex desires in
humans for food and drink that are often conditioned
or influenced by previous experiences or cultural factors as well as by a person’s present health status.
383

Appetite-enhancing drugs

Often, the diagnosis is not certain until an operation is done. To avoid a ruptured appendix, surgery
may be recommended without delay if the symptoms
point clearly to appendicitis. If the symptoms are not
clear, surgery may be postponed until they progress
enough to confirm a diagnosis.

Appetite-enhancing drugs

People may have an appetite for food in the absence of
hunger; conversely, they may be hungry in the physical
sense but have little or no appetite. Loss of appetite
may lead to a type of malnutrition known as undernutrition, which is characterized by food intake that
falls below a recommended daily allowance of calories
or by the body’s inability to make use of the nutrients
in the food that is consumed.
People may become anorexic (lose their appetite
for food) for a variety of physical, emotional, and
social reasons:


Sensory changes related to aging. Elderly persons
often experience a partial loss of the senses of taste
and smell, which means that they may not enjoy their
meals as much as they did when they were younger.
In addition, many elderly persons feel full after eating relatively small amounts of food. It is thought
that this early feeling of fullness is caused by
increased secretion of gastric hormones known as
cholecystokinins.



Gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with such disorders as Crohn’s disease or gastric atonia (abnormally
slow emptying of the stomach) may lose their appetite for food.



Severe diseases that affect the entire body, particularly cancer and AIDS. Patients with these diseases
may develop cachexia, a potentially life-threatening
condition characterized by unintended weight loss
and wasting of lean muscle tissue. Cachexia is often
accompanied by loss of appetite.



Medication side effects. In addition to the drugs used
in cancer chemotherapy, such drugs as fluoxetine
(Prozac), digoxin (Lanoxin), quinidine (Duraquin,
Cardioquin), hydralazine (Alazine, Apresoline), certain antibiotics, and vitamin A may cause loss of
appetite.



Emotional stress. Many people do not feel like eating
before examinations, job interviews, public speaking,
artistic performances, athletic competitions, or similar stressful situations.



Depression and other mood disorders. Loss of appetite is a common feature of depressive episodes as
well as of major depressive disorder.



Cultural factors. The types of food that people find
appetizing are influenced by their respective cultures;
for example, Westerners usually find the use of cats
and dogs for food in China and Korea upsetting or
disgusting because they regard these animals as
domestic pets rather than dietary items. In addition,
many people lose their appetite when they discover
insects, hair, or other evidence of unsanitary

384

conditions in their food, or when they find that a
dish’s ingredients violate the dietary laws of their
religion.


Social isolation. Research indicates that human
appetite for food is stimulated by eating in the company of others. Loss of appetite in many elderly
people is associated with living alone.



Previous experience. People who have developed
food poisoning after eating contaminated or improperly refrigerated salads, raw clams or oysters, or
similar foods may develop a long-term distaste for
the food that made them sick.

Given the complexity and variety of factors that
influence the desire for food in humans, doctors often
use such questionnaires as the Mini Nutritional
Assessment or the Nutrition Screening Index before
prescribing any appetite-enhancing drug. Many
patients can be successfully treated by changes in the
type or dosage of medications they are taking for
other conditions, or by therapy directed at an underlying mood disorder or gastrointestinal disease.
Others can be helped by changes in their living situations that allow them to share mealtimes with others
or by assistance in preparing foods that they particularly enjoy. The American Academy of Home Care
Physicians (AAHCP) noted in a report published in
May 2004 that the use of orexigenic drugs in the
elderly is ‘‘controversial and not generally FDAapproved.’’

Description
Orexigenic drugs used in the United States as of
2005 are classified as follows:


Mirtazapine. Mirtazapine is a tetracyclic antidepressant that was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in 1996 for the treatment of
major depression. Although researchers do not fully
understand why mirtazapine relieves mood disorders, they think that it increases the levels of noradrenaline and serotonin (chemicals that transmit
nerve impulses across the gaps between cells) in the
brain. Mirtazapine is most often prescribed as an
appetite stimulant for patients who have been previously diagnosed with depression.



Cyproheptadine. Cyproheptadine is an antihistamine given to relieve the symptoms of colds, nasal
allergies, and hay fever. It is also prescribed to relieve
the itching associated with insect bites and stings,
poison ivy, and poison oak. It appears to be most
effective in treating loss of appetite in children and
adults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Anabolic steroids—A group of drugs derived from
the male sex hormone testosterone, most commonly prescribed to promote growth or to help
the body repair tissues weakened by severe illness
or aging. Some anabolic steroids are given as appetite stimulants.



Anorexia—Loss of appetite for food.
Antiemetic—A type of medication given to relieve
or prevent nausea and vomiting. Some appetiteenhancing drugs are also used as antiemetics.
Appetite—The natural instinctive desire for food. It
should be distinguished from hunger, which is the
body’s craving or need for food (either calories or
specific nutrients).
Cachexia—A condition of general ill health, malnutrition, undesired weight loss, and physical
weakness, often associated with cancer.
Off-label—Referring to the use of a drug for a condition or disorder not listed in the official FDA
labeling.
Orexigenic—The medical term for drugs that
increase or stimulate the appetite.
Palliative—Referring to drugs or other therapies
intended to relieve the symptoms of a disease rather

Recommended dosage
Recommended dosages for orexigenic drugs are
as follows:


Mirtazapine. Mirtazapine is available in 15- and 30mg tablets or disintegrating tablets. The usual starting dose is 15 mg once daily, usually at bedtime. The
drug can be taken with or without food, as the
patient prefers.



Cyproheptadine. Cyproheptadine is taken by mouth,
either as tablets or in liquid form. Adults are usually
given 4 mg three or four times per day. Children
between 2 and 6 years of age are usually given 12
mg per day in 3–4 divided doses while older children
are given 16 mg per day in divided doses.



Dronabinol. As an appetite stimulant, dronabinol is
given as a 2.5-mg capsule twice a day, before lunch
and dinner. Some AIDS patients may be given as
much as 10 mg per day.



Anabolic steroids. Oxandrolone and oxymetholone
are available in the United States and Canada as
tablets, while nandrolone is given by injection. To
build up body tissues after injury or serious illness,
the adult dosage of oxandrolone is a 2.5-mg tablet
taken by mouth two to four times daily for a period
of four weeks, although the total daily dosage may be
raised as high as 20 mg. To treat anemia, oxymetholone is prescribed according to the patient’s body
weight, usually 0.45–2.3 mg per pound of body
weight per day in adults and children. Nandrolone
is given by injection every three to four weeks for a
period of 12 weeks. The usual dosage for women and
girls over 14 is 50–100 mg; for men and boys over 14,

Undernutrition—A type of malnutrition caused by
inadequate food intake or the body’s inability to
make use of needed nutrients.



Dronabinol. Dronabinol is a synthetic version of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the mood-altering compound found in marijuana (Cannabis sativa).
Marijuana has been known as an appetite stimulant
for centuries, having been recommended for that purpose by Ayurvedic practitioners and by the Arabic
physician Al Badri, who first described its orexigenic
properties in 1251. Dronabinol is most commonly
used to treat the nausea and vomiting associated with
AIDS and with cancer chemotherapy.



Anabolic steroids. These drugs are given to older persons to increase muscle mass and strength, or to help
patients recovering from severe illness or injury to
regain lost weight.



Megestrol acetate. Megestrol acetate was first
approved by the FDA in 1976 for palliative treatment of metastatic breast or endometrial cancer. It
received additional approval in 1993 for the

Fish oil. Fish oil is recommended by some practitioners as a nutritional supplement for weight loss
caused by cancer or AIDS. It is thought that the
omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil help to reduce the
inflammation associated with some forms of cancer
therapy as well as helping patients regain lost weight.
Although some studies question the effectiveness of
fish oil as a complementary treatment for undesired
weight loss, the National Center for Complementary
and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) is recruiting
patients as of April 2005 for a clinical trial of fish
oil as a dietary supplement to maintain weight in
patients with pancreatic cancer. The study will be
completed in September 2007.

15–50 mg.


Megestrol acetate. Megestrol acetate is given as a
liquid suspension in 200-mg doses every 6 hours.



Fish oil. A recommended dose for cancer-induced
weight loss is 12 g daily, taken by mouth. Fish oil is
available in capsules as well as liquid forms.



Anabolic steroids. Patients taking these drugs must
follow a diet high in protein and calories in order to
benefit from the medications, and should be carefully
supervised by their doctor because of possible side
effects. Children or teenagers taking these drugs
should have x-rays every six months to make sure
they are growing normally, as anabolic steroids can
interfere with growth. Patients with diabetes should
check their blood sugar levels with extra care, as
these drugs may cause rapid changes in blood sugar
levels.



Megestrol acetate. This drug should not be used by
pregnant or lactating women, or by women planning
to become pregnant. Women of childbearing age
who are taking megestrol should use a reliable form
of contraception.



Fish oil. Fish oil is not a prescription drug; however,
patients who choose to take cod liver oil as their fish
oil supplement should make sure that they are not
getting more than the safe maximum daily allowances of vitamins A and D. These vitamins tend to build
up in the body and may reach toxic levels. The maximum safe daily level of vitamin A for adults is 3000
micrograms (mcg).

Precautions
Precautions for orexigenic drugs are as follows:






Mirtazapine. In January 2005 the FDA required
labeling changes for mirtazapine to warn of the
increased risk of suicide or self-harm in children or
adolescents taking this drug. Mirtazapine should not
be given to children below 18 years of age, and
should be used with caution in pregnant or lactating
women. Patients taking mirtazapine should not stop
taking it without telling their doctor; it should not be
discontinued abruptly but taken in progressively
smaller doses over a period of time. This precaution
is particularly important in patients who have been
taking the drug for a long time.
Cyproheptadine. This drug should not be given to
patients who suffer acute asthma attacks or are
hypersensitive to antihistamines. It should not be
given to patients who have taken phenelzine
(Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate), or other MAO
inhibitors within the last two weeks. Cyproheptadine
should be used cautiously in the elderly and in
patients with glaucoma, high blood pressure, or cardiovascular disease.
Dronabinol. Patients taking dronabinol should
be closely supervised by their doctor, as the
drug may cause unpredictable changes in blood
pressure and heart rate. In addition, it may make
certain mental disorders worse. It also has a high
potential for abuse; for this reason, it should be
used cautiously in patients with a history of
alcohol or drug abuse. Dronabinol should not
be used by nursing mothers because it passes
into breast milk. It should be used with great
caution in children or patients diagnosed with
severe mental illness because of its effects on
the mind. Patients taking dronabinol should
notify their dentist or surgeon before any procedure requiring local or general anesthesia, as the
drug may intensify the effects of the anesthetic.
In addition, these patients should not drive a car
or operate dangerous machinery until they know
whether dronabinol makes them dizzy, drowsy,
or uncoordinated.

386

Side effects
Side effects reported for orexigenic drugs are as
follows:


Mirtazapine. Mirtazapine may cause mood changes,
including worsening depression or thoughts of suicide. It may also cause panic attacks, irritability,
difficulty with impulse control, abnormal levels of
excitement, or difficulty sleeping. Physical side
effects may include sleepiness, dry mouth, constipation, nausea and vomiting, flu-like symptoms, chest
pain, and rapid heartbeat. Patients who have any of
these side effects should consult their doctor at once.



Cyproheptadine. Side effects include drowsiness,
fatigue, dry mouth, skin rash, chest congestion, headache, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, difficulty urinating, and blurred vision. Patients who experience
urinary or vision problems should consult their doctor at once.



Dronabinol. Dronabinol may cause a variety of
changes in mental status, including delirium, confusion, hallucinations, memory loss, delusions, euphoria
(false sense of well-being), nervousness or anxiety.
Because of the possibility of severe mental side
effects, anyone who has taken an overdose of dronabinol needs immediate emergency medical help. The
drug may also cause clumsiness or lightheadedness,

Anabolic steroids. These drugs have been reported to
cause a rare form of liver disease; patients who notice
yellowing of the eyes or skin, or black, tarry stools,
sore throat and fever, vomiting of blood, or purplish
or reddish spots on the body should contact their
doctor at once. Other side effects include feeling
chilly, diarrhea, muscle cramps, unusual increase or
decrease in sexual desire, acne or oily skin, bone pain,
nausea, or vomiting. Women may notice deepening
of the voice, hair loss, unnatural hair growth (hirsutism), or irregular menstrual periods. Adult males
may notice enlargement of the breasts (gynecomastia), frequent need to urinate, or frequent erections.
Elderly males may have difficulty urinating.
Megestrol acetate. Side effects of megestrol acetate
include swelling of the hands, feet, or lower legs;
headaches; sore breasts; or decreased sexual desire.
Men taking this drug may become impotent. Women
may notice vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain.
Fish oil. Some people taking fish oil as a dietary
supplement experience an increased tendency to
burp followed by a fishy taste in the mouth.

Interactions
Most orexigenic drugs interact with a number of
other medications:


Mirtazapine. Mirtazapine may cause high blood
pressure or abnormally high body temperature if
taken together with MAO inhibitors (furazolidone,
phenelzine, procarbazine, selegiline, or tranylcypromine). It intensifies the sedating (sleep-inducing)
effects of alcohol, benzodiazepine tranquilizers, antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, narcotic pain
relievers, and some medications given for high
blood pressure.



Cyproheptadine. Cyproheptadine intensifies and
prolongs the effects of other antihistamines, alcohol,
barbiturates, narcotic pain relievers, benzodiazepine
tranquilizers, and antidepressant medications.



Dronabinol. Dronabinol intensifies the effects of
alcohol and other medications that act as central
nervous system depressants. These groups of drugs
include barbiturates, benzodiazepine tranquilizers,
tetracyclic and tricyclic antidepressants, narcotic
pain relievers, antiseizure medications, antihistamines, muscle relaxants, and anesthetics, including
dental anesthetics.

I Apraxia
Definition
Apraxia is neurological condition characterized
by loss of the ability to perform activities that a person
is physically able and willing to do.

Description
Apraxia is caused by brain damage related to
conditions such as head injury, stroke, brain tumor,
and Alzheimer’s disease. The damage affects the
brain’s ability to correctly signal instructions to the
body. Forms of apraxia include the inability to say
some words or make gestures.
Various conditions cause apraxia, and it can affect
people of all ages. A baby might be born with the
condition. A car accident or fall that resulted in head
trauma could lead to apraxia.
From 500,000 to 750,000 people need to be hospitalized each year for head injuries according to the
American Medical Association (AMA). Men between
the ages of 18 and 24 form the largest group of people
with head injuries. While not all severe injuries result
in apraxia, men in that age group are at risk.
Risk factors for strokes include high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. Cigarette smoking
also puts a person at risk for a stroke. Brain tumors
are abnormal tissue growths in the skull. They may be
secondary tumors caused by the spread of cancer
through the body.
There is more than one type of apraxia, and a
person may have one or more form of this condition.
Furthermore, a milder form of apraxia is called
dyspraxia.

Causes and symptoms
Apraxia is caused by conditions that affect parts
of the brain that control movements. Apraxia is a
result of damage to the brain’s cerebral hemispheres.
These are the two halves of the cerebrum and are the
location of brain activities such as voluntary
movements.
Apraxia causes a lapse in carrying out movements
that a person knows how to do, is physically able to
perform, and wants to do. A person may be willing
and able to do something like bathe. However, the
brain does not send the signals that allow the person
to perform the necessary sequence of activities to do
this correctly.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

CT scanning—Computer tomography scanning is a
diagnostic imaging tool that uses x rays sent
through the body at different angles.
MRI—Magnetic resonance imaging is a diagnostic
imaging tool that utilizes an electromagnetic field
and radio waves.

Types of apraxia
There are several types of apraxia, and a patient
could be diagnosed with one or more forms of this
condition. The types of apraxia include:


Buccofacial or orofacial apraxia is the inability of a
person to follow through on commands involving
face and lip motions. These activities include coughing, licking the lips, whistling, and winking. Also
known as facial-oral apraxia, it is the most common
form of apraxia, according to the National Institute
of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).



Limb-kinetic apraxia is the inability to make precise
movements with an arm or leg.



Ideomotor apraxia is the inability to make the proper
movement in response to a command to pantomime
an activity like waving.



Constructional apraxia is the inability to copy, draw,
or build simple figures.



Ideational apraxia is the inability to do an activity
that involves performing a series of movements in a
sequence. A person with this condition could have
trouble dressing, eating, or bathing. It is also known
as conceptual apraxia.



Oculomotor apraxia is characterized by difficulty
moving the eyes.



Verbal apraxia is a condition involving difficulty
coordinating mouth and speech movements. It is
referred to as apraxia of speech by organizations
including the American Speech Language Hearing
Association (ASHA).

A baby who does not coo or babble may display a
symptom of apraxia of speech, according to ASHA. A
young child may only say a few consonant sounds, and
an older child may have difficulty imitating speech. An
adult also has this difficulty. Other symptoms include
saying the wrong words. A person wants to say
‘‘kitchen,’’ but says ‘‘bipem’’ instead, according to an
ASHA report.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

A person diagnosed with apraxia may also have
aphasia, a condition caused by damage to the brain’s
speech centers. This results in difficulty reading, witting, speaking, and understanding when others speak.
Post-apraxia changes
A person with apraxia could experience frustration about difficulty communicating or trouble performing tasks. In some cases, the condition could
affect the person’s ability to live independently.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of apraxia could begin with testing of
its underlying cause. Testing for conditions like a
stroke or cancer includes the MRI (magnetic resonance
imaging) and CT scanning (computer tomography
scanning). A brain biopsy is used to measure changes
caused by Alzheimer’s disease. In all cases, the physician takes a family history. Head trauma that could
cause apraxia is first treated in the emergency room.
Other diagnostic treatment is related to identifying the type of apraxia. For example, the physician
may ask the patient to demonstrate how to blow out a
candle, wave, use a fork, or use a toothbrush.
Assessment for speech apraxia in children
includes a hearing evaluation to determine if difficulty
in speaking is related to a hearing loss. If the condition
appears related to apraxia, a speech-language pathologist examines muscle development in the jaw, lips,
and tongue. The examination of adults and children
includes an evaluation of how words are pronounced
individually and in conversation. The pathologist
observes how the patient breathes when speaking
and the ability to perform actions like smiling.
The costs of diagnosis vary because the process
could include examinations and diagnostic screening
related to the underlying cost of the apraxia. Insurance
generally covers part of these costs.

Treatment
The treatment for apraxia usually involves rehabilitation through speech-language therapy, physical
therapy, or occupational therapy. In addition, treatment such as chemotherapy is administered for the
condition that caused the apraxia.
Family education is an important component of
apraxia treatment. The rehabilitation process takes
time, and relatives can offer encouragement and support
to the patient. They may be asked to help the patient
with in-home exercises. Furthermore, family members
sometimes need to take on the role of caregivers.

KEY TERMS

Apraxia

Speech-language therapy
Speech-language therapy focuses on helping the
patients learn or regain communication skills.
Therapists teach exercises to strengthen facial muscles
used in speech. Other exercises concentrate on patients
learning to correctly pronounce sounds and then turn
those sounds into words.
In cases where apraxia limits the ability to speak,
therapists help patients develop alternate means of
communication. These alternatives range from gesturing to using a portable computer that writes and produces speech, according to ASHA.
Occupational and physical therapies
Occupational and physical therapies focus on
helping patients regain the skills impaired by apraxia.
Physical therapy exercises concentrate on areas such
as mobility and balance. Occupational therapy helps
patients relearn daily living skills.

be required, and some people with dementia require
supervised, longterm care.

Prevention
The methods of preventing apraxia focus on preventing the underlying causes of this condition. This
may not be entirely possible when there is a family
history of conditions such as stroke, dementia, and
cancer. However, a person at risk by not smoking,
exercising, and eating a diet based on the American
Heart Association guidelines.
Head injury can be prevented by wearing a helmet
when participating in activities like sports and bicycling. Wearing a seatbelt when in a vehicle also helps
reduce the risk of head injury.

Treatment costs
The costs of therapy vary by the type of treatment,
regional location, and where the therapy is offered.
Fees can range for $40 per hour for in-office speech
therapy for a child to $85 per hour for in-home physical or occupational therapy for a senior citizen. Part of
therapy costs may be covered by insurance.

Alternative treatment
Most alternative treatments target Alzheimer’s
disease and other conditions that cause apraxia.
Herbal remedies thought to help people with
Alzheimer’s include ginkgo biloba, a plant extract.
However, organizations including the Alzheimer’s
Association caution that the effectiveness and safety
of this herbal remedy has not been evaluated by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The government
does not require a review of supplements like ginkgo.
Furthermore, there is a risk of internal bleeding if
ginkgo is taken in combination with aspirin and
blood-thinning medications.

Prognosis
The prognosis for apraxia depends on factors such
as what caused the condition. While Alzheimer’s is a
degenerative condition, a child with verbal apraxia or
a stroke patient could make progress.
In some cases, treatment helps a person to relearn
or acquire skills needed to function. A caregiver may

I Arbovirus encephalitis
Definition
Encephalitis is a serious inflammation of the
brain, Arbovirus encephalitis is caused by a virus
from the Arbovirus group. The term arbovirus stands
for Arthro-pod-borne virus because these viruses are
passed to humans by members of the phylum
Arthropoda (which includes insects and spiders).

Description
Of the huge number of arboviruses known to
exist, about 80 types are responsible for human disease. In addition to the virus, there are usually two
other types of living creatures involved in the cycle
leading to human disease. When large quantities of
virus are present in an arthropod (often a tick or
mosquito), the viruses are passed to a bird or small
mammal when the arthropod attempts to feed on the
blood of that creature. The virus thrives within the
new host, sometimes causing illness, sometimes not.
More ticks or mosquitoes are infected with the virus
when they feed on the host’s blood. Eventually, a tick
or mosquito bites a human, and the virus is passed
along. Just a few types of arboviruses cycle only
between arthropods and humans, with no intermediate stop in a bird or small mammal.
Because the arboviruses require an arthropod to
pass them along to humans, the most common times
of year for these illnesses include summer and fall,
when mosquitoes and ticks are most prevalent.
Damp environments favor large populations of mosquitoes, and thus also increase the risk of arbovirus
infections.
The major causes of arbovirus encephalitis
include the members of the viral families alphavirus
(causing Eastern equine encephalitis, Western equine
encephalitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis), flavivirus (responsible for St. Louis encephalitis,
Japanese encephalitis, Tick-borne encephalitis,
Murray Valley encephalitis, Russian spring-summer
encephalitis, and Powassan), and bunyavirus (causing
California encephalitis).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS
Arthropods—A phylum name referring to certain
insects (including mosquitoes and ticks) and spiders.
Encephalitis—A condition in which the brain swells.

In the United States, the most important types of
arbovirus encephalitis include Western equine encephalitis (WEE), Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE),
St. Louis encephalitis, and California encephalitis.
WEE strikes young infants in particular, with a 5%
chance of death from the illness. Of those who survive,
about 60% suffer permanent brain damage. EEE
strikes infants and children, with a 20% chance of
death, and a high rate of permanent brain damage
among survivors. St. Louis encephalitis tends to strike
adults older than 40 years of age, and older patients
tend to have higher rates of death and long-term disability from the infection. California virus primarily
strikes 5-18 year olds, with a lower degree of permanent brain damage.

Causes and symptoms
Encephalitis occurs because specific arboviruses
have biochemical characteristics which cause them to
be particularly attracted to the cells of the brain and the
nerves. The virus causes cell death and inflammation,
with fever and swelling within the brain and nerves. The
membranous coverings of the brain and spinal cord
(the meninges) may also become inflamed, a condition
called meningitis. The brain is swollen, and patches of
bleeding occur throughout the brain and spinal cord.
Patients with encephalitis suffer from headaches,
fever, nausea and vomiting, stiff neck, and sleepiness.
As the disease progresses, more severe symptoms
develop, including tremors, confusion, seizures,
coma, and paralysis. Loss of function occurs when
specific nerve areas are damaged and/or killed.

Diagnosis
Early in the disease, laboratory testing of blood
may reveal the presence of the arbovirus. The usual
technique used to verify the presence of arbovirus
involves injecting the patient’s blood into the brain
of a newborn mouse, then waiting to see if the mouse
develops encephalitis. Diagnosis is usually based on
the patient’s symptoms, history of tick or mosquito
bites, and knowledge that the patient has been in an
area known to harbor the arbovirus.

Treatment
Treatment is mostly supportive, meaning it is
directed at improving the symptoms, but does not
shorten the course of the illness. The main concerns
of treatment involve lowering fever, treating pain,
avoiding dehydration or other chemical imbalances,
and decreasing swelling in the brain with steroids.

Prognosis
Prognosis depends on the particular type of arbovirus causing disease, and on the age and prior health
status of the patient. Death rates range all the way up
to 20% for arbovirus encephalitis, and the rates of
lifelong effects due to brain damage reach 60% for
some types of arboviruses.

Prevention
Prevention involves avoiding contact with
arthropods which carry these viruses. This means
wearing appropriate insect repellents, and dressing
properly in areas known to be infested. Insecticides
and the avoidance of collections of standing water
(which are good breeding ground for arthropods) is
also effective at decreasing arthropod populations.

Description
Origins
Aromatic plants have been employed for their
healing, preservative, and pleasurable qualities
throughout recorded history in both the East and
West. As early as 1500 B.C. the ancient Egyptians
used waters, oils, incense, resins, and ointments
scented with botanicals for their religious ceremonies.
There is evidence that the Chinese may have
recognized the benefits of herbal and aromatic remedies much earlier than this. The oldest known herbal
text, Shen Nung’s Pen Ts’ao (c. 2700-3000 B.C.) catalogs over 200 botanicals. Ayurveda, a practice of traditional Indian medicine that dates back over 2,500
years, also used aromatic herbs for treatment.
The Romans were well-known for their use of
fragrances. They bathed with botanicals and integrated
them into their state and religious rituals. So did the
Greeks, with a growing awareness of the medicinal
properties of herbs, as well. Greek physician and surgeon Pedanios Dioscorides, whose renown herbal text
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

De Materia Medica (60 A.D.) was the standard textbook
for Western medicine for 1,500 years, wrote extensively
on the medicinal value of botanical aromatics. The
Medica contained detailed information on over 500
plants and 4,740 separate medicinal uses for them,
including an entire section on aromatics.
Written records of herbal distillation are found as
early as the first century A.D., and around 1000 A.D.,
the noted Arab physician and naturalist Avicenna
described the distillation of rose oil from rose petals,
and the medicinal properties of essential oils in his
writings. However, it wasn’t until 1937, when French
chemist
René-Maurice
Gattefossé
published
Aromatherapie: Les Huiles essentielles, hormones ve´ge´
tales, that aromatherapie, or aromatherapy, was
introduced in Europe as a medical discipline.
Gattefossé, who was employed by a French perfumeur, discovered the healing properties of lavender
oil quite by accident when he suffered a severe burn
while working and used the closest available liquid,
lavender oil, to soak it in.
In the late 20th century, French physician Jean
Valnet used botanical aromatics as a front line

wrote about his use of essential oils and their healing
and antiseptic properties, in his 1964 book
Aromatherapie, traitement des maladies par les essences
des plantes, which popularized the use of essential oils
for medical and psychiatric treatment throughout
France. Later, French biochemist Mauguerite Maury
popularized the cosmetic benefits of essential oils, and
in 1977 Robert Tisserand wrote the first English language book on the subject, The Art of Aromatherapy,
which introduced massage as an adjunct treatment to
aromatherapy and sparked its popularity in the
United Kingdom.
In aromatherapy, essential oils are carefully
selected for their medicinal properties. As essential oils
are absorbed into the bloodstream through application
to the skin or inhalation, their active components trigger certain pharmalogical effects (e.g., pain relief ).
In addition to physical benefits, aromatherapy
has strong psychological benefits. The volatility of an
oil, or the speed at which it evaporates in open air, is
thought to be linked to the specific psychological effect
of an oil. As a rule of thumb, oils that evaporate
quickly are considered emotionally uplifting, while
slowly-evaporating oils are thought to have a calming
effect.
Essential oils commonly used in aromatherapy
treatment include:


Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobilis). An antiinflammatory and analgesic. Useful in treating otitis
media (earache), skin conditions, menstrual pains,
and depression.

Essential oils contain active agents that can have

the guidance of an aromatherapist, herbalist, massage
therapist, nurse, or physician.

almond, grapeseed, hazelnut, apricot seed, or peach
kernel, may be absorbed more easily by the skin.
Standard dilutions of essential oils in carrier oils
range from 2–10%. However, some oils can be used
at higher concentrations, and others should be diluted
further for safe and effective use. The type of carrier
oil used and the therapeutic use of the application
may also influence how the essential oil is mixed.
Individuals should seek guidance from a healthcare
professional and/or aromatherapist when diluting
essential oils.
Massage is a common therapeutic technique
used in conjunction with aromatherapy to both
relax the body and thoroughly administer the essential oil treatment. Essential oils can also be used in
hot or cold compresses and soaks to treat muscle
aches and pains (e.g., lavender and ginger). As a
sore throat remedy, antiseptic and soothing essential
oils (e.g., tea tree and sage) can be thoroughly
mixed with water and used as a gargle or
mouthwash.

Inhalation
The most basic method of administering aromatherapy is direct or indirect inhalation of essential
oils. Several drops of an essential oil can be applied
to a tissue or handkerchief and gently inhaled. A
small amount of essential oil can also be added to a
bowl of hot water and used as a steam treatment.
This technique is recommended when aromatherapy
is used to treat respiratory and/or skin conditions.
Aromatherapy steam devices are also available commercially. A warm bath containing essential oils can
have the same effect as steam aromatherapy, with
the added benefit of promoting relaxation. When
used in a bath, water should be lukewarm rather
than hot to slow the evaporation of the oil.
Essential oil diffusers, vaporizers, and light bulb
rings can be used to disperse essential oils over a large
area. These devices can be particularly effective in
aromatherapy that uses essential oils to promote a
healthier home environment. For example, eucalyptus
and tea tree oil are known for their antiseptic qualities
and are frequently used to disinfect sickrooms, and
citronella and geranium can be useful in repelling
insects.
Direct application
Because of their potency, essential oils are diluted
in a carrier oil or lotion before being applied to the
skin to prevent an allergic skin reaction. The carrier oil
can be a vegetable or olive based one, such as wheat
germ or avocado. Light oils, such as safflower, sweet

Internal use
Some essential oils can be administered internally
in tincture, infusion, or suppository form to treat certain symptoms or conditions; however, this treatment
should never be self-administered. Essential oils
should only be taken internally under the supervision
of a qualified healthcare professional.
As non-prescription botanical preparations, the
essential oils used in aromatherapy are typically not
paid for by health insurance. The self-administered
nature of the therapy controls costs to some degree.
Aromatherapy treatment sessions from a professional aromatherapist are not covered by health
insurance in most cases, although aromatherapy performed in conjunction with physical therapy, nursing, therapeutic massage, or other covered medical
services may be. Individuals should check with their
insurance provider to find out about their specific
coverage.
The adage ‘‘You get what you pay for’’ usually
applies when purchasing essential oils, as bargain oils
are often adulterated, diluted, or synthetic. Pure essential oils can be expensive; and the cost of an oil will
vary depending on its quality and availability.

Preparations
The method of extracting an essential oil varies by
plant type. Common methods include water or steam
distillation and cold pressing. Quality essential oils

should be unadulterated and extracted from pure
botanicals. Many aromatherapy oils on the market
are synthetic and/or diluted, contain solvents, or are
extracted from botanicals grown with pesticides or
herbicides. To ensure best results, essential oils should
be made from pure organic botanicals and labeled by
their full botanical name. Oils should always be stored
dark bottles out of direct light.
Before using essential oils on the skin, individuals should perform a skin patch test by applying
a small amount of the diluted oil behind the wrist
and covering it with a bandage or cloth for up to
12 hours. If redness or irritation occurs, the oil
should be diluted further and a second skin test
performed, or it should be avoided altogether.
Individuals should never apply undiluted essential
oils to the skin unless advised to do so by a trained
healthcare professional.

Precautions
Individuals should only take essential oils
internally under the guidance and close supervision
of a health-care professional. Some oils, such as
eucalyptus, wormwood, and sage, should never be
taken internally. Many essential oils are highly
toxic and should never be used at all in aromatherapy. These include (but are not limited to) bitter
almond, pennyroyal, mustard, sassafras, rue, and
mugwort.
Citrus-based essential oils, including bitter and
sweet orange, lime, lemon, grapefruit, and tangerine,
are phototoxic, and exposure to direct sunlight should
be avoided for at least four hours after their
application.
Other essential oils, such as cinnamon leaf,
black pepper, juniper, lemon, white camphor,
eucalyptus blue gum, ginger, peppermint, pine
needle, and thyme can be extremely irritating to
the skin if applied in high enough concentration
or without a carrier oil or lotion. Caution should
always be exercised when applying essential oils
topically. Individuals should never apply undiluted essential oils to the skin unless directed to
do so by a trained healthcare professional and/or
aromatherapist.
Individuals taking homeopathic remedies should
avoid black pepper, camphor, eucalyptus, and peppermint essential oils. These oils may act as a remedy
antidote to the homeopathic treatment.
Children should only receive aromatherapy treatment under the guidance of a trained aromatherapist
396

or healthcare professional. Some essential oils may not
be appropriate for treating children, or may require
additional dilution before use on children.
Certain essential oils should not be used by pregnant or nursing women or by people with specific illnesses or physical conditions. Individuals suffering
from any chronic or acute health condition should
inform their healthcare provider before starting treatment with any essential oil.
Asthmatic individuals should not use steam inhalation for aromatherapy, as it can aggravate their
condition.
Essential oils are flammable, and should be kept
away from heat sources.

Side effects
Side effects vary by the type of essential oil used.
Citrus-based essential oils can cause heightened sensitivity to sunlight. Essential oils may also cause contact
dermatitis, an allergic reaction characterized by redness and irritation. Anyone experiencing an allergic
reaction to an essential oil should discontinue its use
and contact their healthcare professional for further
guidance. Individuals should do a small skin patch test
with new essential oils before using them extensively
(see ‘‘Preparations’’ above).

Research and general acceptance
The antiseptic and bactericidal qualities of some
essential oils (such as tea tree and peppermint) and
their value in fighting infection has been detailed
extensively in both ancient and modern medical
literature.
Recent research in mainstream medical literature
has also shown that aromatherapy has a positive
psychological impact on patients, as well. Several
clinical studies involving both post-operative and
chronically ill subjects showed that massage with
essential oils can be helpful in improving emotional
well-being, and consequently, promoting the healing
process.
Today, the use of holistic aromatherapy is widely
accepted in Europe, particularly in Great Britain,
where it is commonly used in conjunction with massage as both a psychological and physiological healing
tool. In the United States, where aromatherapy is
often misunderstood as solely a cosmetic treatment,
the mainstream medical community has been slower
to accept it.

Bradycardia—A slow heart rate. Bradycardia is one
of the two types of arrhythmia
Electrocardiogram—A test which uses electric sensors placed on the body to monitor the heartbeat.
Electrophysiology study—A test using cardiac
catheterization to stimulate an electrical current
to provoke an arrhythmia. The test identifies the
origin of arrhythmias and is used to test the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic drugs.
Tachycardia—A fast heart rate. Tachycardia is one
of the two types of arrhythmia.

I Arrhythmias
Definition
An arrhythmia is an abnormality in the heart’s
rhythm, or heartbeat pattern. The heartbeat can be
too slow, too fast, have extra beats, skip a beat, or
otherwise beat irregularly.

Description

Slow heart rates (less than 60 beats per minute) are
called bradycardias, while fast heart rates (more than
100 beats per minute) are called tachycardias.
Bradycardia can result in poor circulation of blood,
and, hence, a lack of oxygen throughout the body,
especially the brain. Tachycardias also can compromise the heart’s ability to pump effectively because the
ventricles do not have enough time to completely fill.

Arrhythmias are deviations from the normal
cadence of the heartbeat, which cause the heart to
pump improperly. The normal heartbeat starts in the
right atrium, where the heart’s natural pacemaker (the
sinus node) sends an electrical signal to the center of
the heart to the atrioventricular node. The atrioventricular node then sends signals into the main pumping
chamber to make the ventricle contract. Arrhythmias
occur when the heartbeat starts in a part of the heart
other than the sinus node, an abnormal rate or rhythm
develops in the sinus node, or a heart conduction
‘‘block’’ prevents the electrical signal from traveling
down the normal pathway.

Arrhythmias are characterized by their site of
origin: the atria or the ventricles. Supraventricular
arrhythmias occur in the upper areas of the heart and
are less serious than ventricular arrhythmias.
Ventricular fibrillation is the most serious arrhythmia
and is fatal unless medical help is immediate.

More than four million Americans have arrhythmias, most of which are harmless. Middle-aged
adults commonly experience arrhythmias. As people
age, the probability of experiencing an arrhythmia
increases. Arrhythmias often occur in people who
do not have heart disease. In people with heart disease, it is usually the heart disease which is dangerous, not the arrhythmia. Arrhythmias often occur
during and after heart attacks. Some types of
arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, are
serious and even life threatening. In the United
States, arrhythmias are the primary cause of sudden
cardiac death, accounting for more than 350,000
deaths each year.

Symptoms of an arrhythmia include a fast heartbeat, pounding or fluttering chest sensations, skipping
a heartbeat, ‘‘flip-flops,’’ dizziness, faintness, shortness
of breath, and chest pains.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Causes and symptoms
In many cases, the cause of an arrhythmia is
unknown. Known causes of arrhythmias include
heart disease, stress, caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, diet
pills, and decongestants in cough and cold medicines.

Diagnosis
Examination with a stethoscope, electrocardiograms, and electrophysiologic studies is used to diagnose arrhythmias. Sometimes arrhythmias can be
identified by listening to the patient’s heart through
a stethoscope, but, since arrhythmias are not always
present, they may not occur during the physical
exam.

Arrhythmias

Resources

Arrhythmias

An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart’s
activity and may reveal a lack of oxygen from poor
circulation (ischemia). Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on the patient’s chest, arms,
and legs. They send impulses of the heart’s activity
through an electrical activity monitor (oscilloscope)
to a recorder that traces them on paper. The test
takes about 10 minutes and is performed in a physician’s office. Another type of ECG, commonly known
as the exercise stress test, measures how the heart and
blood vessels respond to exertion while the patient is
exercising on a treadmill or a stationary bike. This test
is performed in a physician’s office or an exercise
laboratory and takes 15-30 minutes. Other types of
ECGs include 24-hour ECG monitoring and transtelephonic monitoring. In 24-hour ECG (Holter)
monitoring, the patient wears a small, portable tape
recorder connected to disks on his/her chest that
record the heart’s rhythm during daily activities.
Transtelephonic monitoring can identify arrhythmias
that occur infrequently. Similar to Holter monitoring,
transtelephonic monitoring can continue for days or
weeks, and it enables patients to send the ECG via
telephone to a monitoring station when an arrhythmia
is felt, or the patient can store the information in the
recorder and transmit it later.
Electrophysiologic studies are invasive procedures performed in a hospital to identify the origin of
serious arrhythmias and responses to various treatments. They involve cardiac catheterization, in which
catheters tipped with electrodes are passed from a vein
in the arm or leg through the blood vessels into the
heart. The electrodes record impulses in the heart,
highlighting where the arrhythmia starts. During the
procedure, physicians can test the effects of various
drugs by provoking an arrhythmia through the electrodes and trying different drugs. The procedure takes
one to three hours, during which the patient is awake
but mildly sedated. Local anesthetic is injected at the
catheter insertion sites.

Treatment
Many arrhythmias do not require any treatment.
For serious arrhythmias, treating the underlying heart
disease sometimes controls the arrhythmia. In some
cases, the arrhythmia itself is treated with drugs, electrical shock (cardioversion), automatic implantable
defibrillators, artificial pacemakers, catheter ablation,
or surgery. Supraventricular arrhythmias often can be
treated with drug therapy. Ventricular arrhythmias
are more complex to treat.
Drug therapy can manage many arrhythmias, but
finding the right drug and dose requires care and can
398

take some time. Common drugs for suppressing
arrhythmias include beta-blockers, calcium channel
blockers, quinidine, digitalis preparations, and procainamide. Because of their potential serious side effects,
stronger, desensitizing drugs are used only to treat lifethreatening arrhythmias. All of the drugs used to treat
arrhythmias have possible side effects, ranging from
mild complications with beta-blockers and calcium
channel blockers to more serious effects of desensitizing drugs that can, paradoxically, cause arrhythmias
or make them worse. Response to drugs is usually
measured by ECG, Holter monitor, or electrophysiologic study.
In emergency situations, cardioversion or defibrillation (the application of an electrical shock to the
chest wall) is used. Cardioversion restores the heart
to its normal rhythm. It is followed by drug therapy to
prevent recurrence of the arrhythmia.
Artificial pacemakers that send electrical signals
to make the heart beat properly can be implanted
under the skin during a simple operation. Leads from
the pacemaker are anchored to the right side of the
heart. Pacemakers are used to correct bradycardia and
are sometimes used after surgical or catheter ablation.
Automatic implantable defibrillators correct lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmias by recognizing
them and then restoring a normal heart rhythm by
pacing the heart or giving it an electric shock. They
are implanted within the chest wall without major
surgery and store information for future evaluation
by physicians. Automatic implantable defibrillators
have proven to be more effective in saving lives than
drugs alone. They often are used in conjunction with
drug therapy.
Ablation, a procedure to alter or remove the
heart tissue causing the arrhythmia in order to prevent a recurrence, can be performed through a catheter or surgery. Supraventricular tachycardia can be
treated successfully with ablation. Catheter ablation
is performed in a catheterization laboratory with the
patient under sedation. A catheter equipped with a
device that maps the heart’s electrical pathways is
inserted into a vein and is threaded into the heart.
High-frequency radio waves are then used to remove
the pathway(s) causing the arrhythmia. Surgical
ablation is similar in principle but it is performed in
a hospital, using a cold probe instead of radio waves
to destroy tissue. Ablation treatments are used when
medications fail.
Maze surgery treats atrial fibrillation by making
multiple incisions through the atrium to allow electrical impulses to move effectively. This is often
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Art therapy

recommended for patients who have not responded to
drugs or cardioversion.

I Art therapy
Definition

Alternative treatment
Since some arrhythmias can be life threatening, a
conventional medical doctor should always be consulted first. Acupuncture can correct an insignificant
number (1.5%) of atrial fibrillation cases. For new,
minor arrhythmias, acupuncture may be effective in
up to 70% of cases, but this figure may not differ
much from placebo therapy. Both western and
Chinese herbal remedies are also used in the treatment of arrhythmias. Since hawthorn (Crataegus laevigata) dilates the blood vessels and stimulates the
heart muscle, it may help to stabilize arrhythmias. It
is gentle and appropriate for home use, unlike foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), an herb whose action on
the heart is too potent for use without supervision by
a qualified practitioner. Homeopathic practitioners
may prescribe remedies such as Lachesis and aconite
or monkshood (Aconitum napellus) to treat mild
arrhythmias.

Art therapy, sometimes called creative arts therapy or expressive arts therapy, encourages people to
express and understand emotions through artistic
expression and through the creative process.

Purpose
Art therapy provides the client-artist with critical
insight into emotions, thoughts, and feelings. Key
benefits of the art therapy process include:


Self-discovery. At its most successful, art therapy
triggers an emotional catharsis.



Personal fulfillment. The creation of a tangible
reward can build confidence and nurture feelings of
self-worth. Personal fulfillment comes from both the
creative and the analytical components of the artistic
process.



Empowerment. Art therapy can help people visually
express emotions and fears that they cannot express
through conventional means, and can give them
some sense of control over these feelings.



Relaxation and stress relief. Chronic stress can be
harmful to both mind and body. Stress can weaken
and damage the immune system, can cause insomnia
and depression, and can trigger circulatory problems
(like high blood pressure and irregular heartbeats).
When used alone or in combination with other
relaxation techniques such as guided imagery, art
therapy can effectively relieve stress.



Symptom relief and physical rehabilitation. Art therapy can also help patients cope with pain. This
therapy can promote physiological healing when
patients identify and work through anger, resentment, and other emotional stressors. It is often
prescribed to accompany pain control therapy for
chronically and terminally ill patients.

Prognosis
Advances in diagnostic techniques, new drugs,
and medical technology have extended the lives of
many patients with serious arrhythmias. Diagnostic
techniques enable physicians to accurately identify
arrhythmias, while new drugs, advances in pacemaker
technology, the development of implantable defibrillators, and progress in ablative techniques offer effective treatments for many types of arrhythmia.

Prevention
Some arrhythmias can be prevented by managing
stress, controlling anxiety, and avoiding caffeine, alcohol, decongestants, cocaine, and cigarettes.

Buddhist mandala and Native American sand painting are considered powerful healing tools.
In the late nineteenth century, French psychiatrists Ambrose Tardieu and Paul-Max Simon both
published studies on the similar characteristics of and
symbolism in the artwork of the mentally ill. Tardieu
and Simon viewed art therapy as an effective diagnostic tool to identify specific types of mental illness or
traumatic events. Later, psychologists would use this
diagnostic aspect to develop psychological drawing
tests (the Draw-A-Man test, the Draw-A-Person
Questionnaire [DAP.Q]) and projective personality
tests involving visual symbol recognition (e.g., the
Rorschach Inkblot Test, the Thematic Apperception
Test [TAT], and the Holtzman Inkblot Test [HIT]).
The growing popularity of milieu therapies at
psychiatric institutions in the twentieth century was
an important factor in the development of art therapy
in the United States. Milieu therapies (or environmental therapy) focus on putting the patient in a controlled
therapeutic social setting that provides the patient
with opportunities to gain self-confidence and interact
with peers in a positive way. Activities that encourage
self-discovery and empowerment such as art, music,
dance, and writing are important components of this
approach.
Educator and therapist Margaret Naumburg was
a follower of both Freud and Jung, and incorporated
art into psychotherapy as a means for her patients to
visualize and recognize the unconscious. She founded
the Walden School in 1915, where she used students’
artworks in psychological counseling. She published
extensively on the subject and taught seminars on the
technique at New York University in the 1950s.
Today, she is considered the founder of art therapy
in the United States.
400

In the 1930s, Karl, William, and Charles Menninger
introduced an art therapy program at their Kansasbased psychiatric hospital, the Menninger Clinic. The
Menninger Clinic employed a number of artists in residence in the following years, and the facility was also
considered a leader in the art therapy movement
through the 1950s and 60s. Other noted art therapy
pioneers who emerged in the 50s and 60s include Edith
Kramer, Hanna Yaxa Kwiatkowska (National Institute
of Mental Health), and Janie Rhyne.
Art therapy, sometimes called expressive art or art
psychology, encourages self-discovery and emotional
growth. It is a two part process, involving both the
creation of art and the discovery of its meaning.
Rooted in Freud and Jung’s theories of the subconscious and unconscious, art therapy is based on the
assumption that visual symbols and images are the
most accessible and natural form of communication
to the human experience. Patients are encouraged to
visualize, and then create, the thoughts and emotions
that they cannot talk about. The resulting artwork is
then reviewed and its meaning interpreted by the
patient.
The ‘‘analysis’’ of the artwork produced in art
therapy typically allows patients to gain some level of
insight into their feelings and lets them to work
through these issues in a constructive manner. Art
therapy is typically practiced with individual, group,
or family psychotherapy (talk therapy). While a therapist may provide critical guidance for these activities, a
key feature of effective art therapy is that the patient/
artist, not the therapist, directs the interpretation of
the artwork.
Art therapy can be a particularly useful treatment
tool for children, who frequently have limited language skills. By drawing or using other visual means
to express troublesome feelings, younger patients
can begin to address these issues, even if they cannot
identify or label these emotions with words. Art
therapy is also valuable for adolescents and adults
who are unable or unwilling to talk about thoughts
and feelings.
Beyond its use in mental health treatment, art
therapy is also used with traditional medicine to
treat organic diseases and conditions. The connection between mental and physical health is well
documented, and art therapy can promote healing
by relieving stress and allowing the patient to
develop coping skills.
Art therapy has traditionally centered on visual
mediums, like paintings, sculptures, and drawings.
Some mental healthcare providers have now
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Art therapy is often one part of a psychiatric
inpatient or outpatient treatment program, and can
take place in individual or group therapy sessions.
Group art therapy sessions often take place in
hospital, clinic, shelter, and community program
settings. These group therapy sessions can have
the added benefits of positive social interaction,
empathy, and support from peers. The client-artist
can learn that others have similar concerns and
issues.

Preparations
Before starting art therapy, the therapist may
have an introductory session with the client-artist to
discuss art therapy techniques and give the client the
opportunity to ask questions about the process. The
client-artist’s comfort with the artistic process is critical to successful art therapy.
The therapist ensures that appropriate materials
and space are available for the client-artist, as well as
an adequate amount of time for the session. If the
individual artist is exploring art as therapy without
the guidance of a trained therapist, adequate materials, space, and time are still important factors in a
successful creative experience.
The supplies used in art therapy are limited only
by the artist’s (and/or therapist’s) imagination. Some
of the materials often used include paper, canvas,
poster board, assorted paints, inks, markers, pencils,
charcoals, chalks, fabrics, string, adhesives, clay,
wood, glazes, wire, bendable metals, and natural
items (like shells, leaves, etc.). Providing artists with
a variety of materials in assorted colors and textures
can enhance their interest in the process and may
result in a richer, more diverse exploration of their
emotions in the resulting artwork. Appropriate tools
such as scissors, brushes, erasers, easels, supply trays,
glue guns, smocks or aprons, and cleaning materials
are also essential.
An appropriate workspace should be available for
the creation of art. Ideally, this should be a bright,
quiet, comfortable place, with large tables, counters,
or other suitable surfaces. The space can be as simple
as a kitchen or office table, or as fancy as a specialized
artist’s studio.
The artist should have adequate time to become
comfortable with and explore the creative process.
This is especially true for people who do not consider
themselves ‘‘artists’’ and may be uncomfortable with
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

the concept. If performed in a therapy group or oneon-one session, the art therapist should be available to
answer general questions about materials and/or the
creative process. However, the therapist should be
careful not to influence the creation or interpretation
of the work.

Precautions
Art materials and techniques should match the
age and ability of the client. People with impairments,
such as traumatic brain injury or an organic neurological condition, may have difficulties with the selfdiscovery portion of the art therapy process depending
on their level of functioning. However, they may still
benefit from art therapy through the sensory stimulation it provides and the pleasure they get from artistic
creation.
While art is accessible to all (with or without a
therapist to guide the process), it may be difficult to
tap the full potential of the interpretive part of art
therapy without a therapist to guide the process.
When art therapy is chosen as a therapeutic tool
to cope with a physical condition, it should be
treated as a supplemental therapy and not as a
substitute for conventional medical treatments.

Research and general acceptance
A wide body of literature supports the use of art
therapy in a mental health capacity. And as the mindbody connection between psychological well-being
and physical health is further documented by studies
in the field, art therapy gains greater acceptance by
mainstream medicine as a therapeutic technique for
organic illness.

Arterial embolism

I Arterial embolism

KEY TERMS

Definition

Atrial fibrillation—An arrhythmia; chaotic quivering of the arteries.
Thrombosis—A blockage in a blood vessel that
builds and remains in one place.

An embolus is a blood clot, bit of tissue or
tumor, gas bubble, or other foreign body that circulates in the blood stream until it becomes stuck in
a blood vessel.

Description
When a blood clot develops in an artery and
remains in place, it is called a thrombosis. If all or
part of the blockage breaks away and lodges in
another part of the artery, it is called an embolism.
Blockage of an artery in this manner can be the result
of a blood clot, fat cells, or an air bubble.

Diagnosis
The following tests can be used to confirm the
presence of an arterial embolism:


Electrocardiogram, also known as an EKG or ECG.
For this test, patches that detect electrical impulses
from the heart are attached to the chest and extremities. The information is displayed on a monitor
screen or a paper tape in the form of waves.
Reduced blood and oxygen supply to the heart
shows as a change in the shape of the waves.



Noninvasive vascular tests. These involve measuring
blood pressure in various parts of the body and
comparing the results from each location. When
there is a decrease in blood pressure beyond what is
normal between two points, a blockage is presumed
to be present.



Angiography. In this procedure, a colored liquid
material (a dye, or contrast material) that can be
seen with x rays is injected into the blood stream
through a small tube called a catheter. As the dye
fills the arteries, they are easily seen on x ray motion
pictures. If there is a blockage in the artery, it shows
up as a sudden cut off in the movement of contrast
material. Angiography is an expensive procedure
and does carry some risk. The catheter may cause
a blood clot to form, blocking blood flow. There is
also the risk of poking the catheter through the artery
or heart muscle. Some people may be allergic to the
dye. The risk of any of these injuries occurring is
small.

When an embolus blocks the flow of blood
in an artery, the tissues beyond the plug are
deprived of normal blood flow and oxygen. This
can cause severe damage and even death of the
tissues involved.
Emboli can affect any part of the body. The most
common sites are the legs and feet. When the brain is
affected, it is called a stroke. When the heart is
involved, it is called a heart attack or myocardial
infarction (MI).

Causes and symptoms
A common cause of embolus is when an artery
whose lining has become thickened or damaged,
usually with age, allows cholesterol to build up
more easily than normal on the artery wall. If
some of the cholesterol breaks off, it forms an
embolus. Emboli also commonly form from blood
clots in a heart that has been damaged from heart
attack or when the heart contracts abnormally from
atrial fibrillation.
Other known causes are fat cells that enter the
blood after a major bone fracture, infected blood
cells, cancer cells that enter the blood stream, and
small gas bubbles.
Symptoms of an embolus can begin suddenly or
build slowly over time, depending on the amount of
blocked blood flow.
If the embolus is in an arm or leg, there will be
muscle pain, numbness or tingling, pale skin color,
lower temperature in the limb, and weakness or loss
of muscle function. If it occurs in an internal organ,
there is usually pain and/or loss of the organ’s
function.
402

Treatment
Arterial embolism can be treated with medication
or surgery, depending on the extent and location of the
blockage.
Medication to dissolve the clot is usually given
through a catheter directly into the affected artery. If
the embolus was caused by a blood clot, medications
that thin the blood will help reduce the risk of another
embolism.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

If the condition is severe, a surgeon may elect to
bypass the blocked vessel by grafting a new vessel in its
place.

Prognosis
An arterial embolism is serious and should be
treated promptly to avoid permanent damage to the
affected area. The outcome of any treatment depends
on the location and seriousness of the embolism. New
arterial emboli can form even after successful treatment of the first event.

Prevention
Prevention may include diet changes to reduce
cholesterol levels, medications to thin the blood, and
practicing an active, healthy lifestyle.

Following the release of oxygen in the tissues, the
blood returns to the heart in veins. An arteriovenous
fistula is an abnormal connection of an artery and a
vein. The blood bypasses the capillaries and tissues, and
returns to the heart. Arterial blood has a higher blood
pressure than veins and causes swelling of veins
involved in a fistula. Although both the artery and the
vein retain their normal connections, the new opening
between the two will cause some arterial blood to shunt
into the vein because of the blood pressure difference.

Causes and symptoms
There are two types of arteriovenous fistulas, congenital and acquired. A congenital arteriovenous fistula is one that formed during fetal development. It is a
birth defect. In congenital fistulas, blood vessels of the
lower extremity are more frequently involved than
other areas of the body. Congenital fistulas are not
common. An acquired arteriovenous fistula is one that
develops after a person is born. It usually occurs when
an artery and vein that are side-by-side are damaged
and the healing process results in the two becoming
linked. After catheterizations, arteriovenous fistulas
may occur as a complication of the arterial puncture
in the leg or arm. Fistulas also form without apparent
cause. In the case of patients on hemodialysis, physicians perform surgery to create a fistula. These
patients receive many needle sticks to flush their
blood through dialysis machines and for routine
blood analysis testing. The veins used may scar and
become difficult to use. Surgery is used to connect an
artery and vein so that arterial blood pressure and flow
rate widens the vein and decreases the chance of blood
clots forming inside the vein.
The main symptoms of arteriovenous fistulas near
the surface of the skin are bulging and discolored
veins. In some cases, the bulging veins can be mistaken
for varicose veins. Other fistulas can cause more serious problems depending on their location and the
blood vessels involved.

Diagnosis

Arteriovenous fistula

Definition
An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal channel
or passage between an artery and a vein.

Using a stethoscope, a physician can detect the
sound of a pulse in the affected vein (bruit). The sound
is a distinctive to-and-fro sound. Dye into the blood can
be tracked by x ray to confirm the presence of a fistula.

Treatment
Description
An arteriovenous fistula is a disruption of the normal blood flow pattern. Normally, oxygenated blood
flows to the tissue through arteries and capillaries.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Small arteriovenous fistulas can be corrected by
surgery. Fistulas in the brain or eye are very difficult to
treat. If surgery is not possible or very difficult, injection therapy may be used. Injection therapy is the

injection of substances that cause the blood to clot at
the site of the injection. In the case of an arteriovenous
fistula, the blood clot should stop the passage of blood
from the artery to the vein. Surgery is usually used to
correct acquired fistulas once they are diagnosed.

I Arteriovenous malformations
Definition
Arteriovenous malformations are blood vessel
defects that occur before birth when the fetus is growing in the uterus (prenatal development). The blood
vessels appear as a tangled mass of arteries and veins.
They do not possess the capillary (very fine blood
vessels) bed which normally exists in the common
area where the arteries and veins lie in close proximity
(artery-vein interface). An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) may hemorrhage, or bleed, leading to
serious complications that can be life-threatening.

Description
AVMs represent an abnormal interface between
arteries and veins. Normally, arteries carry oxygenated blood to the body’s tissues through progressively smaller blood vessels. The smallest are
capillaries, which form a web of blood vessels (the
capillary bed) through the body’s tissues. The arterial
blood moves through tissues by these tiny pathways,
exchanging its load of oxygen and nutrients for carbon
dioxide and other waste products produced by the
body cells (cellular wastes). The blood is carried
404

away by progressively larger blood vessels, the veins.
AVMs lack a capillary bed and arterial blood is moved
(shunted) directly from the arteries into the veins.
AVMs can occur anywhere in the body and have
been found in the arms, hands, legs, feet, lungs, heart,
liver, and kidneys. However, 50% of these malformations are located in the brain, brainstem, and spinal
cord. Owing to the possibility of hemorrhaging, such
AVMs carry the risk of stroke, paralysis, and the loss
of speech, memory, or vision. An AVM that hemorrhages can be fatal.
Approximately three of every 100,000 people have
a cerebral AVM and roughly 40-80% of them will
experience some bleeding from the abnormal blood
vessels at some point. The annual risk of an AVM
bleeding is estimated at about 1-4%. After age 55, the
risk of bleeding decreases. Pre-existing high blood pressure or intense physical activity do not seem to be
associated with AVM hemorrhage, but pregnancy and
labor could cause a rupture or breaking open of a blood
vessel. An AVM hemorrhage is not as dangerous as an
aneurysmal rupture. (An aneurysm is a swollen, blood
filled vessel where the pressure of the blood causes the
wall to bulge outward.) There is an approximate 10%
fatality rate associated with AVM hemorrhage, compared to a 50% fatality rate for ruptured aneurysms.
Although AVMs are congenital defects, meaning
a person is born with them, they are rarely discovered
before age 20. A genetic link has been proposed for
some AVMs, but studies are only suggestive, not positive. The majority of AVMs are discovered in people
age 20-40. Medical researchers estimate that the malformations are created during days 45-60 of fetal
development. A second theory suggests that AVMs
are primitive structures that are left over from the

period when fetal blood circulating systems began to
develop.
However they form, AVMs have blood vessels
that are abnormally fragile. The arteries that feed
into the malformation are unusually swollen and thin
walled. They lack the usual amount of smooth muscle
tissue and elastin, a fibrous connective tissue. These
blood vessels commonly accumulate deposits of calcium salts and hyalin. The venous part of the malformation receives blood directly from the artery.
Without the intervening capillary bed, the veins
receive blood at a higher pressure than they were
designed to handle. This part of the malformation is
also swollen (dilated) and thin walled. There is a measurable risk of an aneurysm forming near an AVM,
increasing the threat of hemorrhage, brain damage,
and death. Approximately 10-15% of AVMs are
accompanied by saccular aneurysms, a type of aneurysm that looks like a small sac attached to the outer
wall of the blood vessel.
Although the malformation itself lacks capillaries,
there is often an abnormal proliferation of capillaries
next to the defect. These blood vessels feed into the
malformation, causing it to grow larger in some cases.
As the AVM receives more blood through this ‘‘steal,’’
adjacent brain tissue does not receive enough. These
areas show abnormal nerve cell growth, cell death,
and deposits of calcium in that area (calcification).
Nerve cells within the malformation may demonstrate abnormal growth and are believed to be
nonfunctional.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Most people do not realize that they have an
AVM unless it hemorrhages enough to produce symptoms. Small AVMs are more likely to hemorrhage. If a
hemorrhage occurs, it produces a sudden, severe headache. The headache may be focused in one specific
area or it may be more general. It can be mistaken
for a migraine in some cases. The headache is accompanied by other symptoms, such as vomiting, a stiff
neck, sleepiness, lethargy, confusion, irritability, or
weakness anywhere in the body. Seizures occur in
about a quarter of AVM cases. A person may experience decreased, double, or blurred vision.
Hemorrhaging from an AVM is generally less dangerous than hemorrhaging from an aneurysm, with a
survival rate of 80-90%.
Other symptoms occur less frequently, but sometimes appear alongside major symptoms such as the
sudden severe headache. Additional warning signs of a
bleeding AVM are impaired speech or smell, fainting,
facial paralysis, a drooping eyelid, dizziness, and ringing or buzzing in the ears.
Although large AVMs are less likely to hemorrhage, they can induce symptoms based on their mass
alone. Large AVMs exert pressure against brain tissue,
cause abnormal development in the surrounding brain
tissue, and slow down or block blood flow.
Hydrocephalus, a swelling of brain tissue caused by
accumulated fluids, may develop. The warning signs
associated with a large non-bleeding AVM are similar
to the symptoms of a small malformation that is bleeding. Unexplained headaches, seizures, dizziness, and
neurological symptoms, such as sensory changes, are
signals that demand medical attention.

Diagnosis
Based on the clinical symptoms such as severe
headache and neurological problems, and after a complete neurologic exam, a computed tomography scan
(CT) of the head will be done. In some cases, a
whooshing sound from arteries in the neck or over
the eye or jaw (called a bruit), can be heard with a
stethoscope. The CT scan will reveal whether there has
been bleeding in the brain and can identify AVMs
larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also used to identify an AVM. A lumbar
puncture, or spinal tap, may follow the MRI or CT
scan. A lumbar puncture involves removing a small
amount of cerebrospinal fluid from the lower part of
the spine. Blood cells or blood breakdown products in
the cerebrospinal fluid indicate bleeding.

Arteriovenous malformations

Causes and symptoms

KEY TERMS

Arteriovenous malformations

To pinpoint where the blood is coming from, a
cerebral angiography is done. This procedure uses
x rays to map out the blood vessels in the brain,
including the vessels that feed into the malformation.
The information gained from angiography complements the MRI and helps distinguish the precise
location of the AVM.

Treatment
Neurosurgeons consider several factors before
deciding on a treatment option. There is some debate
over whether or not to treat AVMs that have not
ruptured and are not causing any symptoms. The
risks and benefits of proceeding with treatment need
to be measured on an individual basis, taking into
account factors such as the person’s age and general
health, as well as the AVM’s size and location. Several
treatment options are available, both for symptomatic
or asymptomatic AVMs. These treatment options
may be used alone or in combination.
Surgery
Removing the AVM is the surest way of preventing
it from causing future problems. Both small and large
AVMs can be handled in surgery. Surgery is recommended for superficial AVMs, but may be too dangerous for deep or very large AVMs. Unless it is
an emergency situation, an AVM that has hemorrhaged
is treated conservatively for several weeks. Conservative
treatment consists of managing the immediate symptoms and allowing the patient’s condition to stabilize.
Surgery requires general anesthesia and a longer period
of recuperation than any other treatment option.
Radiation
Radiation is particularly useful to treat small
(under 1 in) malformations that are deep within the
brain. Ionizing radiation is directed at the malformation, destroying the AVM without damaging the surrounding tissue. Radiation treatment is accomplished
in a single session and it is not necessary to open the
skull. However, success can only be measured over
the course of the following two years. A year after
the procedure, 50-75% of treated AVMs are completely blocked; two years after radiation treatment, the
percentage increases to 85-95%.
Embolization
Embolization involves plugging up access to the
malformation. This technique does not require opening the skull to expose the brain and can be used to
406

treat deep AVMs. Using x-ray images as a guide, a
catheter is threaded through the artery in the thigh
(femoral artery) to the affected area. The patient
remains awake during the procedure and medications
can be administered to prevent discomfort. The blood
vessel leading into the AVM is assessed for its importance to the rest of the brain before a balloon or other
blocking agent is inserted via the catheter. The block
chokes off the blood supply to the malformation.
There may be a mild headache or nausea associated
with the procedure, but patients may resume normal
activities after leaving the hospital. At least two to
three embolization procedures are usually necessary
at intervals of two to six weeks. At least a three-day
hospital stay is associated with each embolization.

Prognosis
Approximately 10% of AVM cases are fatal.
Seizures and neurological changes may be permanent
in another 10-30% cases of AVM rupture. If an AVM
bleeds once, it is about 20% likely to bleed again in the
next year. As time passes from the initial hemorrhage,
the risk for further bleeding drops to about 3-4%. If
the AVM has not bled, it is possible, but not guaranteed, that it never will. Untreated AVMs can grow
larger over time and rarely go away by themselves.
Once an AVM is removed and a person has recovered
from the procedure, there should be no further symptoms associated with that malformation.

Arthrography

I Arthrography
Definition
Arthrograpy is a procedure involving multiple
x rays of a joint using a fluoroscope, or a special
piece of x-ray equipment which shows an immediate
x-ray image. A contrast medium (in this case, a contrast iodine solution) injected into the joint area helps
highlight structures of the joint.

Purpose
Frequently, arthrography is ordered to determine
the cause of unexplained joint pain. This fluoroscopic
procedure can show the internal workings of specific
joints and outline soft tissue structures. The procedure
may also be conducted to identify problems with the
ligaments, cartilage, tendons, or the joint capsule of
the hip, shoulder, knee, ankle or wrist. An arthrography procedure may locate cysts in the joint area, evaluate problems with the joint’s arrangement and
function, or indicate the need for joint replacement
(prostheses). The most commonly studied joints are
the knee and shoulder.

Precautions
Patients who are pregnant or may be pregnant
should not have this procedure unless the benefits of
the findings outweigh the risk of radiation exposure.
Patients who are known to be allergic to iodine need to
discuss this complication with their physician. Patients
who have a known allergy to shellfish are more likely
to be allergic to iodine contrast.

Description
Arthrograpy may be referred to as ‘‘joint radiography’’ or ‘‘x rays of the joint.’’ The term arthrogram
may be used interchangeably with arthrography. The
joint area will be cleaned and a local anesthetic
will be injected into the tissues around the joint
to reduce pain. Next, if fluids are present in the
joint, the physician may suction them out (aspirate) with a needle. These fluids may be sent to a
laboratory for further study. Contrast agents are
then injected into the joint through the same location by attaching the aspirating needle to a syringe
containing the contrast medium. The purpose of
contrast agents in x-ray procedures is to help highlight details of areas under study by making them
opaque. Agents for arthrography are generally air
and water-soluble dyes, the most common

containing iodine. Air and iodine may be used
together or independently. After the contrast
agent is administered, the site of injection will be
sealed and the patient may be asked to move the
joint around to distribute the contrast.
Before the contrast medium can be absorbed by
the joint itself, several films will be quickly taken
under the guidance of the fluoroscope. The patient
will be asked to move the joint into a series of
positions, keeping still between positioning.

the area may also be taken. The entire procedure
will last about one hour.

Preparation
It is important to discuss any known sensitivity to
local anesthetics or iodine prior to this procedure. A
physician should explain the procedure and the risks
associated with contrast agents and ask the patient to
sign an informed consent. If iodine contrast will be
administered, the patient may be instructed not to eat
before the exam. The timeframe of fasting may extend
from only 90 minutes prior to the exam up to the night
before. There is no other preparation necessary.

conditions. The entire lining of the joint becomes opaque from the technique, which allows the radiologist
to see abnormalities in the intricate workings of the
joint. In the case of recurrent shoulder dislocations,
arthrography results can be used to evaluate damage.
Patients with hip prostheses may receive arthrography
to evaluate proper placement or function of their
prostheses.

Aftercare
The affected joint should be rested for approximately 12 hours following the procedure. The joint
may be wrapped in an elastic bandage and the patient
should receive instructions on the care and changing of
the bandage. Noises in the joint such as cracking
or clicking are normal for a few days following arthrography. These noises are the result of liquid in the joints.
Swelling may also occur and can be treated with application of ice or cold packs. A mild pain reliever can be
used to lessen pain in the first few days. However, if any
of these symptoms persist for more than a few days,
patients are advised to contact their physician.

Risks
In some patients iodine can cause allergic reactions,
ranging from mild nausea to severe cardiovascular or
nervous system complications. Since the contrast dye is
put into a joint, rather than into a vein, allergic reactions
are rare. Facilities licensed to perform contrast exams
should meet requirements for equipment, supplies and
staff training to handle a possible severe reaction.
Infection or joint damage are possible, although not
frequent, complications of arthrography.

Normal results
A normal arthrography exam will show proper placement of the dye or contrast medium throughout the
joint structures, joint space, cartilage and ligaments.

Abnormal results
The abnormal placement of dye may indicate

I Arthroplasty
Definition
Arthroplasty is surgery to relieve pain and restore
range of motion by realigning or reconstructing a joint.

Purpose
The goal of arthroplasty is to restore the function
of a stiffened joint and relieve pain. Two types of
arthroplastic surgery exist. Joint resection involves
removing a portion of the bone from a stiffened
joint, creating a gap between the bone and the socket,
to improve the range of motion. Scar tissue eventually
fills the gap. Pain is relieved and motion is restored,
but the joint is less stable.
Interpositional reconstruction is surgery to
reshape the joint and add a prosthetic disk between
the two bones forming the joint. The prosthesis can
be made of plastic and metal or from body tissue
such as fascia and skin. When interpositional
reconstruction fails, total joint replacement may be
necessary. Joint replacement is also called total
joint arthroplasty.
In recent years, joint replacement has become the
operation of choice for most knee and hip problems.
Elbow, shoulder, ankle, and finger joints are more
likely to be treated with joint resection or interpositional reconstruction.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Fascia—Thin connective tissue covering or separating the muscles and internal organs of the
body.
Rheumatoid arthritis—A joint disease of
unknown origins that may begin at an early age,
causing deformity and loss of function in the
joints.

Arthroplasty is performed on people suffering
from severe pain and disabling joint stiffness that
result from osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.
Joint resection, rather than joint replacement, is
more likely to be performed on people with rheumatoid arthritis, especially when the elbow joint is
involved. Total joint replacement is usually reserved
for people over the age of 60.

Patients who have undergone arthroplasty must
be careful not to over stress or destabilize the joint.
Physical therapy is begun immediately. Antibiotics are
given to prevent infection.

Risks
Joint resection and interpositional reconstruction
do not always produce successful results, especially in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Repeat surgery or
total joint replacement may be necessary. As with any
major surgery, there is always a risk of an allergic
reaction to anesthesia or that blood clots will break
loose and obstruct the arteries.

Normal results
Most patients recover with improved range of
motion in the joint and relief from pain.

BOOKS

Precautions
If both the bone and socket of a joint are
damaged, joint replacement is usually the preferred
treatment.

Arthroplasty is performed under general or regional anesthesia in a hospital, by an orthopedic surgeon.
Certain medical centers specialize in joint surgery and
tend to have higher success rates than less specialized
centers.
In joint resection, the surgeon makes an incision
at the joint, then carefully removes minimum amount
of bone necessary to allow free motion. The more bone
that remains, the more stable the joint. Ligament
attachments are preserved as much as possible. In
interpositional reconstruction, both bones of the
joint are reshaped, and a disk of material is placed
between the bones to prevent their rubbing together.
Length of hospital stay depends on which joint is
treated, but is normally only a few days.

Preparation
Prior to arthroplasty, all the standard preoperative blood and urine tests are performed. The patient
meets with the anesthesiologist to discuss any
special conditions that affect the administration of
anesthesia.

I Arthroscopic surgery
Definition
Arthroscopic surgery is a procedure to visualize,
diagnose, and treat joint problems. The name is
derived from the Greek words arthron, which means
joint, and skopein, which means to look at.

Purpose
Arthroscopic surgery is used to identify, monitor,
and diagnose joint injuries and disease; or to remove
bone or cartilage or repair tendons or ligaments.
Diagnostic arthroscopic surgery is performed when
medical history, physical exam, x rays, and other
tests such as MRIs or CTs don’t provide a definitive
diagnosis.

Precautions
Diagnostic arthroscopic surgery should not be
performed unless conservative treatment does not fix
the problem.

Description
In arthroscopic surgery, an orthopedic surgeon
uses an arthroscope, a fiber-optic instrument, to see
the inside of a joint. After making an incision about
the size of a buttonhole in the patient’s skin, a sterile
sodium chloride solution is injected to distend the joint.
The arthroscope, an instrument the size of a pencil, is
then inserted into the joint. The arthroscope has a lens
and a lighting system through which the structures
inside the joint are transmitted to a miniature television
camera attached to the end of the arthroscope. The
surgeon uses irrigation and suction to remove blood
and debris from the joint before examining it. Other
incisions may be made in order to see other parts of the
joint or to insert additional instruments. Looking at the
410

interior of the joint on the television screen, the surgeon
can then determine the amount or type of injury and, if
necessary, take a biopsy specimen or repair or correct
the problem. Arthroscopic surgery can be used to
remove floating bits of cartilage and treat minor tears
and other disorders. When the procedure is finished,
the arthroscope is removed and the joint is irrigated.
The site of the incision is bandaged.
Arthroscopic surgery is used to diagnose and treat
joint problems, most commonly in the knee, but also
in the shoulder, elbow, ankle, wrist, and hip. Some of
the most common joint problems seen with an arthroscope are:


inflammation in the knee, shoulder, elbow, wrist, or
ankle



injuries to the shoulder (rotator cuff tendon tears,

Corrective arthroscopic surgery is performed with
instruments that are inserted through additional incisions. Arthritis can sometimes be treated with arthroscopic surgery. Some problems are treated with a
combination of arthroscopic and standard surgery.
Also called arthroscopy, the procedure is performed
in a hospital or outpatient surgical facility. The type of
anesthesia (local, spinal, or general) and the length of
the procedure depends on the joint operated on and the
complexity of the suspected problem. Arthroscopic surgery rarely takes more than an hour. Most patients who
have arthroscopic surgery are released that same day;
some patients stay in the hospital overnight.
Considered the most important orthopedic development in the 20th century, arthroscopic surgery is
widely used. The use of arthroscopic surgery on famous
athletes has been well publicized. It is estimated that
80% of orthopedic surgeons practice arthroscopic surgery. Arthroscopic surgery was initially a diagnostic
tool used prior to open surgery, but as better instruments and techniques were developed, it began to be
used to actually treat a variety of joint problems. New
techniques currently under development are likely to
lead to other joints being treated with arthroscopic
surgery in the future. Recently, lasers were introduced
in arthroscopic surgery and other new energy sources
are being explored. Lasers and electromagnetic radiation can repair rather than resect injuries and may be
more cost effective than instruments.

Preparation
Before the procedure, blood and urine studies and
x rays of the joint will be conducted.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Immediately after the procedure, the patient will
spend several hours in the recovery room. An ice pack
will be put on the joint that was operated on for up to
48 hours after the procedure. Pain medicine, prescription or non-prescription, will be given. The morning
after the surgery, the dressing can be removed and
replaced by adhesive strips. The patient should call
his/her doctor upon experiencing an increase in pain,
swelling, redness, drainage or bleeding at the site of the
surgery, signs of infection (headache, muscle aches,
dizziness, fever), or nausea or vomiting.
It takes several days for the puncture wounds
to heal, and several weeks for the joint to fully recover.
Many patients can resume their daily activities, including going back to work, within a few days of the
procedure. A rehabilitation program, including physical therapy, may be suggested to speed recovery and
improve the future functioning of the joint.

Risks
Complications are rare in arthroscopic surgery,
occurring in less than 1% of patients. These include
infection and inflammation, blood vessel clots, damage
to blood vessels or nerves, and instrument breakage.

by inserting a specifically designed illuminated device
into the joint through a small incision. This instrument
is called an arthroscope. The procedure of arthroscopy
is primarily associated with the process of diagnosis.
However, when actual repair is performed, the procedure is called arthroscopic surgery.

Purpose
Arthroscopy is used primarily by doctors who
specialize in treating disorders of the bones and

Common entry sites for the arthroscope

Arthroscopy is primarily used to help diagnose joint problems. This procedure, most commonly associated with knee and
shoulder problems, allows accurate examination and diagnosis of damaged joint ligaments, surfaces, and other related joint
structures. The illustration above indicates the most common entry sites, or portals, in knee arthroscopy. (Illustration by
Electronic Illustrators Group.)

related structures (orthopedics) to help diagnose
joint problems. Once described as essential for those
who primarily care for athletic injuries, arthroscopy
is now a technique commonly used by orthopedic
surgeons for the treatment of patients of all ages.
This procedure is most commonly used to diagnose
knee and shoulder problems, although the elbow,
hip, wrist, and ankle may also be examined with an
arthroscope.
A joint is a complex system. Within a joint, ligaments attach bones to other bones, tendons attach
muscles to bones, cartilage lines and helps protect the

412

ends of bones, and a special fluid (synovial fluid)
cushions and lubricates the structures. Looking inside
the joint allows the doctors to see exactly which structures are damaged. Arthroscopy also permits earlier
diagnosis of many types of joint problems which had
been difficult to detect in previous years.

Precautions
Most arthroscopic procedures today are performed in same-day surgery centers where the patient
is admitted just before surgery. A few hours following
the procedure, the patient is allowed to return home,

although usually someone else must drive. Depending
on the type of anesthesia used, the patient may be told
not to eat for several hours before arriving. Before the
procedure, the anesthesiologist will ask if the patient
has any known allergies to local or general anesthetics.
Airway obstruction is always possible in any patient
who receives a general anesthesia. Because of this,
oxygen, suction, and monitoring equipment must be
available. The patient’s cardiac status should always
be monitored in the event that any cardiac abnormalities arise during the arthroscopy.

Description
The arthroscope is an instrument used to look
directly into the joint. It contains magnifying lenses
and glass-coated fibers that send concentrated light
into the joint. A camera attached to the arthroscope
allows the surgeon to see a clear image of the joint.
This image is then transferred to a monitor located in
the operating room at the time of the arthroscopy.
This video technology is also important for documentation of the arthroscopic procedure. For example, if the surgeon decides after the arthroscopic
examination that a conventional approach to surgically expose or ‘‘open’’ the joint (arthrotomy) must
be used, a good photographic record will be useful
when the surgeon returns to execute the final surgical
plan.
The procedure requires the surgeon to make several small incisions (portals) through the skin’s surface
into the joint. Through one or two of the portals, a
large-bore needle, called a cannula, is attached to tubing and inserted into the joint. The joint is inflated
with a sterile saline solution to expand the joint and
ensure clear arthroscopic viewing. Often, following a
recent traumatic injury to a joint, the joint’s natural
fluid may be cloudy, making interior viewing of the
joint difficult. In this condition, a constant flow of the
saline solution is necessary. This inflow of saline solution may be through the cannula with the outflow
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

through the arthroscope, or the positions may be
reversed. The arthroscope is placed through one of
the portals to view and evaluate the condition of the
joint.

Preparation
Before an arthroscopy can take place, the surgeon
completes a thorough medical history and evaluation.
Important for the accuracy of this diagnostic
procedure, a medical history and evaluation may discover other disorders of the joint or body parts, proving the procedure unnecessary. This is always
an important preliminary step, because pain can
often be referred to a joint from another area of
the body. Anatomical models and pictures are
useful aids to explain to the patient the proposed
arthroscopy and what the surgeon may be looking at
specifically.
Proper draping of the body part is important to
prevent contamination from instruments used in
arthroscopy, such as the camera, light cords, and
inflow and outflow drains placed in the portals.
Draping packs used in arthroscopy include disposable
paper gowns and drapes with adhesive backing. The
surgeon may also place a tourniquet above the joint to
temporarily block blood flow to the area during the
arthroscopic exam.
General or local anesthesia may be used during
arthroscopy. Local anesthesia is usually used
because it reduces the risk of lung and heart complications and allows the patient to go home sooner.
The local anesthetic may be injected in small
amounts in multiple locations in skin and joint
tissues in a process called infiltration. In other
cases, the anesthetic is injected into the spinal cord
or a main nerve supplying the area. This process is
called a ‘‘block,’’ and it blocks all sensation below
the main trunk of the nerve. For example, a femoral
block anesthetizes the leg from the thigh down (its
name comes from femur, the thighbone). Most
patients are comfortable once the skin, muscles,
and other tissues around the joint are numbed by
the anesthetic; however, some patients are also
given a sedative if they express anxiety about the
procedure. (It’s important for the patient to remain
still during the arthroscopic examination.)
General anesthesia, in which the patient becomes
unconcious, may be used if the procedure may be
unusually complicated or painful. For example,
people who have relatively ‘‘tight’’ joints may be candidates for general anesthesia because the procedure
may take longer and cause more discomfort.

Asbestosis

Aftercare
The portals are closed by small tape strips or
stitches and covered with dressings and a bandage.
The patient spends a short amount of time in the
recovery room after arthroscopy. Most patients can
go home after about an hour in the recovery room.
Pain medication may be prescribed for a short period;
however, many patients find various over-the-counter
pain relievers sufficient.
Following the surgical procedure, the patient
needs to be aware of the signs of infection, which
include redness, warmth, excessive pain, and swelling.
The risk of infection increases if the incisions become
wet too early following surgery. Because of this, it is
good practice to cover the joint with plastic (for example, a plastic bag) while showering after arthroscopy.
The use of crutches is commonplace after arthroscopy, with progression to independent walking on an
‘‘as tolerated’’ basis by the patient. Generally, a rehabilitation program, supervised by a physical therapist,
follows shortly after the arthroscopy to help the
patient regain mobility and strength of the affected
joint and limb.

becomes thickened, forming adhesions. This results in
a stiff and less mobile joint. This problem is frequently
corrected by manipulation and mobilization of the
joint with the patient placed under general anesthesia.

I Asbestosis
Definition
Asbestosis is chronic, progressive inflammation of
the lung. It is not contagious.

Risks
The incidence of complications is low compared
to the high number of arthroscopic procedures performed every year. Possible complications include
infection, swelling, damage to the tissues in the joint,
blood clots in the leg veins (thrombophlebitis), leakage
of blood into the joint (hemarthrosis), blood clots that
move to the lung (pulmonary embolus), and injury to
the nerves around the joint.

Normal results
The goal of arthroscopy is to diagnose a joint
problem causing pain and/or restrictions in normal
joint function. For example, arthroscopy can be a
useful tool in locating a tear in the joint surface of
the knee or locating a torn ligament of the shoulder.
Arthroscopic examination is often followed by arthroscopic surgery performed to repair the problem with
appropriate arthroscopic tools. The final result is to
decrease pain, increase joint mobility, and thereby
improve the overall quality of the patient’s activities
of daily living.

Abnormal results
Less optimal results that may require further treatment include adhesive capsulitis. In this condition, the

Description
Asbestosis is a consequence of prolonged exposure to large quantities of asbestos, a material once
widely used in construction, insulation, and manufacturing. When asbestos is inhaled, fibers penetrate the
breathing passages and irritate, fill, inflame, and scar
lung tissue. In advanced asbestosis,, the lungs shrink,
stiffen, and become honeycombed (riddled with tiny
holes).
Legislation has reduced use of asbestos in the
United States, but workers who handle automobile
brake shoe linings, boiler insulation, ceiling acoustic
tiles, electrical equipment, and fire-resistant materials
are still exposed to the substance. Asbestos is used in
the production of paints and plastics. Significant
amounts can be released into the atmosphere when
old buildings or boats are razed or remodeled.
Asbestosis is most common in men over 40 who
have worked in asbestos-related occupations.
Smokers or heavy drinkers have the greatest risk of
developing this disease. Between 1968 and 1992,
more than 10,000 Americans over the age of 15 died
as a result of asbestosis. Nearly 25% of those who
died lived in California or New Jersey, and most of
them had worked in the construction or shipbuilding
trades.

KEY TERMS
Asbestos—A silicate (containing silica) mineral
that occurs in a variety of forms; it is characterized
by a fibrous structure and resistance to fire.

Causes and symptoms
Occupational exposure is the most common cause
of asbestosis, but the condition also strikes people who
inhale asbestos fiber or who are exposed to waste
products from plants near their homes. Family members can develop the disease as a result of inhaling
particles of asbestos dust that cling to workers’
clothes.
It is rare for asbestosis to develop in anyone who
hasn’t been exposed to large amounts of asbestos on a
regular basis for at least 10 years. Symptoms of the
disease do not usually appear until 15–20 years after
initial exposure to asbestos.
The first symptom of asbestosis is usually shortness of breath following exercise or other physical
activity. The early stages of the disease are also characterized by a dry cough and a generalized feeling of
illness.
As the disease progresses and lung damage
increases, shortness of breath occurs even when
the patient is at rest. Recurrent respiratory infections and coughing up blood are common. So is
swelling of the feet, ankles, or hands. Other symptoms of advanced asbestosis include chest pain,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Screening of at-risk workers can reveal lung
inflammation and lesions characteristic of asbestosis.
Patients’ medical histories can identify occupations,
hobbies, or other situations likely to involve exposure
to asbestos fibers.
X rays can show shadows or spots on the lungs
or an indistinct or shaggy outline of the heart that
suggests the presence of asbestosis. Blood tests are
used to measure concentrations of oxygen and carbon
dioxide. Pulmonary function tests can be used to
assess a patient’s ability to inhale and exhale, and a
computed tomography scan (CT) of the lungs can
show flat, raised patches associated with advanced
asbestosis.

Treatment
The goal of treatment is to help patients breathe
more easily, prevent colds and other respiratory infections, and control complications associated with
advanced disease. Ultrasonic, cool-mist humidifiers
or controlled coughing can loosen bronchial
secretions.
Regular exercise helps maintain and improve lung
capacity. Although temporary bed rest may be recommended, patients are encouraged to resume their regular activities as soon as they can.
Anyone who develops symptoms of asbestosis
should see a family physician or lung disease specialist.
A doctor should be notified if someone who has been
diagnosed with asbestosis:


coughs up blood



continues to lose weight



is short of breath



has chest pain



develops a sudden fever of 1018F (38.38C) or higher



develops unfamiliar, unexplained symptoms

Prognosis
Asbestosis can’t be cured, but its symptoms
can be controlled. Doctors don’t know why the
415

Asbestosis

hoarseness, and restless sleep. Patients who have
asbestosis often have clubbed (widened and thickened) fingers. Other potential complications
include heart failure, collapsed (deflated) lung,
and pleurisy (inflammation of the membrane that
protects the lung).

Ascites

health of some patients deteriorates and the condition of others remain the same, but believe the
difference may be due to varying exposures of
asbestos. People with asbestosis who smoke, particularly those who smoke more than one pack of
cigarettes each day, are at increased risk for developing lung cancer and should be strongly advised
to quit smoking.

Prevention
Workers in asbestosis-related industries should
have regular x rays to determine whether their
lungs are healthy. A person whose lung x ray
shows a shadow should eliminate asbestos exposure even if no symptoms of the condition have
appeared.
Anyone who works with asbestos should wear a
protective mask or a hood with a clean-air supply and
obey recommended procedures to control asbestos
dust. Anyone who is at risk of developing asbestosis
should:


not smoke



be vaccinated against influenza and pneumonia



exercise regularly to maintain cardiopulmonary
fitness



avoid crowds and people who have respiratory
infections

A person who has asbestosis should exercise
regularly, relax, and conserve energy whenever
necessary.

I Ascites
Definition
Ascites is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in
the abdomen.

Description
Rapidly developing (acute) ascites can occur as a
complication of trauma, perforated ulcer, appendicitis, or inflammation of the colon or other tube-shaped
organ (diverticulitis). This condition can also develop
when intestinal fluids, bile, pancreatic juices, or bacteria
invade or inflame the smooth, transparent membrane
that lines the inside of the abdomen (peritoneum).
However, ascites is more often associated with liver
disease and other long-lasting (chronic) conditions.
Types of ascites
Cirrhosis, which is responsible for 80% of all
instances of ascities in the United States, triggers a
series of disease-producing changes that weaken the
kidney’s ability to excrete sodium in the urine.
Pancreatic ascites develops when a cyst that has
thick, fibrous walls (pseudocyst) bursts and permits
pancreatic juices to enter the abdominal cavity.
Chylous ascites has a milky appearance caused by
lymph that has leaked into the abdominal cavity.
Although chylous ascites is sometimes caused by
trauma, abdominal surgery, tuberculosis, or another
peritoneal infection, it is usually a symptom of lymphoma or some other cancer.
Cancer causes 10% of all instances of ascites in the
United States. It is most commonly a consequence of
disease that originates in the peritoneum (peritoneal
carcinomatosis) or of cancer that spreads (metastasizes) from another part of the body.
Endocrine and renal ascites are rare disorders.
Endocrine ascites, sometimes a symptom of an endocrine system disorder, also affects women who are
taking fertility drugs. Renal ascites develops when
blood levels of albumin dip below normal. Albumin
is the major protein in blood plasma. It functions to
keep fluid inside the blood vessels.

Causes and symptoms
Causes
The two most important factors in the production
of ascites due to chronic liver disease are:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Low levels of albumin in the blood that cause a
change in the pressure necessary to prevent fluid
exchange (osmotic pressure). This change in pressure
allows fluid to seep out of the blood vessels.



An increase in the pressure within the branches of
the portal vein that run through liver (portal
hypertension). Portal hypertension is caused by
the scarring that occurs in cirrhosis. Blood that
cannot flow through the liver because of the
increased pressure leaks into the abdomen and
causes ascites.

Other conditions that contribute to ascites development include:

A computed tomography (CT) scan of an axial section
through the abdomen, showing ascites. At right is the liver
occupying much of the abdomen; the stomach and spleen are
also seen. Around these organs is fluid giving rise to this
condition. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by
permission.)



hepatitis



heart or kidney failure



inflammation and fibrous hardening of the sac that
contains the heart (constrictive pericarditis)

Persons who have systemic lupus erythematosus
but do not have liver disease or portal hypertension
occasionally develop ascites. Depressed thyroid
activity sometimes causes pronounced ascites, but
inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) rarely
causes significant accumulations of fluid.
Symptoms

KEY TERMS
Computed tomography scan (CT)—An imaging
technique in which cross-sectional x rays of the
body are compiled to create a three-dimensional
image of the body’s internal structures.

Small amounts of fluid in the abdomen do not
usually produce symptoms. Massive accumulations
may cause:


rapid weight gain



abdominal discomfort and distention

Interferon—A protein formed when cells are
exposed to a virus. Interferon causes other noninfected cells to develop translation inhibitory
protein (TIP). TIP blocks viruses from infecting
new cells.



shortness of breath



swollen ankles

Paracentesis—A procedure in which fluid is
drained from a body cavity by means of a catheter
placed through an incision in the skin.
Systemic lupus erythematosus—An inflammatory
disease that affects many body systems, including
the skin, blood vessels, kidneys, and nervous system. It is characterized, in part, by arthritis, skin
rash, weakness, and fatigue.
Ultrasonography—A test using sound waves to
measure blood flow. Gel is applied to a hand-held
transducer that is pressed against the patient’s
body. Images are displayed on a monitor.

Skin stretches tightly across an abdomen that contains large amounts of fluid. The navel bulges or lies
flat, and the fluid makes a dull sound when the doctor
taps the abdomen. Ascitic fluid may cause the flanks
to bulge.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis

Physical examination generally enables doctors to
distinguish ascities from pregnancy, intestinal gas,
obesity, or ovarian tunors. Ultrasound or computed
tomography scans (CT) can detect even small amounts
of fluid. Laboratory analysis of fluid extracted by
inserting a needle through the abdominal wall (diagnostic paracentesis) can help identify the cause of the
accumulation.
417

Ascites



Aspartate aminotransferase test

Treatment
Reclining minimizes the amount of salt the kidneys absorb, so treatment generally starts with bed rest
and a low-salt diet. Urine-producing drugs (diuretics)
may be prescribed if initial treatment is ineffective.
The weight and urinary output of patients using diuretics must be carefully monitored for signs of :


hypovolemia (massive loss of blood or fluid)



azotemia (abnormally high blood levels of nitrogenbearing materials)



potassium imbalance



high sodium concentration. If the patient consumes
more salt than the kidneys excrete, increased doses of
diuretics should be prescribed

Moderate-to-severe accumulations of fluid are
treated by draining large amounts of fluid (largevolume paracentesis) from the patient’s abdomen.
This procedure is safer than diuretic therapy. It
causes fewer complications and requires a shorter
hospital stay.
Large-volume paracentesis is also the preferred
treatment for massive ascites. Diuretics are sometimes
used to prevent new fluid accumulations, and the procedure may be repeated periodically.

Alternative treatment
Dietary alterations, focused on reducing salt
intake, should be a part of the treatment. In less severe
cases, herbal diuretics like dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) can help eliminate excess fluid and provide
potassium. Potassium-rich foods like low-fat yogurt,
mackerel, cantaloupe, and baked potatoes help balance excess sodium intake.

Prognosis
The prognosis depends upon the condition that is
causing the ascites. Carcinomatous ascites has a very
bad prognosis. However, salt restriction and diuretics
can control ascites caused by liver disease in many cases.
Therapy should also be directed towards the
underlying disease that produces the ascites.
Cirrhosis should be treated by abstinence from alcohol
and appropriate diet. The new interferon agents
maybe helpful in treating chronic hepatitis.

Prevention
Modifying or restricting use of salt can prevent
most cases of recurrent ascites.

I Aspartate aminotransferase test
Definition
The Aspartate aminotransferase test measures
levels of AST, an enzyme released into the blood
when certain organs or tissues, particularly the liver
and heart, are injured. Aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) is also known as serum glutamic oxaloacetic
transaminase (SGOT).

Purpose
The determination of AST levels aids primarily in
the diagnosis of liver disease. In the past, the AST test
was used to diagnose heart attack (myocardial infarction or MI) but more accurate blood tests have largely
replaced it for cardiac purposes.

Description
AST is determined by analysis of a blood sample,
usually from taken from a venipuncture site at the
bend of the elbow.
AST is found in the heart, liver, skeletal muscle,
kidney, pancreas, spleen, lung, red blood cells, and
brain tissue. When disease or injury affects these
tissues, the cells are destroyed and AST is released
into the bloodstream. The amount of AST is directly

Cirrhosis—Disease of the liver caused by chronic
damage to its cells.
Myocardial infarction—Commonly known as a

unremitting chest pain.

related to the number of cells affected by the disease
or injury, but the level of elevation depends on the
length of time that the blood is tested after the
injury. Serum AST levels become elevated eight
hours after cell injury, peak at 24-36 hours, and
return to normal in three to seven days. If the
cellular injury is chronic (ongoing), AST levels will
remain elevated.
One of the most important uses for AST determination has formerly been in the diagnosis of a heart
attack, or MI. AST can assist in determining the
timing and extent of a recent MI, although it is less
specific than creatine phosphokinase (CPK), CKMB,
myglobin, troponins, and lactic dehydrogenase
(LDH). Assuming no further cardiac injury occurs,
the AST level rises within 6-10 hours after an acute
attack, peaks at 12-48 hours, and returns to normal
in three to four days. Myocardial injuries such as
angina (chest pain) or pericarditis (inflammation of
the pericardium, the membrane around the heart) do
not increase AST levels.
AST is also a valuable aid in the diagnosis of liver
disease. Although not specific for liver disease, it can
be used in combination with other enzymes to monitor
the course of various liver disorders. Chronic, silent
hepatitis (hepatitis C) is sometimes the cause of elevated AST. In alcoholic hepatitis, caused by excessive
alcohol ingestion, AST values are usually moderately
elevated; in acute viral hepatitis, AST levels can rise to
over 20 times normal. Acute extrahepatic (outside the
liver) obstruction (e.g. gallstone), produces AST levels
that can quickly rise to 10 times normal, and then
rapidly fall. In cases of cirrhosis, the AST level is
related to the amount of active inflammation of the
liver. Determination of AST also assists in early recognition of toxic hepatitis that results from exposure to
drugs toxic to the liver, like acetaminophen and
cholesterol lowering medications.
Other disorders or diseases in which the AST
determination can be valuable include acute
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

pancreatitis, muscle disease, trauma, severe burn, and
infectious mononucleosis.

Preparation
The physician may require discontinuation of any
drugs that might affect the test. These types include
such drugs as antihypertensives (for treatment of
high blood pressure), coumarin-type anticoagulants
(blood-thinning drugs), digitalis, erythromycin (an
antibiotic), oral contraceptives, and opiates, among
others. The patient may also need to cut back on
strenuous activities temporarily, because exercise can
also elevate AST for a day or two.

Risks
Risks for this test are minimal, but may include
slight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or
feeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma
(blood accumulating under the puncture site).

Normal results
Normal ranges for the AST are laboratoryspecific, but can range from 3-45 units/L (units per
liter).

Abnormal results
Striking elevations of AST (400-4000 units/L) are
found in almost all forms of acute hepatic necrosis,
such as viral hepatitis and carbon tetrachloride poisoning. In alcoholics, even moderate doses of the analgesic
acetaminophen have caused extreme elevations
(1, 960-29, 700 units/L). Moderate rises of AST are
seen in jaundice, cirrhosis, and metastatic carcinoma.
Approximately 80% of patients with infectious mononucleosis show elevations in the range of 100-600
units/L.

Aspergillosis

I Aspergillosis
Definition
Aspergillosis refers to several forms of disease
caused by a fungus in the genus Aspergillus.
Aspergillosis fungal infections can occur in the ear
canal, eyes, nose, sinus cavities, and lungs. In some
individuals, the infection can even invade bone and the
membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord
(meningitis).

Description
Aspergillosis is primarily an infection of the lungs
caused by the inhalation of airborne spores of the
fungus Aspergillus. Spores are the small particles that
most fungi use to reproduce. Although virtually everyone is exposed to this fungus in their daily environment, it rarely causes disease. When Aspergillus does
cause disease, however, it usually occurs in those
individuals with weakened immune systems (immunocompromised) or who have a history of respiratory
ailments. Because it does not present distinctive symptoms, aspergillosis is generally thought to be underdiagnosed and underreported. Furthermore, many
patients with the more severe forms of aspergillosis
tend to have multiple, complex health problems, such
as AIDS or a blood disorder like leukemia, which can
further complicate diagnosis and treatment.
Once considered particularly rare, the incidence of
reported aspergillosis has risen somewhat with the
development of more sophisticated methods of diagnosis and advances made in other areas of medicine,
such as with the increased use of certain chemotherapeutic and corticosteroid drugs that are extremely
useful in treating various types of cancer but that
decrease the individual’s immune response, making
them more susceptible to other diseases like
aspergillosis.
Our advanced ability to perform tissue and organ
transplants has also increased the number of people
vulnerable to fungal infections. Transplant recipients,
particularly those receiving bone marrow or heart
transplants, are highly susceptible to Aspergillus,
which may be circulating in the hospital air.
Aspergillosis can be a serious, potentially deadly
threat for two primary reasons:

Aspergillosis usually occurs in those individuals who
are already ill or have weakened immune systems,
such as patients who have undergone chemotherapy
for cancer.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

None of the currently available antifungal drugs are
reliably effective against Aspergillus.

Causes and symptoms
Airborne Aspergillus spores enter the body primarily through inhalation but can also lodge in the
ear or eye. Normally functioning immune systems are
generally able to cope without consequent development of aspergillosis.
It is important to make distinctions between the
various forms of aspergillosis, as the treatment and
prognosis varies considerably among types.
Aspergillosis as a diagnosis refers to three general
forms:


Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is
seen in patients with long-standing asthma, particularly in patients taking oral corticosteroids for a long
period of time. This is usually the least serious and
most treatable form.



Aspergilloma refers to the mass formed when fungal
spores settle into or colonize areas of the lung that
have been pitted and scarred as a result of tuberculosis or prior pneumonia. There are several available
treatments, although the success rate varies with each
treatment.



Invasive fungal infection refers to rare cases in which
the fungus spreads throughout the body via the
blood stream and invades other organ systems.
Once established, invasive fungal infections are
extremely difficult to cure and, as a result, the associated death rate is extremely high.

Diagnosis
Aspergillosis can be quite difficult to diagnose
because the symptoms, such as coughing and wheezing,
if present at all, are common to many respiratory
disorders. Furthermore, blood and sputum cultures
are not very helpful. The presence of Aspergillus is
so common, even in asthmatics, that a positive culture
alone is insufficient for a diagnosis. Other, potentially
more useful, screening tools include examining the
sample obtained after repeatedly washing the bronchial
tubes of the lung with water (bronchial lavage), but
examining a tissue sample (biopsy) is the most reliable
diagnostic tool. Researchers are currently attempting
to develop a practical, specific, and rapid blood test
that would confirm Aspergillus infection.
Signs of ABPA include a worsening of bronchial
asthma accompanied by a low-grade fever. Brown flecks
or clumps may be seen in the sputum. Pulmonary
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

function tests may show decreased blood flow, suggesting an obstruction within the lungs. Elevated blood levels
of an antibody produced in response to Aspergillus and
of certain immune system cells may indicate a specific
allergic-type immune system response.
A fungal mass (aspergilloma) in the lung usually
does not produce clear symptoms and is generally diagnosed when seen on chest x rays. However, 70% or
more of patients spit up blood from the lungs (hemoptysis) at least once, and this may become repetitive and
serious. Hemoptysis, then, is another indication that
the patient may be suffering from an aspergilloma.
In patients with lowered immune systems who are
at risk for developing invasive aspergillosis, the physician may use a combination of blood culture with
visual diagnostic techniques, such as computed tomography scans (CT) and radiography, to arrive at a
likely diagnosis.

Treatment
The treatment method selected depends on the
form of aspergillosis. ABPA can usually be treated
with many of the same drugs used to treat asthma,
such as systemic steroids. Long-term therapy may be
required, however, to prevent recurrence. Antifungal
agents are not recommended in the treatment of
ABPA. In cases of aspergilloma, it may become necessary to surgically remove or reduce the size of a fungal
mass, especially if the patient continues to spit up
blood. In aspergillosis cases affecting the nose and
nasal sinuses, surgery may also be required.
In non-ABPA cases, the use of antifungal drugs
may be indicated. In such cases, amphotericin B
(Fungizone) is the first-line therapy. The prescribed
dose will depend on the patient’s condition but usually
begins with a small test dose and then escalates. Less
than one-third of patients are likely to respond to
amphotericin B, and its side effects often limit its use.
For patients who do not respond to oral amphotericin
B, another option is a different formulation of the
same drug called liposomal amphotericin B.
For patients who fail to respond or who cannot
tolerate amphotericin B, another drug called itraconazole (Sporanox), given 400-600 mg daily, has also been
approved. Treatment generally lasts about 3 months.
Giving itraconazole can produce adverse reactions if
prescribed in combination with certain other drugs by
increasing the concentrations of both drugs in the
blood and creating a potentially life-threatening situation. Even antacids can significantly affect itraconazole levels. As a result, drug levels must be continually

Aspergillosis

monitored to ensure that absorption is occurring at
acceptable levels.
Two other methods of treatment are being
studied: direct instillation of an antifungal agent
into the lungs and administration of antifungals
using a nebulizer. Instilling or injecting amphotericin B or itraconazole directly into the lung cavity
or into the fungal ball (aspergilloma) itself has
been helpful in stopping episodes of hemoptysis,
but not in preventing future recurrences.
Furthermore, many patients with aspergillomas
are poor risks for surgery because their lung function is already compromised. As a result, instillation of a fungal agent should only be considered in
those who have significant hempotysis.
A popular method of treating some respiratory
disorders is to add a liquid drug to another carrier liquid
and aerosolize or produce a fine mist that can be inhaled
into the lungs through a device called a nebulizer.
However, this has not yet been shown to improve the
patient’s condition in cases of aspergillosis, possibly
because the drug is not reaching the aspergilloma.
At this point, preventative therapy for aspergillosis is not suggested for susceptible individuals, primarily because overuse of the drugs used to fight fungal
infections may lead to the development of drugresistant aspergillosis against which current antifungal
drugs are no longer effective.

Prognosis
The likelihood of recovery from aspergillosis
depends on any underlying medical conditions, the
patient’s general health, and the specific type of aspergillosis. If the problem is based on an allergic response,
as in ABPA, the patient will likely respond well to
systemic steroids.
Patients who require lung surgery, especially those
who have problems with coughing up blood, have a
mortality rate of about 7-14%, and complications or
recurrence may result in a higher overall death rate.
However, by treating aspergilloma with other, nonsurgical methods, that risk rises to 26%, making surgery a better option in some cases.
Unfortunately, the prognosis for the most serious
form, invasive aspergillosis, is quite poor, largely
because these patients have little resilience due to
their underlying disorders. Death rates have ranged
from about 50% in some studies to as high as 95% for
bone-marrow recipients and patients with AIDS. The
course of the illness can be rapid, resulting in death
within a few months of diagnosis.
422

Prevention
Fungal infection by Aspergillus presents a major
challenge, particularly in the patient with a suppressed
immune system (immunocompromised). Hospitals
and government health agencies continually seek
ways to minimize exposure for hospitalized patients.
Practical suggestions are minimal but include moving
leaf piles away from the house. Unfortunately, overall
avoidance of this fungus is all but impossible because
it is present in the environment virtually everywhere.
Research efforts are being directed at enhancing
patients’ resistance to Aspergillus rather than trying
to eliminate exposure to the fungus. Given the growing number of people with immune disorders or whose
immune systems have been suppressed in the course of
treating another disease, research and clinical trials
for new antifungal agents will be increasingly important in the future.

I Aspirin
Definition
Aspirin is a medicine that relieves pain and reduces
fever.

Purpose
Aspirin is used to relieve many kinds of minor
aches and pains–headaches, toothaches, muscle pain,
menstrual cramps, the joint pain from arthritis, and
aches associated with colds and flu. Some people take
aspirin daily to reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack,
or other heart problems.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS

Aspirin–also known as acetylsalicylic acid–is sold
over the counter and comes in many forms, from the
familiar white tablets to chewing gum and rectal suppositories. Coated, chewable, buffered, and extended
release forms are available. Many other over-thecounter medicine contain aspirin. Alka-Seltzer
Original Effervescent Antacid Pain Reliever, for
example, contains aspirin for pain relief and sodium
bicarbonate to relieve acid indigestion, heartburn, and
sour stomach.

Diuretic—Medicine that increases the amount of
urine produced and relieves excess fluid buildup in
body tissues. Diuretics may be used in treating high
blood pressure, lung disease, premenstrual syndrome, and other conditions.
Inflammation—Pain, redness, swelling, and heat
that usually develop in response to injury or illness.
NSAIDs—Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
Drugs such as ketoprofen and ibuprofen which
relieve pain and reduce inflammation.

Aspirin belongs to a group of drugs called salicylates. Other members of this group include sodium
salicylate, choline salicylate, and magnesium salicylate. These drugs are more expensive and no more
effective than aspirin. However, they are a little easier
on the stomach. Aspirin is quickly absorbed into the
bloodstream and provides quick and relatively longlasting pain relief. Aspirin also reduces inflammation.
Researchers believe these effects come about because
aspirin blocks the production of pain-producing chemicals called prostaglandins.

Polyp—A lump of tissue protruding from the lining
of an organ, such as the nose, bladder, or intestine.
Polyps can sometimes block the passages in which
they are found.
Prostaglandin—A hormonelike chemical produced
in the body. Prostaglandins have a wide variety of
effects, and may be responsible for the production
of some types of pain and inflammation.
Reye’s syndrome—A life-threatening disease that
affects the liver and the brain and sometimes occurs
after a viral infection, such as flu or chickenpox.
Children or teenagers who are given aspirin for flu
or chickenpox are at increased risk of developing
Reye’s syndrome.
Rhinitis—Inflammation of the membranes inside
the nose.

In addition to relieving pain and reducing inflammation, aspirin also lowers fever by acting on the part
of the brain that regulates temperature. The brain then
signals the blood vessels to widen, which allows heat to
leave the body more quickly.

Recommended dosage

Salicylates—A group of drugs that includes aspirin
and related compounds. Salicylates are used to
relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever.

Adults
TO RELIEVE PAIN OR REDUCE FEVER. One to two
tablets every three to four hours, up to six times per day.
TO REDUCE THE RISK OF STROKE. One tablet four
times a day or two tablets twice a day.
TO REDUCE THE RISK OF HEART ATTACK. Check with

a physician for the proper dose and number of times
per week aspirin should, if at all, be taken.
Children
Check with a physician.

Precautions
Aspirin–even children’s aspirin–should never be
given to children or teenagers with flu-like symptoms
or chickenpox. Aspirin can cause Reye’s syndrome, a
life-threatening condition that affects the nervous system and liver. As many as 30% of children and teenagers who develop Reye’s syndrome die. Those who
survive may have permanent brain damage.

Check with a physician before giving aspirin to a
child under 12 years for arthritis, rheumatism, or any
condition that requires long-term use of the drug.
No one should take aspirin for more than 10 days
in a row unless told to do so by a physician. Anyone
with fever should not take aspirin for more than 3 days
without a physician’s consent. Do not to take more
than the recommended daily dosage.
People in the following categories should not use
aspirin without first checking with their physician:

People with a history of asthma, nasal polyps, or
both. These people are more likely to be allergic to
aspirin.



People who are allergic to fenoprofen, ibuprofen,
indomethacin, ketoprofen, meclofenamate sodium,
naproxen, sulindac, tolmetin, or the orange foodcoloring tartrazine. They may also be allergic to
aspirin.

People with AIDS or AIDS-related complex who are
taking AZT (zidovudine). Aspirin can increase the
risk of bleeding in these patients.



People taking certain other drugs (discussed in
Interactions).



People with liver damage or severe kidney failure.

Aspirin should not be taken before surgery, as it
can increase the risk of excessive bleeding. Anyone
who is scheduled for surgery should check with his or
her surgeon to find out how long before surgery to
avoid taking aspirin.
Aspirin can cause stomach irritation. To reduce
the likelihood of that problem, take aspirin with food
or milk or drink a full 8-oz glass of water with it.
Taking coated or buffered aspirin can also help. Be
aware that drinking alcohol can make the stomach
irritation worse.

blood in stools. Less common side effects are rashes,
hives, fever, vision problems, liver damage, thirst, stomach ulcers, and bleeding. People who are allergic to
aspirin or those who have asthma, rhinitis, or polyps in
the nose may have trouble breathing after taking
aspirin.

Interactions
Aspirin may increase, decrease, or change the
effects of many drugs. Aspirin can make drugs such
as methotrexate (Rheumatrex) and valproic acid
(Depakote, Depakene) more toxic. If taken with
blood-thinning drugs, such as warfarin (Coumadin)
and dicumarol, aspirin can increase the risk of
excessive bleeding. Aspirin counteracts the effects
of other drugs, such as angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers, which
lower blood pressure, and medicines used to treat
gout (probenecid and sulfinpyrazone). Blood pressure may drop unexpectedly and cause fainting or
dizziness if aspirin is taken along with nitroglycerin
tablets. Aspirin may also interact with diuretics,
diabetes medicines, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), seizure medications, and
steroids. Anyone who is taking these drugs should
ask his or her physician whether they can safely
take aspirin.

I Asthma
Definition
Asthma is a chronic (long-lasting) inflammatory
disease of the airways. In those susceptible to asthma,
this inflammation causes the airways to narrow periodically. This, in turn, produces wheezing and breathlessness, sometimes to the point where the patient
gasps for air. Obstruction to air flow either stops
spontaneously or responds to a wide range of treatments, but continuing inflammation makes the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Asthma

In normal bronchioles the airway
is open and unobstructed.

During an attack, the bronchioles of an
asthma sufferer are constricted by bands
of muscle around them. They may be
further obstructed by increased mucus
production and tissue inflammation.

airways hyper-responsive to stimuli such as cold air,
exercise, dust mites, pollutants in the air, and even
stress and anxiety.

Description
Between 17 million and 26 million Americans
have asthma, and the number seems to be increasing.
In about 1992, the number with asthma was about
10 million, and had risen 42% from 1982, just 10 years
prior. Not only is asthma becoming more frequent,
but it also is a more severe disease than before, despite
modern drug treatments. Asthma accounts for almost
500,000 hospitalizations, two million emergency
department visits, and 5,000 deaths in the United
States each year.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The changes that take place in the lungs of asthmatic persons makes the airways (the ‘‘breathing
tubes,’’ or bronchi and the smaller bronchioles) hyperreactive to many different types of stimuli that don’t
affect healthy lungs. In an asthma attack, the muscle
tissue in the walls of bronchi go into spasm, and the
cells lining the airways swell and secrete mucus into the
air spaces. Both these actions cause the bronchi to
become narrowed (bronchoconstriction). As a result,
an asthmatic person has to make a much greater effort
to breathe in air and to expel it.
Cells in the bronchial walls, called mast cells,
release certain substances that cause the bronchial
muscle to contract and stimulate mucus formation.
These substances, which include histamine and a

Asthma

Adult-onset asthma

KEY TERMS
Allergen—A foreign substance, such as mites in
house dust or animal dander which, when inhaled,
causes the airways to narrow and produces symptoms of asthma.
Atopy—A state that makes persons more likely to
develop allergic reactions of any type, including
the inflammation and airway narrowing typical of
asthma.
Hypersensitivity—The state where even a tiny
amount of allergen can cause the airways to constrict and bring on an asthmatic attack.
Spirometry—A test using an instrument called a
spirometer that shows how difficult it is for an asthmatic patient to breathe. Used to determine the
severity of asthma and to see how well it is responding to treatment.

group of chemicals called leukotrienes, also bring
white blood cells into the area, which is a key part of
the inflammatory response. Many patients with
asthma are prone to react to such ‘‘foreign’’ substances as pollen, house dust mites, or animal dander;
these are called allergens. On the other hand, asthma
affects many patients who are not allergic in this way.
Asthma usually begins in childhood or adolescence, but it also may first appear during adult years.
While the symptoms may be similar, certain important
aspects of asthma are different in children and adults.
Child-onset asthma
Nearly one-third on the 17 to 26 million
Americans with asthma are children. When asthma
begins in childhood, it often does so in a child who is
likely, for genetic reasons, to become sensitized to
common allergens in the environment (atopic person).
When these children are exposed to house-dust mites,
animal proteins, fungi, or other potential allergens,
they produce a type of antibody that is intended to
engulf and destroy the foreign materials. This has the
effect of making the airway cells sensitive to particular
materials. Further exposure can lead rapidly to an
asthmatic response. This condition of atopy is present
in at least one-third and as many as one-half of the
general population. When an infant or young child
wheezes during viral infections, the presence of allergy
(in the child or a close relative) is a clue that asthma
may well continue throughout childhood.
426

Allergenic materials may also play a role when
adults become asthmatic. Asthma can actually start
at any age and in a wide variety of situations. Many
adults who are not allergic have conditions such as
sinusitis or nasal polyps, or they may be sensitive to
aspirin and related drugs. Another major source of
adult asthma is exposure at work to animal products,
certain forms of plastic, wood dust, or metals.

Causes and symptoms
In most cases, asthma is caused by inhaling an
allergen that sets off the chain of biochemical and
tissue changes leading to airway inflammation,
bronchoconstriction, and wheezing. Because avoiding
(or at least minimizing) exposure is the most effective
way of treating asthma, it is vital to identify which
allergen or irritant is causing symptoms in a particular
patient. Once asthma is present, symptoms can be set
off or made worse if the patient also has rhinitis
(inflammation of the lining of the nose) or sinusitis.
When, for some reason, stomach acid passes back up
the esophagus (acid reflux), this can also make asthma
worse. A viral infection of the respiratory tract can
also inflame an asthmatic reaction. Aspirin and a type
of drug called beta-blockers, often used to treat high
blood pressure, can also worsen the symptoms of
asthma.
The most important inhaled allergens giving rise
to attacks of asthma are:


animal dander



mites in house dust



fungi (molds) that grow indoors



cockroach allergens



pollen



occupational exposure to chemicals, fumes, or particles of industrial materials in the air

Inhaling tobacco smoke, either by smoking or
being near people who are smoking, can irritate the
airways and trigger an asthmatic attack. Air pollutants can have a similar effect. In addition, there are
three important factors that regularly produce attacks
in certain asthmatic patients, and they may sometimes
be the sole cause of symptoms. They are:


inhaling cold air (cold-induced asthma)



exercise-induced asthma (in certain children, asthma
is caused simply by exercising)



stress or a high level of anxiety
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Being short of breath may cause a patient to
become very anxious, sit upright, lean forward, and
use the muscles of the neck and chest wall to help
breathe. The patient may be able to say only a few
words at a time before stopping to take a breath.
Confusion and a bluish tint to the skin are clues
that the oxygen supply is much too low, and that
emergency treatment is needed. In a severe attack
that lasts for some time, some of the air sacs in the
lung may rupture so that air collects within the
chest. This makes it even harder to breathe in
enough air.

Diagnosis
Apart from listening to the patient’s chest, the
examiner should look for maximum chest expansion
while taking in air. Hunched shoulders and contracting neck muscles are other signs of narrowed airways.
Nasal polyps or increased amounts of nasal secretions
are often noted in asthmatic patients. Skin changes,
like atopic dermatitis or eczema, are a tipoff that the
patient has allergic problems.
Inquiring about a family history of asthma or
allergies can be a valuable indicator of asthma. The
diagnosis may be strongly suggested when typical
symptoms and signs are present. A test called spirometry measures how rapidly air is exhaled and how
much is retained in the lungs. Repeating the test after
the patient inhales a drug that widens the air passages
(a bronchodilator) will show whether the airway narrowing is reversible, which is a very typical finding in
asthma. Often patients use a related instrument, called
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

a peak flow meter, to keep track of asthma severity
when at home.
Often, it is difficult to determine what is triggering
asthma attacks. Allergy skin testing may be used,
although an allergic skin response does not always
mean that the allergen being tested is causing the
asthma. Also, the body’s immune system produces
antibody to fight off the allergen, and the amount of
antibody can be measured by a blood test. This will
show how sensitive the patient is to a particular allergen. If the diagnosis is still in doubt, the patient can
inhale a suspect allergen while using a spirometer to
detect airway narrowing. Spirometry can also be
repeated after a bout of exercise if exercise-induced
asthma is a possibility. A chest x ray will help rule
out other disorders.

Treatment
Patients should be periodically examined and
have their lung function measured by spirometry to
make sure that treatment goals are being met. These
goals are to prevent troublesome symptoms, to maintain lung function as close to normal as possible, and
to allow patients to pursue their normal activities
including those requiring exertion. The best drug therapy is that which controls asthmatic symptoms while
causing few or no side-effects.
Drugs
METHYLXANTHINES. The chief methylxanthine
drug is theophylline. It may exert some anti-inflammatory effect, and is especially helpful in controlling
nighttime symptoms of asthma. When, for some reason, a patient cannot use an inhaler to maintain longterm control, sustained-release theophylline is a good
alternative. The blood levels of the drug must be measured periodically, as too high a dose can cause an
abnormal heart rhythm or convulsions.
BETA-RECEPTOR AGONISTS. These drugs, which
are bronchodilators, are the best choice for relieving
sudden attacks of asthma and for preventing attacks
from being triggered by exercise. Some agonists, such
as albuterol, act mainly in lung cells and have little
effect on other organs, such as the heart. These
drugs generally start acting within minutes, but
their effects last only four to six hours. Longer-acting
brochodilators have been developed. They may last
up to 12 hours. Bronchodilators may be taken in pill
or liquid form, but normally are used as inhalers,
which go directly to the lungs and result in fewer
side effects.

427

Asthma

Wheezing is often obvious, but mild asthmatic
attacks may be confirmed when the physician listens
to the patient’s chest with a stethoscope. Besides
wheezing and being short of breath, the patient
may cough and may report a feeling of ‘‘tightness’’
in the chest. Children may have itching on their
back or neck at the start of an attack. Wheezing is
often loudest when the patient breathes out, in an
attempt to expel used air through the narrowed
airways. Some asthmatics are free of symptoms
most of the time but may occasionally be short of
breath for a brief time. Others spend much of their
days (and nights) coughing and wheezing, until
properly treated. Crying or even laughing may
bring on an attack. Severe episodes are often seen
when the patient gets a viral respiratory tract infection or is exposed to a heavy load of an allergen or
irritant. Asthmatic attacks may last only a few minutes or can go on for hours or even days (a condition called status asthmaticus).

Asthma

STEROIDS. These drugs, which resemble natural
body hormones, block inflammation and are extremely effective in relieving symptoms of asthma.
When steroids are taken by inhalation for a long
period, asthma attacks become less frequent as the
airways become less sensitive to allergens. This is
the strongest medicine for asthma, and can control
even severe cases over the long term and maintain
good lung function. Steroids can cause numerous
side-effects, however, including bleeding from the
stomach, loss of calcium from bones, cataracts in
the eye, and a diabetes-like state. Patients using
steroids for lengthy periods may also have problems
with wound healing, may gain weight, and may
suffer mental problems. In children, growth may
be slowed. Besides being inhaled, steroids may be
taken by mouth or injected, to rapidly control
severe asthma.
LEUKOTRIENE MODIFIERS. Leukotriene modifiers

(montelukast and zafirlukast) are a new type of
drug that can be used in place of steroids, for
older children or adults who have a mild degree of
asthma that persists. They work by counteracting
leukotrienes, which are substances released by white
blood cells in the lung that cause the air passages to
constrict and promote mucus secretion. Leukotriene
modifiers also fight off some forms of rhinitis, an
added bonus for people with asthma. However, they
are not proven effective in fighting seasonal
allergies.
OTHER DRUGS. Cromolyn and nedocromil are
anti-inflammatory drugs that are often used as
initial treatment to prevent asthmatic attacks over
the long term in children. They can also prevent
attacks when given before exercise or when exposure to an allergen cannot be avoided. These are
safe drugs but are expensive, and must be taken
regularly even if there are no symptoms. Anti-cholinergic drugs, such as atropine, are useful in controlling severe attacks when added to an inhaled
beta-receptor agonist. They help widen the airways
and suppress mucus production.

If a patient’s asthma is caused by an allergen that
cannot be avoided and it has been difficult to control
symptoms by drugs, immunotherapy may be worth
trying. Typically, increasing amounts of the allergen
are injected over a period of three to five years, so that
the body can build up an effective immune response.
There is a risk that this treatment may itself cause the
airways to become narrowed and bring on an asthmatic attack. Not all experts are enthusiastic about
immunotherapy, although some studies have shown
that it reduces asthmatic symptoms caused by
428

exposure to house-dust mites, ragweed pollen, and
cat dander.
Managing asthmatic attacks
A severe asthma attack should be treated as
quickly as possible. It is most important for a patient
suffering an acute attack to be given extra oxygen.
Rarely, it may be necessary to use a mechanical ventilator to help the patient breathe. A beta-receptor agonist is inhaled repeatedly or continuously. If the
patient does not respond promptly and completely, a
steroid is given. A course of steroid therapy, given
after the attack is over, will make a recurrence less
likely.
Maintaining control
Long-term asthma treatment is based on inhaling
a beta-receptor agonist using a special inhaler that
meters the dose. Patients must be instructed in proper
use of an inhaler to be sure that it will deliver the right
amount of drug. Once asthma has been controlled for
several weeks or months, it is worth trying to cut down
on drug treatment, but this must be done gradually.
The last drug added should be the first to be reduced.
Patients should be seen every one to six months,
depending on the frequency of attacks.
Starting treatment at home, rather than in a hospital, makes for minimal delay and helps the patient to
gain a sense of control over the disease. All patients
should be taught how to monitor their symptoms so
that they will know when an attack is starting, and
those with moderate or severe asthma should know
how to use a flow meter. They should also have a
written ‘‘action plan’’ to follow if symptoms suddenly
become worse, including how to adjust their medication and when to seek medical help. A 2004 report said
that a review of medical studies revealed that patients
with self-management written action plans had fewer
hospitalizations, fewer emergency department visits,
and improved lung function. They also had a 70%
lower mortality rate. If more intense treatment is necessary, it should be continued for several days. Over-thecounter ‘‘remedies’’ should be avoided. When deciding
whether a patient should be hospitalized, the past history of acute attacks, severity of symptoms, current
medication, and whether good support is available at
home all must be taken into account.

Prevention
Minimizing exposure to allergens
There are a number of ways to cut down exposure
to the common allergens and irritants that provoke
asthmatic attacks, or to avoid them altogether:


If the patient is sensitive to a family pet, removing the
animal or at least keeping it out of the bedroom (with
the bedroom door closed), as well as keeping the pet
away from carpets and upholstered furniture and
Removing hair and feathers.



To reduce exposure to house dust mites, removing
wall-to-wall carpeting, keeping humidity down, and
using special pillows and mattress covers. Cutting
down on stuffed toys, and washing them each week
in hot water.



If cockroach allergen is causing asthma attacks, killing the roaches (using poison, traps, or boric acid
rather than chemicals). Taking care not to leave food
or garbage exposed.



Keeping indoor air clean by vacuuming carpets
once or twice a week (with the patient absent),
avoiding using humidifiers. Using air conditioning
during warm weather (so that the windows can be
closed).



Avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke.



Not exercising outside when air pollution levels are
high.



When asthma is related to exposure at work, taking
all precautions, including wearing a mask and, if
necessary, arranging to work in a safer area.

INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. It is especially

important to closely watch the course of asthma in
young patients. Treatment is cut down when possible
and if there is no clear improvement, some other treatment should be tried. If a viral infection leads to severe
asthmatic symptoms, steroids may help. The health
care provider should write out an asthma treatment
plan for the child’s school. Asthmatic children often
need medication at school to control acute symptoms
or to prevent exercise-induced attacks. Proper management will usually allow a child to take part in play
activities. Only as a last resort should activities be

THE ELDERLY. Older persons often have other
types of obstructive lung disease, such as chronic
bronchitis or emphysema. This makes it important
to know to what extent the symptoms are caused
by asthma. Giving steroids for two to three weeks
can help determine this. Side-effects from betareceptor agonist drugs (including a speeding heart
and tremor) may be more common in older
patients. These patients may benefit from receiving
an anti-cholinergic drug, along with the beta-receptor agonist. If theophylline is given, the dose
should be limited, as older patients are less able
to clear this drug from their blood. Steroids should
be avoided, as they often make elderly patients
confused and agitated. Steroids may also further
weaken the bones.

Prognosis
Most patients with asthma respond well when
the best drug or combination of drugs is found, and
they are able to lead relatively normal lives. More
than one-half of affected children stop having
attacks by the time they reach 21 years of age.
Many others have less frequent and less severe
attacks as they grow older. Urgent measures to
control asthma attacks and ongoing treatment to
prevent attacks are equally important. A small minority of patients will have progressively more trouble breathing and run a risk of going into

More than 80% of people with asthma have
rhinitis and recent research emphasizes that treating
rhinitis helps benefit ashtma. Prescription nasal steroids and other methods to control rhinitis (in addition to avoiding known allergens) can help prevent
asthma attacks. It is also important for patients to
keep open communication with physicians to ensure
that the correcnt amount of medication is being
taken.

I Astigmatism

Horizontal line out of focus

Light

Astigmatism corrected by lens

Definition
Astigmatism is the result of an inability of the
cornea to properly focus an image onto the retina.
The result is a blurred image.

Astigmatism can be treated by the use of cylindrical lenses.
The lenses are shaped to counteract the shape of the sections of the cornea that are causing the difficulty. (Illustration
by Electronic Illustrators Group.)

Description
The cornea is the outermost part of the eye. It is a
transparent layer that covers the colored part of the eye
(iris), pupil, and lens. The cornea bends light and helps
to focus it onto the retina where specialized cells (photo
receptors) detect light and transmit nerve impulses via
the optic nerve to the brain where the image is formed.
The cornea is dome shaped. Any incorrect shaping of
the cornea results in an incorrect focusing of the light
that passes through that part of the cornea. The bending
of light is called refraction and focusing problems with
the cornea are called diseases of refraction or refractive
disorders. Astigmatism is an image distortion that
results from an improperly shaped cornea. Usually the
cornea is spherically shaped, like a baseball. However, in
astigmatism the cornea is elliptically shaped, more like a
football. There is a long meridian and a short meridian.
These two meridians generally have a constant curvature and are generally perpendicular to each other
430

(regular astigmatism). Irregular astigmatism may have
more than two meridians of focus and they may not be
908 apart. A point of light, therefore, going through an
astigmatic cornea will have two points of focus, instead
of one nice sharp image on the retina. This will cause the
person to have blurry vision. What the blur looks like
will depend upon the amount and the direction of the
astigmatism. A person with nearsightedness (myopia) or
farsightedness (hyperopia) may see a dot as a blurred
circle. A person with astigmatism may see the same dot
as a blurred oval or frankfurter-shaped blur.
Some cases of astigmatism are caused by problems
in the lens of the eye. Minor variations in the curvature
of the lens can produce minor degrees of astigmatism
(lenticular astigmatism). In these patients, the cornea is
usually normal in shape. Infants, as a group, have the
least amount of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase
during childhood, as the eye is developing.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Meridian—A section of a sphere. For example,
longitude or latitude on the globe. Or, on a clock, a
section going through 12:00-6:00 or 3:00-9:00, etc.
Refraction—The turning or bending of light waves
as the light passes from one medium or layer to
another. In the eye it means the ability of the eye
to bend light so that an image is focused onto the
retina.

Causes and symptoms
The main symptom of astigmatism is blurring.
People can also experience headaches and eyestrain.
Parents can notice that a child may have astigmatism when the child can see some part of a pattern
or picture more clearly than others. For example,
lines going across may seem clearer than lines going
up and down.
Regular astigmatism can be caused by the weight
of the upper eyelid resting on the eyeball creating
distortion, surgical incisions in the cornea, trauma or
scarring to the cornea, the presence of tumors in the
eyelid, or a developmental factor. Irregular astigmatism can be caused by scarring or keratoconus.
Keratoconus is a condition in which the cornea thins
and becomes cone shaped. It usually occurs around
puberty and is more common in women. Although the
causes of keratoconus are unknown, it may be hereditary or a result of chronic eye rubbing, as in people
with allergies. The center of the cone may not be in line
with the center of the cornea. Diabetes can play a role
in the development of astigmatism. High blood sugar
levels can cause shape changes in the lens of the eye.
This process usually occurs slowly and, often, is only
noticed when the diabetic has started treatment to
control their blood sugar. The return to a more normal
blood sugar allows the lens to return to normal and
this change is sometimes noticed by the patient as
farsightedness. Because of this, diabetics should wait
until their blood sugar is under control for at least one
month to allow vision to stabilize before being measured for eyeglasses.

Diagnosis
Patients seek treatment because of blurred vision.
A variety of tests can be used to detect astigmatism
during the eye exam. The patient may be asked to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

describe the astigmatic dial, a series of lines that radiate outward from a center. People with astigmatism
will see some of the lines more clearly than others.
One diagnostic instrument used is the keratometer.
This measures the curvature of the central cornea.
It measures the amount and direction of the curvature.
A corneal topographer can measure a larger area of
the cornea. It can measure the central area and
mid-periphery of the cornea. A keratoscope projects
a series of concentric light rings onto the cornea.
Misshapen areas of the cornea are revealed by noting
areas of the light pattern that do not appear concentric on the cornea. Because these instruments are
measuring the cornea, it is also important to have a
refraction in case the lens is also contributing to the
astigmatism. The refraction measures the optics or
visual status of the eye and the result is the eyeglass
prescription. The refraction is when the patient is looking at an eye chart and the doctor is putting different
lenses in front of the patient’s eyes and asks which one
looks better.

Treatment
Astigmatism can be treated by the use of cylindrical lenses. They can be in eyeglasses or contact lenses.
The unit of measure describing the power of the lens
system or lens is called the diopter (D). The lenses are
shaped to counteract the shape of the sections of
cornea that are causing the difficulty. Because the
correction is in one direction, it is written in terms of
the axis the correction is in. On a prescription, for
example, it may say -1.00  1808. Cylinders correct
astigmatism, minus spheres correct myopia, and plus
spheres correct hyperopia.
There is some debate as to whether people with
very small amounts of astigmatism should be treated.
Generally, if visual acuity is good and the patient
experiences no overt symptoms, treatment is not
necessary. When treating larger amounts of astigmatism, or astigmatism for the first time, the doctor may
not totally correct the astigmatism. The cylindrical
correction in the eyeglasses may make the floor appear
to tilt, thus making it difficult for the patient at first.
Generally, the doctor will place lenses in a trial frame
to allow the patient to try the prescription at the exam.
It may take a week or so to get used to the glasses,
however, if the patient is having a problem they should
contact their doctor, who might want to recheck the
prescription.
Contact lenses that are used to correct astigmatism are called toric lenses. When a person blinks, the
contact lens rotates. In toric lenses, it is important for

the lens to return to the same position each time.
Lenses have thin zones, or cut-off areas (truncated),
or have other ways to rotate and return to the correct
position. Soft toric lenses are available in a variety of
prescriptions, materials, and even in tints. Patients
should ask their doctors about the possibility of toric
lenses.

JUDITH ASTON
Judith Aston was born in Long Beach, California. She
graduated from University of California at Los Angeles
with a B.A. and a M.F.A. in dance. Her interest in movement arose from working as a dancer. In 1963 Aston
established her first movement education program for
dancers, actors, and athletes at Long Beach City College.

In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved laser treatment of astigmatism.
Patients considering this should make sure the surgeon
has a lot of experience in the procedure and discuss the
possible side effects or risks with the doctor. In the
case of keratoconus, a corneal transplant is performed
if the astigmatism can not be corrected with hard
contact lenses.

Five years later, while recovering from injuries sustained during two consecutive automobile accidents,
Aston met Ida Rolf, the developer of Rolfing. Aston
began working for Rolf, teaching a movement education
program called Rolf-Aston Structural Patterning that
emphasized using the body with minimum effort and
maximum precision.
In time, Rolf and Aston’s views on movement diverged,
and the partnership was dissolved in 1977. Aston formed her
own company called the Aston Paradigm Corporation in
Lake Tahoe, California. This company provides training
and certification for Aston practitioners. She also began
exploring how environmental conditions affect body
movement, foreshadowing the ergonomic movement in
the workplace that developed in the 1990s. Over time,
Aston has expanded her movement work to include a
fitness program for older adults. Today, Judith Aston
serves as director of Aston Paradigm Corporation.

Prognosis
Astigmatism is a condition that may be present at
birth. It may also be acquired if something is distorting
the cornea. Vision can generally be corrected with
eyeglasses or contact lenses. The major risks of surgery
(aside from the surgical risks) are over and under
correction of the astigmatism. There is no cure for
over correction. Under correction can be solved by
repeating the operation.

Aston-Patterning is an integrated system of movement education, bodywork, ergonomic adjustments,
and fitness training that recognizes the relationship

by teaching them to improve postural and movement
patterns.

Description
Seeking to solve movement problems, AstonPatterning helps make the most of their own unique
body types rather than trying to force them to conform
to an ideal. Unlike Rolfing, it doesn’t strive for linear
symmetry. Rather it works with asymmetry in the
human body to develop patterns of alignment and
movement that feel right to the individual. Aston
also introduced the idea of working in a three-dimensional spinal pattern. Aston-Patterning sessions have
four general components. They are:

A personal history that helps the practitioner assess
the client’s needs.

Pre-testing, in which the practitioner and the client

release tension and make new movement patterns easier.

Post-testing, when pre-testing movements are
repeated, allowing the client to feel the changes that
have taken place and integrate them into daily life.

Aston-Patterning requires more participation
from the client than many bodywork techniques. The
massage aspect of Aston-Patterning is designed
around a three-dimensional, non-compressive touch
that releases patterns of tension in the body. It is
gentler than Rolfing. Myokinetics uses touch to
release tension in the face and neck. Arthrokinetics
addresses tension at bones and joints. This massage
is accompanied by education about how new movement patterns may be established.
In addition to Aston-Patterning sessions, clients
are also helped to examine their environment for factors, such as seating or sleeping arrangements, that
may limit their body function and introduce tension.
Finally, they may choose to participate in the Aston
fitness training program that includes loosening techniques based on self-massage, toning, stretching, and
cardiovascular fitness.

Preparations
No special preparation need be taken.

Precautions
No special precautions are necessary when
participating.

Side effects
No undesirable side effects are reported. Usually
clients report a diminution of tension, improved body
movement, and an enhanced feeling of well being.

Research and general acceptance
Aston-Patterning is an outgrowth of Rolfing,
which has been shown to be of benefit in a limited
number of controlled studies. Little controlled
research has been done on the either benefits or

I Ataxia-telangiectasia
Definition
Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), also called Louis-Bar
syndrome, is a rare, genetic neurological disorder of
childhood that progressively destroys part of the
motor control area of the brain, leading to a lack of
balance and coordination. A-T also affects the
immune system and increases the risk of leukemia
and lymphoma in affected individuals.

Description
The disorder first appeared in the medical literature in the mid-1920s, but was not named specifically
until 1957. The name is a combination of two recognized abnormalities: ataxia (lack of muscle control)
and telangiectasia (abnormal dilatation of capillary
vessels that often result in tumors and red skin lesions).
However, A-T involves more than just the sum of
these two findings. Other associated A-T problems
include immune system deficiencies, extreme sensitivity to radiation, and blood cancers.
Medical researchers initially suspected that multiple genes (the units responsible for inherited features)
were involved. However, in 1995, mutations in a single
large gene were identified as causing A-T. Researchers
named the gene ATM for A-T, mutated. Subsequent
research revealed that ATM has a significant role in
regulating cell division. The symptoms associated with
A-T reflect the main role of the AT gene, which is to
induce several cellular responses to DNA damage,
such as preventing damaged DNA from being reproduced. When the AT gene is mutated into ATM, the

signaling networks are affected and the cell no longer
responds correctly to minimize the damage.
A-T is very rare, but it occurs in every population world wide, with an estimated frequency of
between 1/40,000 and 1/100,000 live births. But it
is believed that many A-T cases, particularly those
who die at a young age, are never properly diagnosed. Therefore, this disease may actually be
much more prevalent. According to the A-T
Project Foundation, an estimated 1% (2.5 million
in the United States) of the general population
carries defective A-T genes. Carriers of one copy
of this gene do not develop A-T, but have a significantly increased risk of cancer. This makes the
A-T gene one of the most important cancer-related
genes identified to date.

The ATM gene is autosomal recessive, meaning
the disease occurs only if a defective gene is inherited from both parents. Infants with A-T initially

often appear very healthy. At around age two,
ataxia and nervous system abnormalities becomes
apparent. The root cause of A-T-associated ataxia
is cell death in the brain, specifically the large
branching cells of the nervous system (Purkinje’s
cells) which are located in the cerebellum. A toddler becomes clumsy, loses balance easily and lacks
muscle control. Speech becomes slurred and more
difficult, and the symptoms progressively worsen.
Between ages two and eight, telangiectases, or tiny,
red ‘‘spider’’ veins, appear on the cheeks and ears
and in the eyes.
By age 10-12, children with A-T can no longer
control their muscles. Immune system deficiencies
become common, and affected individuals are extremely sensitive to radiation. Immune system deficiencies vary between individuals but include
lower-than-normal levels of proteins that function
as antibodies (immunoglobulins) and white blood
cells (blood cells not containing ‘‘iron’’ proteins).
The thymus gland, which aids in development of
the body’s immune system, is either missing or has
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis
Diagnosis relies on recognizing the hallmarks
of A-T: progressive ataxia and telangiectasia.
However, this may be difficult as ataxia symptoms
do appear prior to telangiectasia symptoms by several years. Other symptoms can vary between individuals; for example, 70% of individuals with A-T
have a high incidence of respiratory infection, 30%
do not. The identification of the ATM gene raises
hopes that screening, and perhaps treatment, may
be possible.

Treatment
There is currently no cure for A-T, and treatment
focuses on managing the individual’s multiple symptoms. Physical therapy and speech therapy can help
the patient adjust to ataxia. Injections of gamma globulin, or extracts of human blood that contain antibodies, are used to strengthen the weakened immune
system. High-dose vitamin administrations may also
be prescribed. Research continues in many countries
to find effective treatments. Individuals and families
living with this disorder may benefit from attending
support groups.

Prognosis
A-T is a fatal condition. Children with A-T
become physically disabled by their early teens and
typically die by their early 20s, usually from the associated blood cancers and malignancies. In very rare
cases, individuals with A-T may experience slower
progression and a slightly longer life span, surviving
into their 30s. A-T carriers have a five-fold higher risk
than non-carriers of developing certain cancers, especially breast cancer.

Prevention
Medical researchers are investigating methods for
screening individuals who may be carriers of the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

defective gene. Prenatal testing for A-T is possible
but not done routinely, because commercial screening
tests have yet to be developed.

Ataxia see Movement disorders

I Atelectasis
Definition
Atelectasis is a collapse of lung tissue affecting
part or all of one lung. This condition prevents normal
oxygen absoption to healthy tissues.

Description
Atelectasis can result from an obstruction (blockage) of the airways that affects tiny air scas called
alveoli. Alveoli are very thin-walled and contain a
rich blood supply. They are important for lung function, since their purpose is the exchange of oxygen and
carbon dioxide. When the airways are blocked by a
mucous ‘‘plug,’’ foreign object, or tumor, the alveoli
are unable to fill with air and collapse of lung tissue
can occur in the affected area. Atelectasis is a potential
complication following surgery, especially in individuals who have undergone chest or abdominal operations resulting in associated abdominal or chest pain
during breathing. Congenital atelectasis can result
from a failure of the lungs to expand at birth. This
congenital condition may be localized or may affect all
of both lungs.

Causes and symptoms
Causes of atelectasis include insufficient attemps
at respiration by the newborn, bronchial obstruction,
or absence of surfactant (a substance secreted by
alveoli that maintains the stability of lung tissue by
reducing the surface tension of fluids that coat the
lung). This lack of surfactant reduces the surface
area available for effective gas exchange causing it to
collapse if severe. Pressure on the lung from fluid or air
can cause atelectasis as well as obstruction of lung air
passages by thick mucus resulting from various infections and lung diseases. Tumors and inhaled objects
can also cause obstruction of the airway, leading to
atelectasis.
Anyone undergoing chest or abdominal surgery
using general anesthesia is at risk to develop atelectasis, since breathing is often shallow after surgery to
435

Atelectasis

developed abnormally. Intelligence is normal, but
growth may be retarded owing to immune system
or hormonal deficiencies. Individuals with A-T are
also sometimes afflicted with diabetes, prematurely
graying hair, and difficulty swallowing. As the children grow older, the immune system becomes
weaker and less capable of fighting infection. In
the later stages, recurrent respiratory infections
and blood cancers, such as leukemia or lymphoma,
are common.

Atelectasis

KEY TERMS
Alveoli—Tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas
exchange takes place between alveolar air and
pulmonary blood within the capillaries
Bronchial—Relating to the air passages to and from
the lungs including the bronchi and the bronchioles.
Bronchoscopy—A procedure in which a hollow,
flexible tube is inserted into the airway to allow
visual examination of the larynx, trachea, bronchi,
and bronchioles. It is also used to collect specimens for
biopsy or culturing and to remove airway obstructions.
Incentive spirometer—A breathing device that
provides feedback on performance to encourage
deep breathing.
Mucus—A thin, slippery film secreted by the
mucous membranes and glands.
A computed tomography (CT) scan through a patient’s chest.

avoid pain from the surgical incision. Any significant
decrease in airflow to the alveoli contributes to pooling of secretions, which in turn can cause infection.
Chest injuries causing shallow breathing, including
fractured ribs, can cause atelectasis. Common symptoms of atelectasis include shortness of breath and
decreased chest wall expansion. If atelectasis only
afects a small area of the lung, symptoms are ususally
minimal. If the condition affects a large area of the
lung and develops quickly, the individual may turn
blue (cyanotic) or pale, have extreme shortness of
breath, and feel a stabbing pain on the affected side.
Fever and increased heart rate may be present if infection accompanies atelectasis.

Diagnosis
To diagnose atelectasis, a doctor starts by recording the patient’s symptoms and performing a thorough physical examination. When the doctor listens
to the lungs through a stethoscope (ausculation),
diminished or bronchial breath sounds may be heard.
By tapping on the chest (percussion) while listening
through the stethoscope, the doctor can often tell if the
lung is collapsed. A chest x ray that shows an airless
area in the lung confirms the diagnosis of atelectasis. If
an obstruction of the airways is suspected, a computed
tomography scan (CT) or bronchoscopy may be
performed to locate the cause of the blockage.
436

Postural drainage—Techniques to help expel excess
mucus by specific poistions of the body (that decrease
the effects of gravity) combined with manual percussion and vibration over various parts of the lung.
Surfactant—A substance secreted by the alveoli in
the lungs that reduces the surface tension of lung
fluids, allowing gas exchange and helping maintain
the elasticity of lung tissue.
Tumor—An abnormal growth of tissue resulting from
uncontrolled, progressive multiplication of cells.

Treatment
If atelectasis is due to obstruction of the airway,
the first step in treatment is to remove the cause of
the blockage. This may be done by coughing, suctioning, or bronchoscopy. If a tumor is the cause of atelectasis, surgery may be necessary to remove it.
Antibiotics are commonly used to fight the infection
that often accompanies atelectasis. In cases where
recurrent or long-lasting infection is disabling or
where significant bleeding occurs, the affected section
of the lung may be surgically removed.

Prognosis
If atelectasis is caused by a thick mucus ‘‘plug’’ or
inhaled foreign object, the patient usually recovers completely when the blockage is removed. If it is caused by a
tumor, the outcome depends on the nature of the tumor
involved. If atelectasis is a result of surgery, other postoperative conditions and/or complications affect the
prognosis.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

When recovering from surgery, frequent repositioning in bed along with coughing and deep breathing are
important. Coughing and breathing deeply every one to
two hours after any surgical operation with general
anesthesia is recommended. Breathing exercises and the
use of breathing devices, such as an incentive spirometer,
may also help prevent atelectasis. Although smokers
have a higher risk of developing atelectasis following
surgery, stopping smoking six to eight weeks before surgery can help reduce the risk. Increasing fluid intake
during respiratory illness or after surgery (by mouth or
intravenously) helps lung secretions to remain loose.
Increasing humidity may also be beneficial.
Postural drainage techniques can be learned from
a respiratory therapist or physical therapist and are a
useful tool for anyone affected with a respiratiory illness that could cause atelectasis. Because foreign
objects blocking the airway can cause atelectasis, it is
very important to keep small objects that might be
inhaled away from young children.

I Atherectomy
Definition
Atherectomy is a non-surgical procedure to open
blocked coronary arteries or vein grafts by using a device
on the end of a catheter to cut or shave away atherosclerotic plaque (a deposit of fat and other substances
that accumulate in the lining of the artery wall).

Purpose
Atherectomy is performed to restore the flow of
oxygen-rich blood to the heart, to relieve chest pain,
and to prevent heart attacks. It may be done on
patients with chest pain who have not responded to
other medical therapy and on certain of those who are
candidates for balloon angioplasty (a surgical procedure in which a balloon catheter is used to flatten
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

plaque against an artery wall) or coronary artery
bypass graft surgery. It is sometimes performed to
remove plaque that has built up after a coronary artery
bypass graft surgery.

Precautions
Atherectomy should not be performed when the
plaque is located where blood vessels divide into
branches, when plaque is angular or inside an angle
of a blood vessel, on patients with weak vessel walls,
on ulcerated or calcium-hardened lesions, or on
blockages through which a guide wire won’t pass.

Description
Atherectomy uses a rotating shaver or other device
placed on the end of a catheter to slice away or destroy
plaque. At the beginning of the procedure, medications
to control blood pressure, dilate the coronary arteries,
and prevent blood clots are administered. The patient is
awake but sedated. The catheter is inserted into an
artery in the groin, leg, or arm, and threaded through
the blood vessels into the blocked coronary artery. The
cutting head is positioned against the plaque and activated, and the plaque is ground up or suctioned out.
The types of atherectomy are rotational, directional, and transluminal extraction. Rotational atherectomy uses a high speed rotating shaver to grind up
plaque. Directional atherectomy was the first type
approved, but is no longer commonly used; it scrapes
plaque into an opening in one side of the catheter.
Transluminal extraction coronary atherectomy uses a
device that cuts plaque off vessel walls and vacuums it
into a bottle. It is used to clear bypass grafts.
Performed in a cardiac catheterization lab, atherectomy is also called removal of plaque from the coronary
arteries. It can be used instead of, or along with, balloon
angioplasty. Atherectomy is successful about 95% of the
time. Plaque forms again in 20-30% of patients.

Preparation
The day before atherectomy, the patient takes
medication to prevent blood clots and may be asked
to bathe and shampoo with an antiseptic skin cleaner.

Aftercare
After the procedure, the patient spends several days
in the hospital’s cardiac monitoring area. For at least
20 minutes, pressure is applied to a dressing on the
insertion site. For the first hour, an electrocardiogram
and close monitoring are conducted; vital signs are

Definition
Atherosclerosis is the build up of a waxy plaque
on the inside of blood vessels. In Greek, athere means
gruel, and skleros means hard. Atherosclerosis is often
called arteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis (from the
Greek arteria, meaning artery) is a general term for
hardening of the arteries. Arteriosclerosis can occur in
several forms, including atherosclerosis.

Description
Atherosclerosis, a progressive process responsible
for most heart disease, is a type of arteriosclerosis
or hardening of the arteries. An artery is made up of
several layers: an inner lining called the endothelium,
an elastic membrane that allows the artery to expand
and contract, a layer of smooth muscle, and a layer of
connective tissue. Arteriosclerosis is a broad term that
includes a hardening of the inner and middle layers of
the artery. It can be caused by normal aging, by high
blood pressure, and by diseases such as diabetes.
Atherosclerosis is a type of arteriosclerosis that affects
only the inner lining of an artery. It is characterized by
plaque deposits that block the flow of blood.
Plaque is made of fatty substances, cholesterol,
waste products from the cells, calcium, and fibrin, a
stringy material that helps clot blood. The plaque formation process stimulates the cells of the artery wall to
produce substances that accumulate in the inner layer.
Fat builds up within these cells and around them, and
they form connective tissue and calcium. The inner
layer of the artery wall thickens, the artery’s diameter
is reduced, and blood flow and oxygen delivery are
decreased. Plaques can rupture or crack open, causing
the sudden formation of a blood clot (thrombosis).
Atherosclerosis can cause a heart attack if it completely
blocks the blood flow in the heart (coronary) arteries. It
can cause a stroke if it completely blocks the brain
(carotid) arteries. Atherosclerosis can also occur in the
arteries of the neck, kidneys, thighs, and arms, causing
kidney failure or gangrene and amputation.

Risk factors that can be changed:


Cigarette/tobacco smoke–Smoking increases both
the chance of developing atherosclerosis and the
chance of dying from coronary heart disease.
Second hand smoke may also increase risk.



High blood cholesterol–Cholesterol, a soft, waxy
substance, comes from foods such as meat, eggs,
and other animal products and is produced in the
liver. Age, sex, heredity, and diet affect cholesterol.
Total blood cholesterol is considered high at levels
above 240 mg/dL and borderline at 200-239 mg/dL.
High-risk levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL
cholesterol) begin at 130-159 mg/dL.



High triglycerides–Most fat in food and in the body
takes the form of triglycerides. Blood triglyceride
levels above 400 mg/dL have been linked to coronary
artery disease in some people. Triglycerides, however, are not nearly as harmful as LDL cholesterol.



High blood pressure–Blood pressure of 140 over 90
or higher makes the heart work harder, and over
time, both weakens the heart and harms the arteries.



Physical inactivity–Lack of exercise increases the
risk of atherosclerosis.



Diabetes mellitus–The risk of developing atherosclerosis is seriously increased for diabetics and can be lowered by keeping diabetes under control. Most diabetics
die from heart attacks caused by atherosclerosis.



Obesity–Excess weight increases the strain on the
heart and increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis even if no other risk factors are present.

Causes and symptoms
Atherosclerosis can begin in the late teens, but it
usually takes decades to cause symptoms. Some people
experience rapidly progressing atherosclerosis during
their thirties, others during their fifties or sixties.
Atherosclerosis is complex. Its exact cause is still
unknown. It is thought that atherosclerosis is caused

Risk factors that cannot be changed:

Heredity–People whose parents have coronary
artery disease, atherosclerosis, or stroke at an early

I Atherosclerosis

by a response to damage to the endothelium from high
cholesterol, high blood pressure, and cigarette smoking.
A person who has all three of these risk factors is eight
times more likely to develop atherosclerosis than is a
person who has none. Physical inactivity, diabetes, and
obesity are also risk factors for atherosclerosis. High
levels of the amino acid homocysteine and abnormal
levels of protein-coated fats called lipoproteins also
raise the risk of coronary artery disease. These substances are the targets of much current research. The
role of triglycerides, another fat that circulates in the
blood, in forming atherosclerotic plaques is unclear.
High levels of triglycerides are often associated with
diabetes, obesity, and low levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL cholesterol). The more HDL (‘‘good’’)
cholesterol, in the blood, the less likely is coronary
artery disease. These risk factors are all modifiable.
Non-modifiable risk factors are heredity, sex, and age.

Atherosclerosis

Lining of
artery

High cholesterol levels,
high blood pressure,
diabetes, obesity, viruses,
cigarette smoking, etc.,
cause injuries to the
lining of the artery,
creating areas where
higher levels of lipids
are trapped.

Monocyte

Muscle
T-cell

Monocytes (the largest of the
white blood cells) and T-cells
are attracted to the injury.

Monocytes, which become
macrophages when they leave
the bloodstream, and T-cells
penetrate the lining of the artery.
The macrophages soak up lipids,
becoming large foam cells and
distorting the inner surface of the
artery. Blood flow becomes
restricted.

Foam cell

Platelets

The result is a fibrous
lesion, made up in part
of muscle cells, proteins,
and collagen, that has at
its center a pool of lipids
and dead cells. Blood
flow can be very nearly
cut off by the blockage.

Further injury is inflicted by foam cells
attempting to remove lipids back to the
lungs, liver, spleen and lymph nodes
by again passing through the lining of
the artery.

When the arterial lining becomes
separated over the growing mass of
foam cells, platelets are attracted to the
site and begin the process of clot formation.

age are at increased risk. The high rate of severe
hypertension among African-Americans puts them
at increased risk.




Sex–Before age 60, men are more likely to have heart
attacks than women are. After age 60, the risk is
equal among men and women.
Age–Risk is higher in men who are 45 years of age and
older and women who are 55 years of age and older.

Symptoms differ depending upon the location of
the atherosclerosis.


In the coronary (heart) arteries: Chest pain, heart
attack, or sudden death.



In the carotid (brain) arteries: Sudden dizziness,
weakness, loss of speech, or blindness.

440



In the femoral (leg) arteries: Disease of the blood
vessels in the outer parts of the body (peripheral
vascular disease) causes cramping and fatigue in the
calves when walking.



In the renal (kidney) arteries: High blood pressure
that is difficult to treat.

Diagnosis
Physicians may be able to make a diagnosis of
atherosclerosis during a physical exam by means of a
stethoscope and gentle probing of the arteries with the
hand (palpation). More definite tests are electrocardiography, echocardiography or ultrasonography of the
arteries (for example, the carotids), radionuclide
scans, and angiography.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Arteriosclerosis—Hardening of the arteries. It
includes atherosclerosis, but the two terms are
often used synonymously.
Cholesterol—A fat-like substance that is made by
the human body and eaten in animal products.
Cholesterol is used to form cell membranes and
process hormones and vitamin D. High cholesterol
levels contribute to the development of
atherosclerosis.
HDL Cholesterol—About one-third or one-fourth
of all cholesterol is high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. High levels of HDL, nicknamed ‘‘good’’ cholesterol, decrease the risk of atherosclerosis.
LDL Cholesterol—Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is the primary cholesterol molecule. High
levels of LDL, nicknamed ‘‘bad’’ cholesterol,
increase the risk of atherosclerosis
Plaque—A deposit of fatty and other substances
that accumulates in the lining of the artery wall.
Triglyceride—A fat that comes from food or is
made from other energy sources in the body.
Elevated triglyceride levels contribute to the development of atherosclerosis.

An electrocardiogram shows the heart’s activity.
Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on
the patient’s body. They send impulses of the heart to a
recorder. The test takes about 10 minutes and is performed in a physician’s office. Exercise electrocardiography (stress test) is conducted while the patient
exercises on a treadmill or a stationary bike. It is
performed in a physician’s office or an exercise laboratory and takes 15-30 minutes.
Echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound, uses sound
waves to create an image of the heart’s chambers and
valves. A technician applies gel to a hand-held transducer, presses it against the patient’s chest, and images are
displayed on a monitor. This technique cannot evaluate
the coronary arteries directly. They are too small and
are in motion with the heart. Severe coronary artery
disease, however, may cause abnormal heart motion
that is detected by echocardiography. Performed in a
cardiology outpatient diagnostic laboratory, the test
takes 30-60 minutes. Ultrasonography is also used to
assess arteries of the neck and thighs.
Radionuclide angiography and thallium (or sestamibi) scanning enable physicians to see the blood
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

flow through the coronary arteries and the heart
chambers. Radioactive material is injected into the
bloodstream. A device that uses gamma rays to
produce an image of the radioactive material
(gamma camera) records pictures of the heart.
Radionuclide angiography is usually performed in
a hospital’s nuclear medicine department and takes
30-60 minutes. Thallium scanning is usually done
after an exercise stress test or after injection of a
vasodilator, a drug to enlarge the blood vessels, like
dipyridamole (Persantine). Thallium is injected, and
the scan is done then and again four hours (and
possibly 24 hours) later. Thallium scanning is
usually performed in a hospital’s nuclear medicine
department. Each scan takes 30-60 minutes.
Coronary angiography is the most accurate diagnostic method and the only one that requires entering
the body (invasive procedure). A cardiologist inserts a
catheter equipped with a viewing device into a blood
vessel in the leg or arm and guides it into the heart. The
patient has been given a contrast dye that makes
the heart visible to x rays. Motion pictures are taken
of the contrast dye flowing though the arteries.
Plaques and blockages, if present, are well defined.
The patient is awake but has been given a sedative.
Coronary angiography is performed in a cardiac
catheterization laboratory and takes from 30 minutes
to two hours.

Treatment
Treatment includes lifestyle changes, lipid-lowering drugs, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and coronary artery bypass surgery.
Atherosclerosis requires lifelong care.
Patients who have less severe atherosclerosis may
achieve adequate control through lifestyle changes
and drug therapy. Many of the lifestyle changes that
prevent disease progression–a low-fat, low-cholesterol
diet, losing weight (if necessary), exercise, controlling
blood pressure, and not smoking–also help prevent the
disease.
Most of the drugs prescribed for atherosclerosis
seek to lower cholesterol. Many popular lipid-lowering drugs can reduce LDL-cholesterol by an average
of 25-30% when combined with a low-fat, lowcholesterol diet. Lipid-lowering drugs include bile
acid resins, ‘‘statins’’ (drugs that effect HMG-CoA
reductase, an enzyme that controls the processing of
cholesterol), niacin, and fibric acid derivatives such as
gemfibrozil (Lobid). Aspirin helps prevent thrombosis
and a variety of other medications can be used to treat
the effects of atherosclerosis.

Atherosclerosis

KEY TERMS

Atherosclerosis

Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty
and bypass surgery are invasive procedures that
improve blood flow in the coronary arteries.
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (coronary angioplasty) is a non-surgical procedure in
which a catheter tipped with a balloon is threaded
from a blood vessel in the thigh into the blocked
artery. The balloon is inflated, compresses the plaque
to enlarge the blood vessel, and opens the blocked
artery. Coronary angioplasty is performed by a cardiologist in a hospital and generally requires a hospital
stay of one or two days. It is successful about 90% of
the time, but for one-third of patients the artery narrows again within six months. It can be repeated and a
‘‘stent’’ may be placed in the artery to help keep it open
(see below).
In coronary artery bypass surgery (bypass surgery), a detour is built around the blockage with a
healthy vein or artery, which then supplies oxygenrich blood to the heart. It is major surgery appropriate
for patients with blockages in two or three major
coronary arteries or severely narrowed left main coronary arteries, and for those who have not responded
to other treatments. It is performed in a hospital under
general anesthesia and uses a heart-lung machine.
About 70% of patients experience full relief; about
20% partial relief.
Three other semi-experimental surgical procedures may be used to treat atherosclerosis. In atherectomy, a cardiologist shaves off and removes strips
of plaque from the blocked artery. In laser angioplasty, a catheter with a laser tip is inserted to burn
or break down the plaque. A metal coil called a
stent may be permanently implanted to keep a
blocked artery open.

garlic is recommended, as is eating raw and cooked
fish, especially cold-water fish like salmon. Smoking,
alcohol, and stimulants like coffee should be avoided.
Chelation therapy, which uses anticoagulant drugs and
nutrients to dissolve plaque and flush it through the
kidneys, is controversial. Long-term remedies can be
prescribed by specialists in ayurvedic medicine, which
combines diet, herbal remedies, relaxation and exercise, and homeopathy, which treats a disease with
small doses of a drug that causes the symptoms of
the disease.

Prognosis
Atherosclerosis can be successfully treated but not
cured. Recent clinical studies have shown that atherosclerosis can be delayed, stopped, and even reversed by
aggressively lowering LDL cholesterol. New diagnostic techniques enable physicians to identify and treat
atherosclerosis in its earliest stages. New technologies
and surgical procedures have extended the lives of
many patients who would otherwise have died.
Research continues.

Prevention
A healthy lifestyle–eating right, regular exercise,
maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and controlling hypertension–can reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis, help keep the disease from
progressing, and sometimes cause it to regress.


Eat right-A healthy diet reduces excess levels of LDL
cholesterol and triglycerides. It includes a variety of
foods that are low in fat and cholesterol and high in
fiber; plenty of fruits and vegetables; and limited
sodium. Fat should comprise no more than 30%,
and saturated fat no more than 8-10%, of total
daily calories according to the American Heart
Association. Cholesterol should be limited to about
300 milligrams per day and sodium to about 2,400
milligrams. The ‘‘Food Guide’’ Pyramid developed
by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Health
and Human Services provides daily guidelines: 6-11
servings of bread, cereal, rice, and pasta; 3-5 servings
of vegetables; 2-4 servings of fruit; 2-3 servings of
milk, yogurt, and cheese; and 2-3 servings of meat,
poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts. Fats, oils,
and sweets should be used sparingly. Mono-unsaturated oils, like olive and rapeseed (Canola) are good
alternatives to use for cooking.



Exercise regularly–Aerobic exercise can lower blood
pressure, help control weight, and increase HDL
(‘‘good’’) cholesterol. It may keep the blood vessels

Alternative treatment
Alternative therapies that focus on diet and lifestyle can help prevent, retard, or reverse atherosclerosis. Herbal therapies that may be helpful include:
hawthorn (Crataegus laevigata), notoginseng root
(Panax notoginseng), garlic (Allium sativum), ginger
(Zingiber officinale), hot red or chili peppers, yarrow
(Achillea millefolium), and alfalfa (Medicago sativum).
Relaxation techniques including yoga, meditation,
guided imagery, biofeedback, and counseling and
other ‘‘talking’’ therapies may also be useful to prevent
or slow the progress of the disease. Dietary modifications focus on eating foods that are low in fats (especially saturated fats), cholesterol, sugar, and animal
proteins and high in fiber and antioxidants (found in
fresh fruits and vegetables). Liberal use of onions and
442



Maintain a desirable body weight–Losing weight can
help reduce total and LDL cholesterol, reduce triglycerides, and boost HDL cholesterol. It may also
reduce blood pressure. Eating right and exercising
are two key components in maintaining a desirable
body weight.
Do not smoke or use tobacco–Smoking has many
adverse effects on the heart but quitting can repair
damage. Ex-smokers face the same risk of heart disease as non-smokers within five to 10 years of quitting. Smoking is the worst thing a person can do to
their heart and lungs.
Seek treatment for hypertension–High blood pressure can be controlled through lifestyle changes–
reducing sodium and fat, exercising, managing
stress, quitting smoking, and drinking alcohol in
moderation–and medication. Drugs that provide
effective treatment are: diuretics, beta-blockers, sympathetic nerve inhibitors, vasodilators, angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors, and calcium antagonists. Hypertension usually has no symptoms so it
must be checked to be known. Like cholesterol,
hypertension is called a ‘‘silent killer.’’

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

I Athlete’s foot
Definition
A common fungus infection between the toes in
which the skin becomes itchy and sore, cracking and
peeling away. Athlete’s foot (also known as tinea pedis
or foot ringworm) can be treated, but it can be tenacious and difficult to clear up completely.

Description
Athlete’s foot is a very common condition of
itchy, peeling skin on the feet. In fact, it’s so common
that most people will have at least one episode at least
once in their lives. It’s less often found in women and
children under age 12. (Symptoms that look like athlete’s foot in young children most probably are caused
by some other skin condition).
Because the fungi grow well in warm, damp areas,
they flourish in and around swimming pools, showers,
and locker rooms. Tinea pedis got its common name
because the infection was common among athletes
who often used these areas.

Causes and symptoms
Athlete’s foot is caused by a fungal infection that
most often affects the fourth and fifth toe webs.
Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, and
Epidermophyton floccosum, the fungi that cause athlete’s foot, are unusual in that they live exclusively on
dead body tissue (hair, the outer layer of skin, and
nails). The fungus grows best in moist, damp, dark
places with poor ventilation. The problem doesn’t
occur among people who usually go barefoot.
Many people carry the fungus on their skin.
However, it will only flourish to the point of causing
athlete’s foot if conditions are right. Many people
believe athlete’s foot is highly contagious, especially in
public swimming pools and shower rooms. Research
has shown, however, that it is difficult to pick up the
infection simply by walking barefoot over a contaminated damp floor. Exactly why some people develop
the condition and others don’t is not well understood.
Sweaty feet, tight shoes, synthetic socks that don’t
absorb moisture well, a warm climate, and not drying
the feet well after swimming or bathing, all contribute
to the overgrowth of the fungus.
Symptoms of athlete’s foot include itchy, sore skin
on the toes, with scaling, cracking, inflammation, and
blisters. Blisters that break, exposing raw patches of

more flexible. Moderate to intense aerobic exercise
lasting about 30 minutes (or three 10-minute exercise
periods) four or more times per week is recommended, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention and the American College
of Sports Medicine. Aerobic exercise includes walking, jogging, and cycling, active gardening, climbing
stairs, or brisk housework. A physician should be
consulted before exercise if a person has atherosclerosis or is at increased risk for it.

of skin scrapings under a microscope. This test, called
a KOH preparation, treats a sample of tissue scraped
from the infected area with heat and potassium hydroxide (KOH). This treatment dissolves certain substances in the tissue sample, making it possible to see
the fungi under the microscope.

Treatment

Athlete’s foot may be resistant to medication and
should not be ignored. Simple cases usually respond
well to antifungal creams or sprays (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, miconazole nitrate, sulconazole nitrate, or
tolnaftate). If the infection is resistant to topical treatment, the doctor may prescribe an oral antifungal drug.
Untreated athlete’s foot may lead to a secondary
bacterial infection in the skin cracks.

Alternative treatment
A footbath containing cinnamon has been shown
to slow down the growth of certain molds and fungi,
and is said to be very effective in clearing up athlete’s
foot. To make the bath:

tissue, can cause pain and swelling. As the infection
spreads, itching and burning may get worse.
If it’s not treated, athlete’s foot can spread to the
soles of the feet and toenails. Stubborn toenail infections
may appear at the same time, with crumbling, scaling and
thickened nails, and nail loss. The infection can spread
further if patients scratch and then touch themselves
elsewhere (especially in the groin or under the arms).
It’s also possible to spread the infection to other parts
of the body via contaminated bed sheets or clothing.



add eight to 10 broken cinnamon sticks



reduce heat and simmer five minutes



Other herbal remedies used externally to treat
athlete’s foot include: a foot soak or powder containing goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis); tea tree oil
(Melaleuca spp.); or calendula (Calendula officinalis)
cream to help heal cracked skin.

Prognosis
Athlete’s foot usually responds well to treatment,
but it is important to take all medication as directed by
a dermatologist, even if the skin appears to be free of
fungus. Otherwise, the infection could return. The toenail infections that may accompany athlete’s foot,
however, are typically very hard to treat effectively.

Diagnosis
Not all foot rashes are athlete’s foot, which is why a
physician should diagnose the condition before any
remedies are used. Using nonprescription products on a
rash that is not athlete’s foot could make the rash worse.
A dermatologist can diagnose the condition by
physical examination and by examining a preparation
444

Prevention
Good personal hygiene and a few simple precautions can help prevent athlete’s foot. To prevent
spread of athlete’s foot:


wash feet daily



dry feet thoroughly (especially between toes)
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

avoid tight shoes (especially in summer)



wear sandals during warm weather



don’t wear socks made of synthetic material



go barefoot outdoors when possible



wear bathing shoes in public bathing or showering
areas

use a good quality foot powder

don’t wear sneakers without socks



wash towels, contaminated floors, and shower stalls
well with hot soapy water if anyone in the family has
athlete’s foot.

Cardiac enlargement is associated with dynamic training. The heart’s response to static training is hypertrophy, thickening of the muscle walls of the heart. As
the wall of the heart adapts, there are changes in the
electrical conducting system of the heart. Because of
the larger volume of blood being pumped with each
heart beat, the heart rate when at rest decreases
below the normal level for nonathletes.
Sudden unexpected death (SUD) is the death of an
athlete, usually during or shortly after physical activity. Often, there is no warning that the person will
experience SUD, although in some cases, warning
signs appear which cause the person to seek medical
advice. Importantly, cases of death occurring during
physical activity are not caused by athletic heart
syndrome, but by undiagnosed heart disorders.

Athletic heart syndrome is the consequence of a
normal adaptation by the heart to increased physical
activity. The changes in the electrical conduction system of the heart may be pronounced and diagnostic,
but should not cause problems. In the case of SUD,
other heart problems are involved. In 85-97% of the
cases of SUD, an underlying structural defect of the
heart has been noted.

Diagnosis

I Athletic heart syndrome
Definition
Athletic heart syndrome is the adaptation of
an athlete’s heart in response the physiologic stresses
of strenuous physical training. It can be difficult to
distinguish a significant medical condition from an
athletic heart.

Description
The heart adapts to physical demands by enlarging, especially the left ventricle. Enlargement increases
the cardiac output, the amount of blood pumped with
each beat of the heart. The exact type of adaptation
depends on the nature of the physical demand. There
are two types of demand, static and dynamic. Static
demand involves smaller groups of muscles under
extreme resistance for brief period. An example is
weight lifting. Dynamic training involves larger groups
of muscles at lower resistance for extended periods of
time. Examples are aerobic training and tennis.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The changes in the heart beat caused by the electrical conduction system of the heart are detectable on
an electrocardiogram. Many of the changes seen in
athletic heart syndrome mimic those of various heart
diseases. Careful examination must be made to distinguish heart disease from athletic heart syndrome.

Prognosis
The yearly rate for occurrence of SUD in people
less than 35 years of age is less than 7 incidents per
100,000. Of all SUD cases, only about 8% are exercise
related. On a national basis, this means that each year
approximately 25 athletes experience SUD. In persons
over age 35, the incidence of SUD is approximately 55
in 100,000, with only 3% of the cases occurring during
exercise.

Atkins diet

I Atkins diet
Definition
The Atkins diet is a high-protein, high-fat, and
very low-carbohydrate regimen. It emphasizes meat,
cheese, and eggs, while discouraging foods such as
bread, pasta, fruit, and sugar. It is a form of ketogenic diet.

Purpose
The primary benefit of the diet is rapid and substantial weight loss. By restricting carbohydrate
intake, the body will burn more fat stored in the
body. Since there are no limits on the amount of
calories or quantities of foods allowed on the diet,
there is little hunger between meals. According to
Atkins, the diet can alleviate symptoms of conditions
such as fatigue, irritability, headaches, depression, and
some types of joint and muscle pain.

Description
The regimen is a low-carbohydrate, or ketogenic
diet, characterized by initial rapid weight loss, usually
due to water loss. Drastically reducing the amount of
carbohydrate intake causes liver and muscle glycogen
loss, which has a strong but temporary diuretic effect.
Long-term weight loss occurs because with a low
amount of carbohydrate intake, the body burns stored
fat for energy.
The four-step diet starts with a two-week induction program designed to rebalance an individual’s
metabolism. Unlimited amounts of fat and protein
are allowed but carbohydrate intake is restricted to
20 grams per day. Foods allowed include butter, oil,
meat, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, and cream. The daily
amount of carbohydrates allowed equals about three
cups of salad vegetables, such as lettuce, cucumbers,
and celery.
The second stage is for ongoing weight loss. It
allows 20-40 grams of carbohydrates a day. When
the individual is about 10 pounds from their desired
weight, they begin the pre-maintenance phase. This
gradually adds one to three servings a week of high
carbohydrate foods, such as a piece of fruit or slice of
whole-wheat bread. When the desired weight is
reached, the maintenance stage begins. It allows
40-60 grams of carbohydrates per day.
Opinion from the general medical community
remains mixed on the Atkins diet. There have been
no significant long-term scientific studies on the diet.
446

A number of leading medical and health organizations, including the American Medical Association,
American Dietetic Association (ADA), and the
American Heart Association oppose it. It is drastically
different than the dietary intakes recommended by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture and the National
Institutes of Health. Much of the opposition is because
the diet is lacking in some vitamins and nutrients, and
because it is high in fat. In a hearing before the U.S.
Congress on February 24, 2000, an ADA representative called the Atkins diet ‘‘hazardous’’ and said it
lacked scientific credibility.

Preparations
No advance preparation is needed to go on the
diet. However, as with most diets, it is generally considered appropriate to consult with a physician and to
have a physical evaluation before starting such a nutritional regimen. The evaluation should include blood
tests to determine levels of cholesterol, triglycerides,
glucose, insulin, and uric acid. A glucose tolerance test
is also recommended.

Precautions
Adherence to the Atkins diet can result in vitamin
and mineral deficiencies. In his books, Atkins recommends a wide-range of nutritional supplements, including a multi-vitamin. Among his recommendations,
Atkins suggests the following daily dosages: 300-600
micrograms (mcg) of chromium picolinate, 100-400
milligrams (mg) of pantetheine, 200 mcg of selenium,
and 450-675 mcg of biotin.
The diet is not recommended for lacto-ovo vegetarians, since it cannot be done as successfully without
protein derived from animal products. Also, vegans
cannot follow this diet, since a vegan diet is too high in
carbohydrates, according to Atkins. Instead, he
recommends vegetarians with a serious weight problem give up vegetarianism, or at least include fish in
their diet.

Side effects
According to Atkins, the diet causes no adverse
side effects. Many health care professionals disagree. In a fact sheet for the Healthcare Reality
Check Web site (<http://www.hcrc.org>), Ellen
Coleman, a registered dietician and author, said
the diet may have serious side effects for some people. She said complications associated with the diet
include ketosis, dehydration, electrolyte loss, calcium
depletion, weakness, nausea, and kidney problems.

a ketogenic diet—a high protein, high fat, and very low
carbohydrate regimen resulting in ketosis. It emphasizes
meat, cheese, and eggs, while discouraging foods such as
bread, pasta, fruit, and sugar. It first came to public attention in 1972 with the publication of Dr. Atkins’ Diet

unlike most other fad diet books, this one has remained
popular. At last count, it had been reprinted 28 times and

I Atopic dermatitis
Definition
Eczema is a general term used to describe a variety
of conditions that cause an itchy, inflamed skin
rash. Atopic dermatitis, a form of eczema, is a noncontagious disorder characterized by chronically
inflamed skin and sometimes intolerable itching.

Description
Atopic dermatitis refers to a wide range of diseases that are often associated with stress and allergic
disorders that involve the respiratory system, like
asthma and hay fever. Although atopic dermatitis
can appear at any age, it is most common in children
and young adults. Symptoms usually abate before the
age of 25 and do not affect the patient’s general health.
About one in ten babies develop a form of atopic
dermatitis called infantile eczema. Characterized by skin
that oozes and becomes encrusted, infantile eczema most
often occurs on the face and scalp. The condition usually
improves before the child’s second birthday, and medical
attention can keep symptoms in check until that time.
When atopic dermatitis develops after infancy,
inflammation, blistering, oozing, and crusting are less
pronounced. The patient’s sores become dry, turn from
red to brownish-gray, and skin may thicken and become
scaly. In dark-skinned individuals, this condition can
cause the complexion to lighten or darken. Itching associated with this condition is usually worst at night. It
can be so intense that patients scratch until their sores
bleed, sometimes causing scarring and infection.
Atopic dermatitis affects about 3% of the population of the United States, and about 80% of the people
who have the condition have one or more relatives with
the same condition or a similar one. Symptoms tend to
be most severe in females. Atopic dermatitis can erupt on
any part of the skin, and crusted, thickened patches on
the fingers, palms, or the soles of the feet can last for
years. In teenagers and young adults, atopic dermatitis
often appears on one or more of the following areas:

Causes and symptoms
While allergic reactions often trigger atopic

of an inherited over-active immune system or a
genetic defect that causes the skin to lose abnormally large amounts of moisture. The condition can

be aggravated by a cycle that develops in which the
skin itches, the patient scratches, the condition worsens, the itching worsens, the patient scratches, etc.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

This cycle must be broken by relieving the itching to
allow the skin time to heal. If the skin becomes
broken, there is also a risk of developing skin infections which, if not recognized and treated promptly,
can become more serious.
Symptoms of atopic dermatitis include the
following:


an itchy rash and dry, thickened skin on areas of the
body where moisture can be trapped



continual scratching



chronic fatigue, caused when itching disrupts sleep
449

Atopic dermatitis

An individual is more at-risk for developing the
condition if there is a personal or family history of
atopic dermatitis, hay fever, asthma, or other allergies.
Exposure to any of the following can cause a flare-up:


hot or cold temperatures



wool and synthetic fabrics



detergents, fabric softeners, and chemicals



use of drugs that suppress immune-system activity

Certain foods, such as peanuts, cow’s milk, eggs,
and fish, can trigger symptoms of atopic dermatitis.
A small percentage of patients with atopic dermatitis
find that their symptoms worsen after having been
exposed to dust, feather pillows, rough-textured fabrics, or other materials to which dust adheres.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is usually based on
the patient’s symptoms and personal and family
health history. Skin tests do not generally provide
reliable information about this condition.

Treatment
Atopic dermatitis cannot be cured, but the severity and duration of symptoms can be controlled.
A dermatologist should be consulted when symptoms
first appear, and is likely to recommend warm baths to
loosen encrusted skin, followed by applications of
petroleum jelly or vegetable shortening to prevent the
skin’s natural moisture from escaping.
Externally applied (topical) steroids or preparations containing coal tar can relieve minor itching, but
coal tar has an unpleasant odor, stains clothes, and
may increase skin-cancer risk. Excessive use of steroid
creams in young children can alter growth. Pregnant
women should not use products that contain coal tar.
Topical steroids can cause itching, burning, acne, permanent stretch marks, and thinning and spotting of
the skin. Applying topical steroids to the area around
the eyes can cause glaucoma.

who use cortisone salves or lotions to control widespread symptoms. Oral cortisone may be prescribed
if the patient does not respond to other treatments,
but patients who take the medication for more than
two weeks have a greater-than-average risk of developing severe symptoms when the treatment is
discontinued.
Allergy shots rarely improve atopic dermatitis
and sometimes aggravate the symptoms. Since food
allergies may trigger atopic dermatitis, the doctor
may suggest eliminating certain foods from the diet if
other treatments prove ineffective.
If symptoms are extremely severe, ultraviolet
light therapy may be prescribed, and a wet body
wrap recommended to help the skin retain moisture. This technique, used most often with children,
involves sleeping in a warm room while wearing
wet pajamas under dry clothing, rain gear, or a
nylon sweatsuit. The patient’s face may be covered
with wet gauze covered by elastic bandages, and
his hands encased in wet socks covered by dry
ones.
A physician should be notified if the condition is
widespread or resists treatment, or the skin oozes,
becomes encrusted, or smells, as this may indicate an
infection.

Alternative treatment
Alternative therapies can sometimes bring relief
or resolution of atopic dermatitis when conventional
therapies are not helping. If the condition becomes
increasingly widespread or infected, a physician
should be consulted.
Helpful alternative treatments for atopic dermatitis may include:


Taking regular brisk walks, followed by bathing in
warm water sprinkled with essential oil of lavender
(Lavandula officinalis); lavender oil acts as a nerve
relaxant for the whole body including the skin

Oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine
(Benadryl), can relieve symptoms of allergy-related
atopic dermatitis. More concentrated topical steroids
are recommended for persistent symptoms. A mild
tranquilizer may be prescribed to reduce stress and
help the patient sleep, and antibiotics are used to
treat secondary infections.



Supplementing the diet daily with zinc, fish oils, vitamin A, vitamin E, and evening primrose oil (Oenothera
biennis)–all good sources of nutrients for the skin



Reducing or eliminating red meat from the diet



Eliminating or rotating potentially allergic foods
such as cow’s milk, peanuts, wheat, eggs, and soy

Cortisone ointments should be used sparingly,
and strong preparations should never be applied
to the face, groin, armpits, or rectal area. Regular
medical monitoring is recommended for patients



Implementing stress reduction techniques in daily
life.

Prognosis
Atopic dermatitis is unpredictable. Although
symptoms occur less often with age and sometimes
disappear altogether, they can recur without warning. Atopic dermatitis lowers resistance to infection
and increases the risk of developing cataracts. Sixty
percent of patients with atopic dermatitis will
experience flares and remissions throughout their
lives.

Prevention
Research has shown that babies weaned from
breast milk before they are four months old are almost
three times more likely than other babies to develop
recurrent eczema. Feeding eggs or fish to a baby less
than one year old can activate symptoms, and babies
should be shielded from such irritants as mites, molds,
pet hair, and smoke.
Possible ways to prevent flare-ups include the
following:

I Atrial ectopic beats
Definition
Atrial ectopic beats (AEB) refers to a contraction
of the upper heart chamber which occurs before it
would be expected. Atrial ectopic beats are also
known as premature atrial beats, premature atrial
complex (PAC), or atrial extrasystole.

Description
An AEB is usually a harmless disturbance in the
normal rhythm of the heart. It can occur only occasionally, in a regular pattern, or several may occur in
sequence and then disappear. Most often, the person is
unaware of the event.

Causes and symptoms
As people age, extra beats tend to happen more
frequently even in perfectly healthy individuals. AEB
may be triggered or increased by stress, caffeine, smoking, and some medicines. Cold remedies containing
451

Atrial ectopic beats

treatment of this condition include burdock (Arctium
lappa) and Ruta (Ruta graveolens). Long-term herbal
therapy requires monitoring and should be guided by
an experienced practitioner.

Atrial fibrillation and flutter

ephedrine or pseudoephedrine have been known to
increase the incidence of atrial ectopic beats. AEB
may also be the result of an enlarged atria, lung disease, or the result of reduced blood supply to that area
of the heart.
If a person is aware of the event, the first symptom
of AEB is usually a feeling that the heart has skipped
or missed a beat. This is often accompanied by a
feeling that the heart is thumping or pounding in the
chest. The thumping or pounding is caused by the fact
that when there is an AEB, the pause before the next
beat is usually longer than normal. The next beat must
be stronger than usual to pump the accumulated blood
out of the chamber.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of AEB is often suspected on the basis of
the patient’s description of the occurrence. An electrocardiogram (ECG) can confirm the diagnosis. An ECG
shows the heart beat as three wave forms. The first wave
is called P, the second is called QRS, and the last is T. An
atrial ectopic beat will show up on the ECG as a P wave
that occurs closer than usual to the preceding T wave.

Treatment
Atrial ectopic beats do not usually require treatment. If treatment is necessary because the beats occur
frequently and cause intolerable discomfort, the doctor may prescribe medication.

Prognosis
Occasional AEB usually have no significance. If
they increase in frequency, they can lead to atrial
tachycardia or fibrillation and to a decrease in cardiac
output.

Prevention
AEB cannot usually be prevented. Aggravating
factors can be addressed, like excessive stimulants,
and uncontrolled pulmonary disorders.

I Atrial fibrillation and flutter
Definition
Atrial fibrillation and flutter are abnormal heart
rhythms in which the atria, or upper chambers of the
heart, are out of sync with the ventricles, or lower
chambers of the heart. In atrial fibrillation, the atria
‘‘quiver’’ chaotically and the ventricles beat irregularly. In atrial flutter, the atria beat regularly and
faster than the ventricles.

Description
Atrial fibrillation and flutter are two types of
cardiac arrhythmias, irregularities in the heart’s
rhythm. Nearly 2 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, according to the American Heart Association.
It is the most common chronic arrhythmia. Atrial
flutter is less common, but both of these arrhythmias
can cause a blood clot to form in the heart. This can
lead to a stroke or a blockage carried by the blood flow
(an embolism) anywhere in the body’s arteries. Atrial
fibrillation is responsible for about 15% of strokes.
The atria are the heart’s two small upper chambers. In atrial fibrillation, the heart beat is completely irregular. The atrial muscles contract very
quickly and irregularly; the ventricles, the heart’s
two large lower chambers, beat irregularly but not
as fast as the atria. When the atria fibrillate, blood
that is not completely pumped out can pool and
form a clot. In atrial flutter, the heart beat is
usually very fast but steady. The atria beat faster
than the ventricles.
Atrial fibrillation often occurs in people with various types of heart disease. Atrial fibrillation may also
result from an inflammation of the heart’s covering
(pericarditis), chest trauma or surgery, pulmonary disease, and certain medications. Atrial fibrillation is
more common in older people; about 10% of people
over the age of 75 have it. Atrial flutter and fibrillation
usually occur in people with hypertensive or coronary
heart disease and other types of heart disorders.

Diagnosis
A doctor can sometimes hear these arrhythmias
using an instrument (a stethoscope) to listen to the
sounds within the chest. Atrial fibrillation and flutter
are usually diagnosed through electrocardiography
(EKGs), an exercise stress test, a 24-hour Holter
EKG monitor, or a telephone cardiac monitor. An
EKG shows the heart’s activity and may reveal a
lack of oxygen (ischemia). Electrodes covered with
conducting jelly are placed on the patient’s chest,
arms, and legs. The electrodes send impulses of the
heart’s activity through a monitor (called an oscilloscope) to a recorder that traces the pattern of the
impulses onto paper. The test takes about 10 minutes
and is performed in a doctor’s office. The exercise
stress test measures how the heart and blood vessels
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

respond to work when the patient is exercising on a
treadmill or a stationary bike. This test is performed in
a doctor’s office within an exercise laboratory and
takes 15-30 minutes.
In 24-hour EKG (Holter) monitoring, the
patient wears a small, portable tape recorder connected to disks on his/her chest that record the
heart’s rhythm during normal activities. An EKG
called transtelephonic monitoring identifies arrhythmias that occur infrequently. Like Holter monitoring, transtelephonic monitoring continues for days
or weeks and enables patients to send the EKG via
telephone to a monitoring station when an arrhythmia
is felt, or to store the information in the recorder and
transmit it later. Doctors can also use high-frequency
sound waves (echocardiography) to determine the
structure and function of the heart. This diagnostic
method is often helpful to evaluate for underlying
heart disease.

Treatment
Atrial fibrillation and flutter are usually treated
with medications and/or electrical shock (cardioversion). In some cases, removal of a small portion of the
heart (ablation), implantation of a pacemaker or a
cardioverter defibrillator, or maze surgery is needed.
If the heart rate cannot be quickly controlled,
electrical cardioversion may be used. Cardioversion,
the electric shock to the chest wall, is usually performed emergencies. This device briefly suspends the
heart’s activity and allows it to return to a normal
rhythm.
Ablation destroys the heart tissue that causes the
arrhythmia. The tissue can be destroyed by catheterization or surgery. Radiofrequency catheter ablation,
performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory, can
cure atrial flutter and control the heart rate in atrial
fibrillation. The patient is awake but sedated. A thin
tube called a catheter is inserted into a vein and is
threaded into the heart. At the end of the catheter, a
device maps the electrical pathways of the heart. A
cardiologist, a doctor specializing in the heart, uses
this map to identify the pathway(s) causing the
arrhythmia, and then eliminates it (them) with bursts
of high-frequency radio waves. Surgical ablation is
performed in an operating room under general
anesthesia. Computerized mapping techniques are
combined with a cold probe to destroy arrhythmiacausing tissue. Ablation is generally successful. When
ablation is used for atrial fibrillation, it is usually
followed by implantation of a pacemaker as well as
drug therapy.
453

Atrial fibrillation and flutter

KEY TERMS

Atrial septal defect

A pacemaker is a battery-powered device about the
size of a matchbox that is surgically implanted near the
collarbone to regulate the heart beat. Lead wires
threaded to the right side of the heart supply electrical
energy to pace the atria and ventricles. The implantable
cardioverter defibrillator is a treatment for serious
arrhythmias. The battery-powered device senses an
abnormal heart rhythm and automatically provides electrical shock(s). The shock(s) suspends heart activity and
then allows the heart to initiate a normal rhythm. Wire
electrodes on the device are attached to the heart. Some
of the electrodes are attached to the outside of the heart
and some are attached to the inside of the heart through
veins. The newest implantable cardioverter defibrillators
can be implanted in the chest wall and do not require
open chest surgery. These devices weigh less than 10 oz
and generally last seven or eight years. An implantable
cardioverter defibrillator is usually used with drug therapy, but the amount medication is reduced. In maze
surgery, often the last resort, surgeons create a maze of
stitches (sutures) that help the heart’s electrical impulses
travel effectively.
Most of the drugs used for treatment have potential side effects and should be carefully monitored by a
doctor. The goal of treatment is to control the rate and
rhythm of the heart and to prevent the formation of
blood clots. If the arrhythmia is caused by heart disease, the heart disease will also be treated. The
American Heart Association recommends aggressive
treatment.
A digitalis drug, most commonly digoxin, is
usually prescribed to control the heart rate. Digitalis
drugs slow the heart’s electrical impulses, helping to
restore the normal rate and rhythm. These drugs also
increase the ability of the heart’s muscular layer to
contract and pump properly. Beta-blockers and
calcium channel blockers can also be used for this
purpose. Beta-blockers slow the speed of electrical
impulses through the heart. Some calcium channel
blockers dampen the heart’s response to erratic electrical impulses.
To prevent blood clots, aspirin or warfarin
(Coumadin) is administered. Warfarin, however, has
potential bleeding side effects, especially in older
patients. Amiodarone is fairly efffective for atrial flutter. This drug is often able to maintain the heart’s
proper rhythm and can also help control the heart
rate when the flutter occurs.

Prognosis
Patients with atrial fibrillation and flutter can
live a normal life for many years as long as the
454

arrhythmia is controlled and serious blood clots
are prevented.

Prevention
Atrial fibrillation and flutter can sometimes be
prevented when the cause can be identified and controlled. Depending on the cause, prevention could
include:


treating the underlying heart disease



reducing stress and anxiety



reducing or stopping consumption of caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco; and/or



discontinuing diet pills or other medications (overthe-counter or prescription)

I Atrial septal defect
Definition
An atrial septal defect is an abnormal opening in
the wall separating the left and right upper chambers
(atria) of the heart.

Description
During the normal development of the fetal
heart, there is an opening in the wall (the septum)
separating the left and right upper chambers of the
heart. Normally, this opening closes before birth,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Different types of atrial septal defects can
occur, and they are classified according to where
in the separating wall they are found. The most
commonly found atrial septal defect occurs in the
middle of the atrial septum and accounts for about
70% of all atrial septal defects. Abnormal openings
can form in the upper and lower parts of the atrial
septum as well.

Causes and symptoms
Abnormal openings in the atrial septum occur
during fetal development and are twice as common
in females as in males. These abnormalities can go
unnoticed if the opening is small, producing no
abnormal symptoms. If the defect is big, large
amounts of blood flowing from the left to the
right atrium will cause the right atrium to swell to
hold the extra blood.
People born with an atrial septal defect can have
no symptoms through their twenties, but by age 40,
most people with this condition have symptoms that
can include shortness of breath, rapid abnormal beating of the atria (atrial fibrillation), and eventually
heart failure.

Diagnosis
Atrial septal defects can be identified by various
methods. Abnormal changes in the sound of the
heart beats can be heard when a doctor listens to
the heart with a stethoscope. In addition, a chest
x ray, an electrocardiogram (ECG, an electrical
printout of the heartbeats), and an echocardiogram
(a test that uses sound waves to form a detailed
image of the heart) can also be used to identify
this condition.
An atrial septal defect can also be diagnosed by
using a test called cardiac catheterization. This test
involves inserting a very thin tube (catheter) into the
heart’s chambers to measure the amount of oxygen
present in the blood within the heart. If the heart
has an opening between the atria, oxygen-rich blood
from the left atrium enters the right atrium.
Through cardiac catheterization, doctors can detect
the higher-than-normal amount of oxygen in the
heart’s right atrium, right ventricle, and the large
blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs, where

the blood would normally subsequently get its
oxygen.

Treatment
Atrial septal defects often correct themselves without medical treatments by the age of two. If this dose
not happen, surgery is done by sewing the hole closed,
or by sewing a patch of Dacron material or a piece of
the sac that surrounds the heart (the pericardium),
over the opening.
Some patients can have the defect fixed by having
an clam-shaped plug placed over the opening. This
plug is a man-made device that is put in place through
a catheter inserted into the heart.

Prognosis
Individuals with small defects can live a normal
life, but larger defects require surgical correction. Less
than 1% of people younger than 45 years of age die
from corrective surgery. Five to ten percent of patients
can die from the surgery if they are older than 40 and
have other heart-related problems. When an atrial
septal defect is corrected within the first 20 years of
life, there is an excellent chance for the individual to
live normally.

Attention-deficit/
Hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD)

Definition
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
is a developmental disorder characterized by distractibility, hyperactivity, impulsive behaviors, and the
inability to remain focused on tasks or activities.

Drugs Used To Treat ADHD

appetite

Description
ADHD, also known as hyperkinetic disorder
(HKD) outside of the United States, is estimated to
affect 3-9% of children, and afflicts boys more often
than girls. Although difficult to assess in infancy and
toddlerhood, signs of ADHD may begin to appear as
early as age two or three, but the symptom picture
changes as adolescence approaches. Many symptoms,
particularly hyperactivity, diminish in early adulthood, but impulsivity and inattention problems
remain with up to 50% of ADHD individuals
throughout their adult life.
Children with ADHD have short attention
spans, becoming easily bored and/or frustrated
with tasks. Although they may be quite intelligent,
their lack of focus frequently results in poor grades
and difficulties in school. ADHD children act
impulsively, taking action first and thinking later.
They are constantly moving, running, climbing,
squirming, and fidgeting, but often have trouble
with gross and fine motor skills and, as a result,
may be physically clumsy and awkward. Their
clumsiness may extend to the social arena, where
they are sometimes shunned due to their impulsive
and intrusive behavior.

Causes and symptoms
The causes of ADHD are not known. However,
it appears that heredity plays a major role in the
development of ADHD. Children with an ADHD
parent or sibling are more likely to develop the
disorder themselves. In 2004, scientists reported at
least 20 candidate genes that might contribute to
ADHD, but no single gene stood out as the gene
causing the condition. Before birth, ADHD children
may have been exposed to poor maternal nutrition,
viral infections, or maternal substance abuse. In
early childhood, exposure to lead or other toxins
can cause ADHD-like symptoms. Traumatic brain
injury or neurological disorders may also trigger

KEY TERMS
Conduct disorder—A behavioral and emotional
disorder of childhood and adolescence. Children
with a conduct disorder act inappropriately,
infringe on the rights of others, and violate societal
norms.
Nervous tic—A repetitive, involuntary action, such
as the twitching of a muscle or repeated blinking.
Oppositional defiant disorder—A disorder characterized by hostile, deliberately argumentative, and
defiant behavior toward authority figures.

ADHD symptoms. Although the exact cause of
ADHD is not known, an imbalance of certain neurotransmitters, the chemicals in the brain that transmit messages between nerve cells, is believed to be
the mechanism behind ADHD symptoms.
A widely publicized study conducted by Dr. Ben
Feingold in the early 1970s suggested that allergies to
certain foods and food additives caused the characteristic hyperactivity of ADHD children. Although some
children may have adverse reactions to certain foods
that can affect their behavior (for example, a rash
might temporarily cause a child to be distracted from
other tasks), carefully controlled follow-up studies
have uncovered no link between food allergies and
ADHD. Another popularly held misconception
about food and ADHD is that the consumption of
sugar causes hyperactive behavior. Again, studies
have shown no link between sugar intake and
ADHD. It is important to note, however, that a nutritionally balanced diet is important for normal development in all children.
Psychologists and other mental health professionals typically use the criteria listed in the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth

Diagnosis
The first step in determining if a child has ADHD
is to consult with a pediatrician. The pediatrician can
make an initial evaluation of the child’s developmental
maturity compared to other children in his or her age
group. The physician should also perform a comprehensive physical examination to rule out any organic
causes of ADHD symptoms, such as an overactive
thyroid or vision or hearing problems.
If no organic problem can be found, a psychologist, psychiatrist, neurologist, neuropsychologist, or
learning specialist is typically consulted to perform a
comprehensive ADHD assessment. A complete medical, family, social, psychiatric, and educational history
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

is compiled from existing medical and school records
and from interviews with parents and teachers.
Interviews may also be conducted with the child,
depending on his or her age. Along with these interviews, several clinical inventories may also be used,
such as the Conners Rating Scales (Teacher’s
Questionnaire and Parent’s Questionnaire), Child
Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Achenbach
Child Behavior Rating Scales. These inventories provide valuable information on the child’s behavior in
different settings and situations. In addition, the
Wender Utah Rating Scale has been adapted for use
in diagnosing ADHD in adults.
It is important to note that mental disorders such
as depression and anxiety disorder can cause symptoms similar to ADHD. A complete and comprehensive psychiatric assessment is critical to differentiate
ADHD from other possible mood and behavioral disorders. Bipolar disorder, for example, may be misdiagnosed as ADHD.
Public schools are required by federal law to offer
free ADHD testing upon request. A pediatrician can
also provide a referral to a psychologist or pediatric
specialist for ADHD assessment. Parents should
check with their insurance plans to see if these services
are covered.

Treatment
Psychosocial therapy, usually combined with
medications, is the treatment approach of choice to
alleviate ADHD symptoms. Psychostimulants, such
as dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), pemoline
(Cylert), and methylphenidate (Ritalin) are commonly
prescribed to control hyperactive and impulsive behavior and increase attention span. They work by stimulating the production of certain neurotransmitters in
the brain. Possible side effects of stimulants include
nervous tics, irregular heartbeat, loss of appetite, and
insomnia. However, the medications are usually welltolerated and safe in most cases. In 2004, longer-acting
stimulants had been released to treat adult ADHD.
In 2004, the American Academy of Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry listed the first nonstimulant as a
first-line therapy for ADHD. Called atomoxetine HCI
(Strattera), it is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.
In children who do not respond well to stimulant
therapy, tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine
(Norpramin, Pertofane) and amitriptyline (Elavil) are
sometimes recommended. Reported side effects of
these drugs include persistent dry mouth, sedation,
disorientation, and cardiac arrhythmia (particularly

Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

Edition (DSM-IV) as a guideline for determining the
presence of ADHD. For a diagnosis of ADHD, DSMIV requires the presence of at least six of the following
symptoms of inattention, or six or more symptoms of
hyperactivity and impulsivity combined:

with desipramine). Other medications prescribed for
ADHD therapy include buproprion (Wellbutrin), an
antidepressant; fluoxetine (Prozac), an SSRI antidepressant; and carbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol), an
anticonvulsant drug. Clonidine (Catapres), an antihypertensive medication, has also been used to control
aggression and hyperactivity in some ADHD children,
although it should not be used with Ritalin. A child’s
response to medication will change with age and
maturation, so ADHD symptoms should be monitored closely and prescriptions adjusted accordingly.
Behavior modification therapy uses a reward system to reinforce good behavior and task completion
and can be implemented both in the classroom and at
home. A tangible reward such as a sticker may be
given to the child every time he completes a task or
behaves in an acceptable manner. A chart system may
be used to display the stickers and visually illustrate
the child’s progress. When a certain number of stickers
are collected, the child may trade them in for a bigger
reward such as a trip to the zoo or a day at the beach.
The reward system stays in place until the good behavior becomes ingrained.
A variation of this technique, cognitive-behavioral
therapy, works to decrease impulsive behavior by getting the child to recognize the connection between
thoughts and behavior, and to change behavior by
changing negative thinking patterns.
Individual psychotherapy can help an ADHD
child build self-esteem, give them a place to discuss
their worries and anxieties, and help them gain insight
into their behavior and feelings. Family therapy may
also be beneficial in helping family members develop
coping skills and in working through feelings of guilt
or anger parents may be experiencing.
ADHD children perform better within a familiar,
consistent, and structured routine with positive reinforcements for good behavior and real consequences
for bad. Family, friends, and caretakers should all be
educated on the special needs and behaviors of the
ADHD child. Communication between parents and
teachers is especially critical to ensuring an ADHD
child has an appropriate learning environment.

Alternative treatment
A number of alternative treatments exist for
ADHD. Although there is a lack of controlled studies
to prove their efficacy, proponents report that they are
successful in controlling symptoms in some ADHD
patients. Some of the more popular alternative treatments include:
458



EEG (electroencephalograph) biofeedback. By measuring brainwave activity and teaching the ADHD
patient which type of brainwave is associated with
attention, EEG biofeedback attempts to train
patients to generate the desired brainwave activity.



Dietary therapy. Based in part on the Feingold food
allergy diet, dietary therapy focuses on a nutritional
plan that is high in protein and complex carbohydrates and free of white sugar and salicylate-containing foods such as strawberries, tomatoes, and grapes.



Herbal therapy. Herbal therapy uses a variety of
natural remedies to address the symptoms of
ADHD, such as ginkgo (Gingko biloba) for memory
and mental sharpness and chamomile (Matricaria
recutita) extract for calming. The safety of herbal
remedies has not been demonstrated in controlled
studies. For example, it is known that gingko may
affect blood coagulation, but controlled studies have
not yet evaluated the risk of the effect.



Homeopathic medicine. The theory of homeopathic
medicine is to treat the whole person at a core level.
Constitutional homeopathic care requires consulting
with a well-trained homeopath who has experience
working with ADD and ADHD individuals.

Prognosis
Untreated, ADHD negatively affects a child’s
social and educational performance and can seriously
damage his or her sense of self-esteem. ADHD children have impaired relationships with their peers, and
may be looked upon as social outcasts. They may be
perceived as slow learners or troublemakers in the
classroom. Siblings and even parents may develop
resentful feelings towards the ADHD child.
Some ADHD children also develop a conduct
disorder problem. For those adolescents who have
both ADHD and a conduct disorder, as many as 25%
go on to develop antisocial personality disorder and
the criminal behavior, substance abuse, and high rate
of suicide attempts that are symptomatic of it.
Children diagnosed with ADHD are also more likely
to have a learning disorder, a mood disorder such as
depression, or an anxiety disorder.
Approximately 70-80% of ADHD patients treated with stimulant medication experience significant
relief from symptoms, at least in the short-term.
Approximately one-half of ADHD children seem to
‘‘outgrow’’ the disorder in adolescence or early adulthood; the other half will retain some or all symptoms
of ADHD as adults. With early identification and
intervention, careful compliance with a treatment

I Audiometry
Definition
Audiometry is the testing of a person’s ability to
hear various sound frequencies. The test is performed
with the use of electronic equipment called an audiometer. This testing is usually administered by a trained
technician called an audiologist.

Purpose
Audiometry testing is used to identify and diagnose hearing loss. The equipment is used in health
screening programs, for example in grade schools, to
detect hearing problems in children. It is also used in
the doctor’s office or hospital audiology department
to diagnose hearing problems in children, adults, and

the elderly. With correct diagnosis of a person’s specific pattern of hearing impairment, the right type of
therapy, which might include hearing aids, corrective
surgery, or speech therapy, can be prescribed.

Precautions
Testing with audiometry equipment is simple and
painless. No special precautions are required.

Description
A trained audiologist (a specialist in detecting
hearing loss) uses an audiometer to conduct audiometry testing. This equipment emits sounds or tones, like
musical notes, at various frequencies, or pitches, and
at differing volumes or levels of loudness. Testing is
usually done in a soundproof testing room.
The person being tested wears a set of headphones that blocks out other distracting sounds and
delivers a test tone to one ear at a time. At the sound
of a tone, the patient holds up a hand or finger to
indicate that the sound is detected. The audiologist
lowers the volume and repeats the sound until the
patient can no longer detect it. This process is
repeated over a wide range of tones or frequencies
from very deep, low sounds, like the lowest note
played on a tuba, to very high sounds, like the
pinging of a triangle. Each ear is tested separately.
It is not unusual for levels of sensitivity to sound to
differ from one ear to the other.
A second type of audiometry testing uses a headband rather than headphones. The headband is worn
with small plastic rectangles that fit behind the ears to

KEY TERMS
Audiogram—A chart or graph of the results of a hearing test conducted with audiographic equipment. The
chart reflects the softest (lowest volume) sounds that
can be heard at various frequencies or pitches.
Decibel—A unit of measure for expressing the
loudness of a sound. Normal speech is typically
spoken in the range of about 20-50 decibels.

canal and eardrum.

conduct sound through the bones of the skull. The
patient being tested senses the tones that are transmitted as vibrations through the bones to the inner
ear. As with the headphones, the tones are repeated at
various frequencies and volumes.
The results of the audiometry test may be recorded
on a grid or graph called an audiogram. This graph is
generally set up with low frequencies or tones at one end
and high ones at the other end, much like a piano keyboard. Low notes are graphed on the left and high notes
on the right. The graph also charts the volume of the
tones used; from soft, quiet sounds at the top of the
chart to loud sounds at the bottom. Hearing is measured in units called decibels. Most of the sounds associated with normal speech patterns are generally spoken
in the range of 20-50 decibels. An adult with normal
hearing can detect tones between 0-20 decibels.
Speech audiometry is another type of testing that
uses a series of simple recorded words spoken at various volumes into headphones worn by the patient
being tested. The patient repeats each word back to
the audiologist as it is heard. An adult with normal
hearing will be able to recognize and repeat 90-100%
of the words.

Preparation
The ears may be examined with an otoscope prior
to audiometry testing to determine if there are any
blockages in the ear canal due to ear wax or other
material.

Normal results
A person with normal hearing will be able to
recognize and respond to all of the tone frequencies
460

administered at various volumes in both ears by the
audiometry test. An adult with normal hearing can
detect a range of low and high pitched sounds that
are played as softly as between nearly 0-20 decibels.
Normal speech is generally spoken in the range of
20-50 decibels.

Abnormal results
Audiometry test results are considered abnormal
if there is a significant or unexplained difference
between the levels of sound heard between the two
ears, or if the person being tested is unable to hear in
the normal range of frequencies and volume. The
pattern of responses displayed on the audiogram can
be used by the audiologist to identify if a significant
hearing loss is present and if the patient might benefit
from hearing aids or corrective surgery.

I Auditory integration training
Definition
Auditory integration training, or AIT, is one specific type of music/auditory therapy based upon the
work of French otolaryngologists Dr. Alfred Tomatis
and Dr. Guy Berard.

Origins
The premise upon which most auditory integration programs are based is that distortion in how
things are heard contributes to commonly seen
behavioral or learning disorders in children. Some
of these disorders include attention deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD), autism, dyslexia, and central
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

parents’ fellow opera singers. From these experiences with
the sound of music, he developed the principle that has
come to be known as the Tomatis Effect, i.e. that the human
voice can only sing what it hears.
Tomatis has been called the Einstein of the ear. It was
his research that made the world aware that the ears of an
infant in utero are already functioning at four and half
months of age. Just as the umbilical cord provides nourishment to the unborn infant’s body, Tomatis postulated that
the sound of the mother’s voice is also a nutrient heard by
the fetus. This sound literally charges and stimulates the
growth of the brain.

Internationally renowned French otolaryngologist,
psychologist, educator and inventor Alfred Tomatis perceived the importance of sound and hearing early in
his career. He took his degree as a Doctor of Medicine
from the University of Paris and specialized in ear,
nose and throat medicine. The son of two opera singers, Tomatis early in his career treated some of his

auditory processing disorders (CAPD). Training the
patient to listen can stimulate central and cortical
organization.
Auditory integration is one facet of what audiologists call central auditory processing. The simplest
definition of central auditory processing, or CAP, is
University of Buffalo Professor of Audiology Jack
Katz’s, which is: ‘‘What we do with what we hear.’’
Central auditory integration is actually the perception
of sound, including the ability to attend to sound, to
remember it, retaining it in both the long- and shortterm memory, to be able to listen to sound selectively,
and to localize it.
Guy Berard developed one of the programs commonly used. Berard’s auditory integration training
consists of twenty half-hour sessions spent listening
to musical sounds via a stereophonic system. The
music is random, with filtered frequencies, and the
person listens through earphones. These sound waves
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Tomatis took this further, into the realm of language.
Tomatis concluded that the need to communicate and to
be understood are among our most basic needs. He was a
pioneer in perceiving that language problems convert into
social problems for people. ‘‘Language is what characterizes man and makes him different from other creatures,’’
Tomatis is quoted as saying. The techniques he developed
to teach people how to listen effectively are internationally
respected tools used in the treatment of autism, attentiondeficit disorder, and other learning disabilities.
His listening program, the invention of the Electronic
Ear, and his work with the therapeutic use of sound and
music for the past fifty years have made Tomatis arguably
the best known and most successful ear specialist in the
world. There are more than two hundred Tomatis Centers
worldwide, treating a vast variety of problems related to
the ability to hear.

vibrate and exercise structures in the middle ear. This
is normally done in sessions twice a day for 10 days.
Alfred Tomatis is also the inventor of the
Electronic Ear. This device operates through a series
of filters, and reestablishes the dominance of the right
ear in hearing. The basis of Tomatis’ work is a series of
principles that follow:


The most important purpose of the ear is to adapt
sound waves into signals that charge the brain.



Sound is conducted via both air and bone. It can be
considered something that nourishes the nervous
system, either stimulating or destimulating it.



Just as seeing is not the same as looking, hearing is not
the same as listening. Hearing is passive. Listening is
active.



A person’s ability to listen affects all language development for that person. This process influences every
aspect of self-image and social development.
461

Auditory integration training

A L F R E D T O M A T I S (1920– )

Auditory integration training



The capacity to listen can be changed or improved
through auditory stimulation using musical and
vocal sounds at high frequencies.



Communication begins in the womb. As early as the
beginning of the second trimester, fetuses can hear
sounds. These sounds literally cause the brain and
nervous system of the baby to develop.

Description
A quartet of CAP defects have been identified that
can unfavorably alter how each person processes
sound. Among these are:


Phonetic decoding, a problem that occurs when the
brain incorrectly decodes what is being heard.
Sounds are unrecognizable, often because the person
speaking talks too fast.



Tolerance-fading memory, a condition with little or
poor tolerance for background sounds.



Auditory integration involves a person’s ability to
put together things heard with things seen.
Characteristically there are long response delays
and trouble with phonics, or recognizing the symbols
for sounds.



The fourth problem area, often called auditory organization, overlaps the previous three. It is characterized by disorganization in handling auditory and
other information.

Certain audiological tests are carried out to see if
the person has a CAP problem, and if so, how severe it
is. Other tests give more specific information regarding the nature of the CAP problem. They include:


Puretone air-conduction threshold testing, which measures peripheral hearing loss. If loss is found, then
bone-conduction testing, or evaluation of the vibration of small bones in the inner ear, is also carried out.



Word discrimination scores (WDS) determines a person’s clarity in hearing ideal speech. This is done by
presenting 25–50 words at 40 decibels above the
person’s average sound threshold in each ear. Test
scores equal the percentage of words heard correctly.



Immittance testing is made up of two parts, assessing
the status of, and the protective mechanisms of the
middle ear.



Staggered sporadic word (SSW) testing delivers 40
compound words in an overlapping way at 50 decibels above threshold to each ear of the person being
tested. This test provides expanded information that
makes it possible to break down CAP problems into
the four basic types.

462



Speech in noise discrimination (SN) testing is similar
to Staggered Sporadic Word testing except that other
noise is also added and the percentage correct in
quiet is compared with that correct when there is
added noise.



Phonemic synthesis (PS) determines serious learning
problems. The types of errors made in sounding out
written words or associating written letters with the
sounds they represent help in determining the type
and severity of CAP problems.

Purpose
Upon completion of an auditory integration
training program, the person’s hearing should be capable of perceiving all frequencies at, or near, the same
level. Total improvement from this therapy, in both
hearing and behavior, can take up to one year.

Research and general acceptance
Auditory integration training is based upon newly
learned information about the brain. Though brain
structures and connections are predetermined, probably by heredity, another factor called plasticity also
comes into play. Learning, we now know, continues
from birth to death. Plasticity is the ability of the brain
to actually change its structuring and connections
through the process of learning.
Problems with auditory processing are now
viewed as having a wide–reaching ripple effect on our
society. It is estimated that 30–40% of children starting school have language-learning skills that can be
described as poor. CAP difficulties are a factor in
several different learning disabilities. They affect not
only academic success, but also nearly every aspect of
societal difficulties. One example to illustrate this is a
1989 University of Buffalo study where CAP problems
were found to be present in a surprising 97% of youth
inmates in an upstate New York corrections facility.

Definition
Autism is a severe disorder of brain function
marked by problems with social contact, intelligence
and language, together with ritualistic or compulsive
behavior and bizarre responses to the environment.

Description
Autism is a lifelong disorder that interferes with
the ability to understand what is seen, heard, and
touched. This can cause profound problems in personal behavior and in the ability to relate to others. A
person with autism must learn how to communicate
normally and how to relate to people, objects and
events. However, not all patients suffer the same
degree of impairment. There is a full spectrum of
symptoms, which can range from mild to severe.
Autism occurs in as many as one or two per 1,000
children. It is found four times more often in boys
(usually the first-born) and occurs around the world
in all races and social backgrounds. Autism usually is
evident in the first three years of life, although in some
children it’s hard to tell when the problem develops.
Sometimes the condition isn’t diagnosed until the
child enters school.
While a person with autism can have symptoms
ranging from mild to severe, about 10% have an
extraordinary ability in one area, such as in mathematics, memory, music, or art. Such children are
known as ‘‘autistic savants’’ (formerly known as
‘‘idiot savants.’’).

Causes and symptoms
Autism is a brain disorder that affects the way the
brain uses or transmits information. Studies have
found abnormalities in several parts of the brain that
almost certainly occurred during fetal development.
The problem may be centered in the parts of the
brain responsible for processing language and information from the senses.
There appears to be a strong genetic basis for
autism. Identical twins are more likely to both be
affected than twins who are fraternal (not genetically
identical). In a family with one autistic child, the
chance of having another child with autism is about
1 in 20, much higher than in the normal population.
Sometimes, relatives of an autistic child have mild
behaviors that look very much like autism, such as
repetitive behaviors and social or communication
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

At least one group of researchers has found a link
between an abnormal gene and autism. The gene may
be just one of at least three to five genes that interact in
some way to cause the condition. Scientists suspect
that a faulty gene or genes might make a person vulnerable to develop autism in the presence of other
factors, such as a chemical imbalance, viruses or chemicals, or a lack of oxygen at birth.
In a few cases, autistic behavior is caused by a
disease such as:


rubella in the pregnant mother



tuberous sclerosis



fragile X syndrome



encephalitis



untreated phenylketonuria

The severity of the condition varies between individuals, ranging from the most severe (extremely unusual, repetitive, self- injurious, and aggressive
behavior) to very mild, resembling a personality disorder with some learning disability.
Profound problems with social interaction are the
most common symptoms of autism. Infants with the
disorder won’t cuddle; they avoid eye contact and
don’t seem to want or need physical contact or affection. They may become rigid or flaccid when they are
held, cry when picked up, and show little interest in
human contact. Such a child doesn’t smile or lift his
arms in anticipation of being picked up. He forms no
attachment to parents nor shows any normal anxiety
toward strangers. He doesn’t learn typical games of
childhood, such as peek-a-boo.
Language problems
The child with autism may not speak at all; if he
does, it is often in single words. He may endlessly
repeat words or phrases that are addressed to him
and may reverse pronouns (‘‘You go sleep’’ instead
of ‘‘I want to go to sleep’’).
Restricted interests and activity
Usually a child with autism has many problems
playing normally. He probably won’t act out adultroles
during play time, and instead of enjoying fantasy play,
he may simply repeatedly mimic the actions of someone
else. Bizarre behavior patterns are very common among
autistic children and may include complex rituals,
screaming fits, rhythmic rocking, arm flapping, finger

problems. Research also has found that some emotional disorders (such as manic depression) occur
more often in families of a child with autism.

twiddling, and crying without tears. Autistic children
may play with their own saliva, feces or urine.They
may be self-destructive, biting their own hands, gouging
at their eyes, pulling their hair, or banging their head.
Sensory problems
The sensory world poses a real problem to many
autistic children, who seem overwhelmed by their own
senses. A child with autism may ignore objects or become
obsessed with them, continually watching the object
or the movement of his fingers over it. Many of these
children may react to sounds by banging their head
or flapping fingers. Some high-functioning autistic
adults who have written books about their childhood
experiences report that sounds were often excruciatingly
painful to them, forcing them to withdraw from their
environment or try to cope by withdrawing into their
own world of sensation and movement.
Intellectual problems
Most autistic children appear to be moderately
mentally retarded. They may giggle or cry for no
464

reason, have no fear of real danger, but exhibit terror
of harmless objects.

Diagnosis
There is no medical test for autism. Because the
symptoms of autism are so varied, the condition may
go undiagnosed for some time (especially in those with
mild cases or if other handicaps are also present).
It may be confused with other diseases, such as fragile
X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and untreated
phenylketonuria.
Autism is diagnosed by observing the child’s
behavior, communication skills, and social interactions. Medical tests should rule out other possible
causes of autistic symptoms. Criteria that mental
health experts use to diagnose autism include:


problems with developing friendships



problems with make-believe or social play



endlessly repeated words or strings of words



difficulty in carrying on a conversation

Antidepressants—A type of medication that is used
to treat depression; it is also sometimes used to treat
autism.
Asperger syndrome—Children who have autistic
behavior but no problems with language.
Encephalitis—A rare inflammation of the brain
caused by a viral infection. It has been linked to
the develoment of autism.
Fragile X syndrome—A genetic condition related to
the X chromosome that affects mental, physical and
sensory development.
Major tranquilizers—The family of drugs that
includes the psychotropic or neuroleptic drugs,
sometimes used to help autistic people. They carry
significant risk of side effects, including Parkinsonism
and movement disorders, and should be prescribed
with caution.
Opiate blockers—A type of drug that blocks the
effects of natural opiates in the system. This
makes some people, including some people with
autism, appear more responsive to their
environment.
Phenylketonuria (PKU)—An enzyme deficiency
present at birth that disrupts metabolism and causes
brain damage. This rare inherited defect may be
linked to the development of autism.
Rubella—Also known as German measles. When a
woman contracts rubella during pregnancy, her
developing infant may be damaged. One of the
problems that may result is autism.
Stimulants—A class of drugs, including Ritalin,
used to treat people with autism. They may make
children calmer and better able to concentrate, but
they also may limit growth or have other side
effects.
Tuberous sclerosis—A genetic disease that causes
skin problems, seizures, and mental retardation. It
may be confused with autism.



obsessions with rituals or restricted patterns

Some children have a few of the symptoms of
autism, but not enough to be diagnosed with the
‘‘classical’’ form of the condition. Children who have
autistic behavior but no problems with language may
be diagnosed with ‘‘Asperger syndrome.’’ Children
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

who seem normal at first but who begin to show
autistic behavior as they get older might be diagnosed
with ‘‘childhood disintegrative disorder’’ (CDD).
These problems are sometimes called ‘‘autistic spectrum disorders.’’ It is also important to rule out other
problems that seem similar to autism.

Treatment
There is no cure for autism. Treatments are
aimed at reducing specific symptoms. Because the
symptoms vary so widely from one person to the
next, there is not a single approach that works for
every person. A spectrum of interventions include
training in music, listening, vision, speech and language, and senses. Special diets and medications may
also be prescribed.
Studies show that people with autism can improve
significantly with proper treatment. A child with autism can learn best with special teachers in a
structured program that emphasizes individual
instruction. The two most-often studied types of treatment are:
Educational or behavioral treatment
Typically, behavioral techniques are used to help
the child respond and decrease symptoms. This might
include positive reinforcement (food and rewards) to
boost language and social skills. This training includes
structured, skill-oriented instruction designed to boost
social and language abilities. Training needs to begin
as early as possible, since early intervention appears to
influence brain development.
Most experts believe that modern treatment is
most effective when carried out at home, although
treatment may also take place in a psychiatric hospital, specialized school, or day care program.
Medication
No single medication has yet proved highly effective for the major features of autism. However, a
variety of drugs can control self-injurious, aggressive,
and other of the more difficult behaviors. Drugs also
can control epilepsy, which afflicts up to 20% of people with autism.
Five types of drugs are sometimes prescribed to
help the behavior problems of people with autism:

stimulants, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin)

antidepressants, such as fluroxamine (Luvox)

Today, most experts recommend a complex treatment regimen that begins early and continues through
the teenage years. Behavioral therapies are used in
conjunction with medications.

Alternative treatment
Many parents report success with megavitamin
therapy. Some studies have shown that vitamin B6
improves eye contact and speech and lessens tantrum
behavior. Vitamin B6 causes fewer side effects than
other medications and is considered safe when used
in appropriate doses. However, not many health practitioners advocate its use in the treatment of autism,
citing that the studies showing its benefit were flawed.
DMG (dimethylglycine)
This compound, available in many health food
stores, is legally classified as a food, not a vitamin or
drug. Some researchers claim that it improves speech
in children with autism. Those who respond to this
treatment will usually do so within a week. Again,
many doctors do not feel that the studies are adequate
to promote this treatment.

Prognosis
While there is no cure, with appropriate treatment
the negative behaviors of autism may improve. Earlier
generations placed autistic children in institutions;
today, even severely disabled children can be helped in
a less restrictive environment to develop to their highest
potential. Many can eventually become more responsive to others as they learn to understand the world
around them, and some can lead nearly normal lives.
People with autism have a normal life expectancy.
Some people with autism can handle a job; they do
best with structured jobs that involve a degree of
repetition.

Definition
Autoimmune disorders are conditions in which a
person’s immune system attacks the body’s own cells,
causing tissue destruction.

Description
Autoimmunity is accepted as the cause of a wide
range of disorders, and it is suspected to be responsible
for many more. Autoimmune diseases are classified as
either general, in which the autoimmune reaction
takes place simultaneously in a number of tissues, or
organ specific, in which the autoimmune reaction targets a single organ.

Prevention
Until the cause of autism is discovered, prevention
is not possible.
466

Autoimmune disorders include the following:


Systemic lupus erythematosus. A general autoimmune disease in which antibodies attack a number
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE







Rheumatoid arthritis. Occurs when the immune system attacks and destroys the tissues that line bone
joints and cartilage. The disease occurs throughout
the body, although some joints may be more affected
than others.
Goodpasture’s syndrome. Occurs when antibodies
are deposited in the membranes of both the lung
and kidneys, causing both inflammation of kidney
glomerulus (glomerulonephritis) and lung bleeding. It
is typically a disease of young males.
Grave’s disease. Caused by an antibody that binds to
specific cells in the thyroid gland, causing them to
make excessive amounts of thyroid hormone.



Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Caused by an antibody that
binds to cells in the thyroid gland. Unlike in Grave’s
disease, however, this antibody’s action results in less
thyroid hormone being made.



Pemphigus vulgaris. A group of autoimmune disorders that affect the skin.



Myasthenia gravis. A condition in which the immune
system attacks a receptor on the surface of muscle
cells, preventing the muscle from receiving nerve
impulses and resulting in severe muscle weakness.



Scleroderma. Also called CREST syndrome or progressive systemic sclerosis, scleroderma affects the
connective tissue.



Autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Occurs when the
body produces antibodies that coat red blood cells.



Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Disorder
in which the immune system targets and destroys
blood platelets.



Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis. Immune disorders that affect the neuromuscular system.



Pernicious anemia. Disorder in which the immune
system attacks the lining of the stomach in such a
way that the body cannot metabolize vitamin B12.



Sjögren’s syndrome. Occurs when the exocrine
glands are attacked by the immune system, resulting
in excessive dryness.



Ankylosing spondylitis. Immune system induced
degeneration of the joints and soft tissue of the spine.



Vasculitis. A group of autoimmune disorders in
which the immune system attacks and destroys
blood vessels.



Type I diabetes mellitus. May be caused by an antibody that attacks and destroys the islet cells of the
pancreas, which produce insulin.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



Amyotrophic lateral schlerosis. Also called Lou
Gehrig’s disease. An immune disorder that causes
the death of neurons which leads to progressive loss
of muscular control.



Guillain-Barre syndrome. Also called infectious
polyneuritis. Often occurring after an infection or
an immunization (specifically Swine flu), the disease
affects the myelin sheath, which coats nerve cells. It
causes progressive muscle weakness and paralysis.



Multiple sclerosis. An autoimmune disorder that may
involve a virus affects the central nervous system,
causing loss of coordination and muscle control.

Causes and symptoms
To further understand autoimmune disorders, it is
helpful to understand the workings of the immune
system. The purpose of the immune system is to defend
the body against attack by infectious microbes (germs)
and foreign objects. When the immune system attacks
an invader, it is very specific—a particular immune
system cell will only recognize and target one type of
invader. To function properly, the immune system must
not only develop this specialized knowledge of individual invaders, but it must also learn how to recognize
and not destroy cells that belong to the body itself.
Every cell carries protein markers on its surface that
identifies it in one of two ways: what kind of cell it is
(e.g. nerve cell, muscle cell, blood cell, etc.) and to
whom that cell belongs. These markers are called
major histocompatability complexes (MHCs). When
functioning properly, cells of the immune system will
not attack any other cell with markers identifying it as
belonging to the body. Conversely, if the immune system cells do not recognize the cell as ‘‘self,’’ they attach
themselves to it and put out a signal that the body has
been invaded, which in turn stimulates the production
of substances such as antibodies that engulf and destroy
the foreign particles. In case of autoimmune disorders,
the immune system cannot distinguish between ‘‘self’’
cells and invader cells. As a result, the same destructive
operation is carried out on the body’s own cells that
would normally be carried out on bacteria, viruses, and
other such harmful entities.
The reasons why immune systems become dysfunctional in this way is not well understood.
However, most researchers agree that a combination
of genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors
play into autoimmunity. Researchers also speculate
that certain mechanisms may trigger autoimmunity.
First, a substance that is normally restricted to one
part of the body, and therefore not usually exposed
to the immune system, is released into other areas
467

of different tissues. The disease recurs periodically
and is seen mainly in young and middle-aged women.

Autoimmune disorders



Myasthenia gravis. Characterized by fatigue and muscle weakness that at first may be confined to certain
muscle groups, but then may progress to the point of
paralysis. Myasthenia gravis patients often have
expressionless faces as well as difficulty chewing and
swallowing. If the disease progresses to the respiratory
system, artificial respiration may be required.



Scleroderma. Disorder is usually preceded by
Raynaud’s phenomenon. Symptoms that follow
include pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints,
and the skin takes on a tight, shiny appearance. The
digestive system also becomes involved, resulting in
weight loss, appetite loss, diarrhea, constipation, and
distention of the abdomen. As the disease progresses,
the heart, lungs, and kidneys become involved, and
malignant hypertension causes death in approximately 30% of cases.



Autoimmune hemolytic anemia. May be acute or
chronic. Symptoms include fatigue and abdominal
tenderness due to an enlarged spleen.



Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Characterized by pinhead-size red dots on the skin, unexplained
bruises, bleeding from the nose and gums, and blood in
the stool.



Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis. In polymyositis,
symptoms include muscle weakness, particularly in
the shoulders or pelvis, that prevents the patient from
performing everyday activities. In dermatomyositis,
the same muscle weakness is accompanied by a rash
that appears on the upper body, arms, and fingertips.
A rash may also appear on the eyelids, and the area
around the eyes may become swollen.



Pernicious anemia. Signs of pernicious anemia
include weakness, sore tongue, bleeding gums, and
tingling in the extremities. Because the disease causes
a decrease in stomach acid, nausea, vomiting, loss of
appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, and constipation are
possible. Also, because Vitamin B12 is essential for
the nervous system function, the deficiency of it
brought on by the disease can result in a host of
neurological problems, including weakness, lack of
coordination, blurred vision, loss of fine motor skills,
loss of the sense of taste, ringing in the ears, and loss
of bladder control.



Sjögren’s syndrome. Characterized by excessive dryness of the mouth and eyes.



Ankylosing spondylitis. Generally begins with lower
back pain that progresses up the spine. The pain may
eventually become crippling.



Vasculitis. Symptoms depend upon the group of
veins affected and can range greatly.

where it is attacked. Second, the immune system
may mistake a component of the body for a similar
foreign component. Third, cells of the body may be
altered in some way, either by drugs, infection, or
some other environmental factor, so that they are
no longer recognizable as ‘‘self’’ to the immune
system. Fourth, the immune system itself may be
damaged, such as by a genetic mutation, and therefore cannot function properly.
The symptoms of the above disorders include:




Systemic lupus erythematosus. Symptoms include
fever, chills, fatigue, weight loss, skin rashes (particularly the classic ‘‘butterfly’’ rash on the face), vasculitis, polyarthralgia, patchy hair loss, sores in the mouth
or nose, lymph-node enlargement, gastric problems,
and, in women, irregular periods. About half of those
who suffer from lupus develop cardiopulmonary problems, and some may also develop urinary problems.
Lupus can also effect the central nervous system,
causing seizures, depression, and psychosis.
Rheumatoid arthritis. Initially may be characterized
by a low-grade fever, loss of appetite, weight loss,
and a generalized pain in the joints. The joint pain
then becomes more specific, usually beginning in the
fingers, then spreading to other areas, such as the
wrists, elbows, knees, and ankles. As the disease
progresses, joint function diminishes sharply and
deformities occur, particularly the characteristic
‘‘swan’s neck’’ curling of the fingers.



Goodpasture’s syndrome. Symptoms are similar to
that of iron deficiency anemia, including fatigue and
pallor. Symptoms involving the lungs may range
from a cough that produces bloody sputum to outright hemorrhaging. Symptoms involving the urinary system include blood in the urine and/or swelling.



Grave’s disease. This disease is characterized by an
enlarged thyroid gland, weight loss without loss of
appetite, sweating, heart palpitations, nervousness,
and an inability to tolerate heat.



Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. This disorder generally displays no symptoms.



Pemphigus vulgaris. This disease is characterized by
blisters and deep lesions on the skin.

468

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Type I diabetes mellitus. Characterized by fatigue
and an abnormally high level of glucose in the
blood (hyperglycemia).



Amyotrophic lateral schlerosis. First signs are stumbling and difficulty climbing stairs. Later, muscle
cramps and twitching may be observed as well as
weakness in the hands making fastening buttons or
turning a key difficult. Speech may become slowed or
slurred. There may also be difficluty swallowing. As
respiratory muscles atrophy, there is increased danger of aspiration or lung infection.



Guillain-Barre syndrome. Muscle weakness in the legs
occurs first, then the arms and face. Paresthesias (a
prickly, tingling sensation) is also felt. This disorder
affects both sides of the body and may involve paralysis and the muscles that control breathing.



Multiple sclerosis. Like Lou Gehrig’s disease, the
first symptom may be clumsiness. Weakness or
exhaustion is often reported, as well as blurry or
double vision. There may be dizziness, depression,
loss of bladder control, and muscle weakness so
severe that the patient is confined to a wheelchair.

Diagnosis
A number of tests are involved in the diagnosis
of autoimmune diseases, depending on the particular
disease; e.g. blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid analysis,
electromylogram (measures muscle function), and
magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Usually,
these tests determine the location and extent of
damage or involvement. They are useful in charting
progress of the disease and as baselines for
treatment.
The principle tool, however, for authenticating
autoimmune disease is antibody testing. Such tests
involve measuring the level of antibodies found in
the blood and determining if they react with specific
antigens that would give rise to an autoimmune reaction. An elevated amount of antibodies indicates that
a humoral immune reaction is occurring. Since elevated antibody levels are also seen in common infections, they must be ruled out as the cause for the
increased antibody levels.
Antibodies can also be typed by class. There are
five classes of antibodies, and they can be separated in
the laboratory. The class IgG is usually associated
with autoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, IgG class
antibodies are also the main class of antibody seen in
normal immune responses.
The most useful antibody tests involve introducing the patient’s antibodies to samples of his or her
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

own tissue, usually thyroid, stomach, liver, and kidney
tissue. If antibodies bind to the ‘‘self’’ tissue, it is
diagnostic for an autoimmune disorder. Antibodies
from a person without an autoimmune disorder
would not react to ‘‘self ’’ tissue.

Treatment
Treatment of autoimmune diseases is specific to
the disease, and usually concentrates on alleviating or
preventing symptoms rather than correcting the
underlying cause. For example, if a gland involved in
an autoimmune reaction is not producing a hormone
such as insulin, administration of that hormone is
required. Administration of a hormone, however,
will restore the function of the gland damaged by the
autoimmune disease.
The other aspect of treatment is controlling the
inflammatory and proliferative nature of the immune
response. This is generally accomplished with two
types of drugs. Steroid compounds are used to control
inflammation. There are many different steroids, each
having side effects. The proliferative nature of the
immune response is controlled with immunosuppressive drugs. These drugs work by inhibiting the replication of cells and, therefore, also suppress non-immune
cells leading to side effects such as anemia.
Systemic enzyme therapy is a new treatment that is
showing results for rheumatoid arthritis, multiple
sclerosis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other inflammatory diseases. Enzymes combinations of pancreatin,
trypsin, chymotrypsin, bromelain, and papain help
stimulate the body’s own defenses, accelerate inflammation in order to reduce swelling and improve circulation, and break up the immune complexes within the
bloodstream. Symptoms have been reduced using this
treatment.
Other treatments that hold some promise are irradiation of the spleen and gene therapy. Splenic irradiation is touted to be a safe, alternative for patients with
autoimmune blood diseases, especially autoimmune
hemolytic anemia, or others with compromised
immune systems, such as HIV patients and the elderly.
It is reported to have few side effects and seems to be
working. Cytokine and cytokine inhibitor genes
injected directly into muscle tissue also appear to be
effective in treating Type I diabetes mellitus, systemic
lupus erythematosus, thyroditis, and arthritis.

Prognosis
Prognosis depends upon the pathology of each
autoimmune disease.

Prevention
Most autoimmune diseases cannot be prevented.
Though the mechanisms involved in how these diseases affect the body are known, it is still unclear
why the body turns on itself. Since more women than
men seem to be affected by some of these disorders
(e.g. lupus), some researchers are looking into hormones as a factor. This, and gene therapy, may be
the preventatives of the future.

information to be used in the care of the living. When
foul play is suspected, a government coroner or medical

of medical study is called forensic medicine. Forensic
specialists investigate deaths resulting from violence

Description
An autopsy can be described as the examination
of a deceased human body with a detailed exam of
the person’s remains. This procedure dates back to
the Roman era when few human dissections were
performed; autopsies were utilized, however, to
determine the cause of death in criminal cases. At
the beginning of the procedure the exterior body is
examined and then the internal organs are removed
and studied. Some pathologists argue that more
autopsies are performed than necessary. However,
recent studies show that autopsies can detect major
findings about a person’s condition that were not
suspected when the person was alive. And the growing awareness of the influence of genetic factors in
disease has also emphasized the importance of
autopsies.
Despite the usefulness of autopsies, fewer autopsies have been performed in the United States during
the past 10-20 years. A possible reason for this decline
is concern about malpractice suits on the part of the
treating physician. Other possible reasons are that
hospitals are performing fewer autopsies because of
the expense or because modern technology, such as
CT scans and magnetic resonance imaging, can
often provide sufficient diagnostic information.
Nonetheless, federal regulators and pathology groups
have begun to establish new guidelines designed to
increase the number and quality of autopsies being
performed.
Many experts are concerned that if the number of
autopsies increases, hospitals may be forced to charge
families a fee for the procedure as autopies are not
normally covered by insurance companies or
Medicare. Yet, according to several pathologists, the
benefit of the procedure for families and doctors does
justify the cost. In medical autopsies, physicians
remain cautious to examine only as much of the
body as permitted according to the wishes of the
family. It is important to note that autopsies can also
provide peace of mind for the bereaved family in certain situations.

Preparation
If a medical autopsy is being performed, written
permission is secured from the family of the deceased
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Aftercare
Once the autopsy has been completed, the body is
prepared for final arrangements according to the
family’s wishes

Risks
There are some risks of disease transmission from
the deceased. In fact, some physicans may refuse to do
autopsies on specific patients because of a fear of
contracting diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis, or
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease.

Normal results
In most situations the cause of death is determined
from the procedure of an autopsy without any transmission of disease.

Abnormal results
Abnormal results would include inconclusive
results from the autopsy and transmission of infectious disease during the autopsy.

I Aviation medicine
Definition
Also known as aerospace medicine, flight medicine, or space medicine, aviation medicine is a medical specialty that focuses on the physical and
psychological conditions associated with flying and
space travel.

Purpose
Since flying airplanes and spacecraft involves
great risk and physical demands, such as changes in
gravity and oxygen, pilots and astronauts need medical experts to protect their safety and the public’s
safety.

and legal reasons. Some religious groups prohibit
autopsies.

KEY TERMS
G suits—Special flight suits, worn by fighter pilots,
which have compartments that fill with air or fluid
to keep blood from pooling in the lower body during rapid acceleration and tight turns.
Hypoxia—Hypoxia, or altitude sickness, reduces
the amount of oxygen in the brain causing such
symptoms as dizziness, shortness of breath, and
mental confusion.
Tympanic membrane—A structure in the middle
ear that can rupture if pressure in the ear is
not equalized during airplane ascents and
descents.
Valsalva Maneuver —Pilots grunt and tighten their
abdominal muscles to prevent black outs during
high-performance flying.

Description
Pressure changes
In the United States, the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) requires all pilots who fly
above 14,500 ft (4,420 m) to be prepared for pressure
changes caused by lower oxygen levels at high altitude.
Pilots must either have a pressurized cabin or access to
an oxygen mask. Without these protections, they
could experience hypoxia, or altitude sickness.
Hypoxia reduces the amount of oxygen in the brain,
causing such symptoms as dizziness, shortness of
breath, and mental confusion. These symptoms
could cause the pilot to lose control of the plane.
Hypoxia can be treated with oxygen therapy.
Rapid altitude increases and decreases can cause
pain because there is an air pocket in the middle portion of the ear. To equalize pressure in the ear, physicians typically advise pilots and passengers to clear
their sinuses by plugging their nose and blowing until
the eardrums ‘‘pop.’’ Other options include yawning,
swallowing or chewing gum. For people with a cold or
a severely blocked middle ear, the use of decongestants,
antihistamines, or nasal sprays may help. Without taking steps to equalize pressure, the tympanic membrane
could rupture, causing hearing loss, vertigo, dizziness,
and nausea.
Gravity’s impact
Fighter pilots who fly high-performance jets can
experience health problems during rapid acceleration
472

and when executing tight turns at high speed. During
these moves, a pilot experiences extreme gravity conditions that can pull blood away from the brain and
heart and into the lower body. This can cause the pilot
to have tunnel vision or pass out. To prevent these
potentially deadly situations, the military requires
fighter pilots to wear special flight suits, or G suits,
which have compartments that fill with air or fluid to
keep blood from pooling in the lower body.
Some pilots, like the Blue Angels, use a technique
called the Valsalva Maneuver instead of G suits to
prevent black outs during high-performance flying.
The Valsalva Maneuver involves grunting and tightening the abdominal muscles to stop blood from
collecting in the wrong parts of the body.
PREVENTIVE CARE. Since any routine health problem that affects a pilot could mean the loss of
hundreds of lives, aviation medicine specialists who
work for commercial airlines and the military take
special care to educate pilots about proper diet,
exercise and preventive health tools. For example,
physicians may frequently screen pilots for vision
changes caused by glaucoma or cataracts. They
also will check for hearing loss and encourage the
pilot to wear earplugs or headphones to buffer
engine noise. To monitor for heart disease, physicians will check blood pressure and may order diagnostic tests such as an ECG or stress test.

Motion sickness
Many people experience nausea, vertigo, and disorientation when they first arrive in space. This is
caused by changes in the fluid in the inner ear, which
is sensitive to gravity and affects our sense of spatial
orientation. The symptoms typically ease after several
days, but often recur when the astronaut returns to
Earth. To treat this condition, physicians give astronauts motion sickness medication, such as lorazepam.
Bone and muscle loss
In zero-gravity conditions, astronauts lose bone
and muscle mass. On earth, the natural resistance of
gravity helps build stronger muscles and bones during
normal weight-bearing activities like walking or even
sitting at a desk. In space, however, astronauts must
work harder to prevent bone and muscle loss. Exercise
is an important treatment. Crew members may use an
exercise cycle or resistive rubber bands to stay in
shape. Physicians also may give them medication to
prevent bone loss and prescribe nutritional supplements, such as a mixture of essential amino acids and
carbohydrates, to limit muscle atrophy.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Another health threat to space travelers is radiation. Harmful rays can alter the DNA in human cells
and cause cancer. Excess radiation also can weaken
the immune system. To prevent these problems, physicians may give astronauts nutritional supplements.
For example, research has show that n-3 fatty acids
found in fish oil reduce DNA damage.
Cardiovascular issues
When astronauts return to earth after a long mission, they tend to feel dizzy and black out. Scientists are
concerned about this dilemma because it could be dangerous if the crew members need to make an emergency
exit. One way to prevent this problem, which is caused
by a drop in blood pressure, is to have the astronauts
drink extra fluids and increase salt intake to increase
blood volume. Physicians also may prescribe medication
that causes blood vessels to contract. As another precaution, astronauts also put on protective flight suits, or
G suits, before they re-enter the earth’s atmosphere.

I Ayurvedic medicine
Definition
Ayurvedic medicine is a system of healing that originated in ancient India. In Sanskrit, ayur means life or
living, and veda means knowledge, so Ayurveda has been
defined as the ‘‘knowledge of living’’ or the ‘‘science of
longevity.’’ Ayurvedic medicine utilizes diet, detoxification and purification techniques, herbal and mineral
remedies, yoga, breathing exercises, meditation, and
massage therapy as holistic healing methods. Ayurvedic
medicine is widely practiced in modern India and has
been steadily gaining followers in the West.

Purpose
According to the original texts, the goal of
Ayurveda is prevention as well as promotion of the
body’s own capacity for maintenance and balance.
Ayurvedic treatment is non-invasive and non-toxic, so
it can be used safely as an alternative therapy or alongside conventional therapies. Ayurvedic physicians
claim that their methods can also help stress-related,
metabolic, and chronic conditions. Ayurveda has been
used to treat acne, allergies, asthma, anxiety, arthritis,
chronic fatigue syndrome, colds, colitis, constipation,
depression, diabetes, flu, heart disease, hypertension,
immune problems, inflammation, insomnia, nervous
disorders, obesity, skin problems, and ulcers.
Ayurvedic physicians seek to discover the roots
of a disease before it gets so advanced that more
radical treatments are necessary. Thus, Ayurveda
seems to be limited in treating severely advanced
conditions, traumatic injuries, acute pain, and conditions and injuries requiring invasive surgery.
Ayurvedic techniques have also been used alongside
chemotherapy and surgery to assist patients in
recovery and healing.

Description
Origins
Ayurvedic medicine originated in the early civilizations of India some 3,000-5,000 years ago. It is
mentioned in the Vedas, the ancient religious and
philosophical texts that are the oldest surviving literature in the world, which makes Ayurvedic medicine
the oldest surviving healing system. According to the
texts, Ayurveda was conceived by enlightened wise
men as a system of living harmoniously and maintaining the body so that mental and spiritual awareness
could be possible. Medical historians believe that

University and Boston University schools of medicine—
while establishing a very successful private practice. By
the time he was thirty-five, Chopra had become chief of
staff at New England Memorial Hospital.
Disturbed by Western medicine’s reliance on medication, he began a search for alternatives and discovered one
in the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, an Indian
spiritualist who had gained a cult following in the late sixties
teaching Transcendental Meditation (TM). Chopra began
practicing TM fervently and eventually met the Maharishi.
In 1985 Chopra established the Ayurvedic Health Center for
Stress Management and Behavioral Medicine in Lancaster,
Massachusetts, where he began his practice of integrating
the best aspects of Eastern and Western medicine.

(AP/Wide World Photos. Reproduced by permission.)

Deepak Chopra was born in India and studied medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Science. He left his
home for the United States in 1970 and completed residencies in internal medicine and endocrinology. He went
on to teaching posts at major medical institutions—Tufts

Ayurvedic ideas were transported from ancient India
to China and were instrumental in the development of
Chinese medicine.
Today, Ayurvedic medicine is used by 80% of the
population in India. Aided by the efforts of Deepak
Chopra and the Maharishi, it has become an increasingly accepted alternative medical treatment in
America during the last two decades. Chopra is an
M.D. who has written several bestsellers based on
Ayurvedic ideas. He also helped develop the Center
for Mind/Body Medicine in La Jolla, California, a
major Ayurvedic center that trains physicians in
Ayurvedic principles, produces herbal remedies, and
conducts research and documentation of its healing
techniques.
Key ideas
To understand Ayurvedic treatment, it is necessary
to have an idea how the Ayurvedic system views the
body. The basic life force in the body is prana, which is
also found in the elements and is similar to the Chinese
474

In 1993, he published Creating Affluence: Wealth
Consciousness in the Field of All Possibilities, and the enormously successful best seller, Ageless Body, Timeless Mind.
In the latter he presents his most radical thesis: that aging is
not the inevitable deterioration of organs and mind that we
have been traditionally taught to think of it as. It is a process
that can be influenced, slowed down, and even reversed
with the correct kinds of therapies, almost all of which are
self-administered or self-taught. He teaches that applying a
regimen of nutritional balance, meditation, and emotional
clarity characterized by such factors as learning to easily
and quickly express anger, for instance, can lead to
increased lifespans of up to 120 years.

notion of chi. As Swami Vishnudevananda, a yogi and
expert, put it, ‘‘Prana is in the air, but is not the oxygen,
nor any of its chemical constituents. It is in food, water,
and in the sunlight, yet it is not vitamin, heat, or lightrays. Food, water, air, etc., are only the media through
which the prana is carried.’’
In Ayurveda, there are five basic elements that
contain prana: earth, water, fire, air, and ether.
These elements interact and are further organized in
the human body as three main categories or basic
physiological principles in the body that govern all
bodily functions known as the doshas. The three
doshas are vata, pitta, and kapha. Each person has a
unique blend of the three doshas, known as the person’s prakriti, which is why Ayurvedic treatment is
always individualized. In Ayurveda, disease is viewed
as a state of imbalance in one or more of a person’s
doshas, and an Ayurvedic physician strives to adjust
and balance them, using a variety of techniques.
The vata dosha is associated with air and ether,
and in the body promotes movement and lightness.

Vata people are generally thin and light physically,

When vata is out of balance, there are often nervous
problems, hyperactivity, sleeplessness, lower back
pains, and headaches.
Pitta is associated with fire and water. In the body,
it is responsible for metabolism and digestion. Pitta
characteristics are medium-built bodies, fair skin,
strong digestion, and good mental concentration.
Pitta imbalances show up as anger and aggression
and stress-related conditions like gastritis, ulcers,
liver problems, and hypertension.
The kapha dosha is associated with water and
earth. People characterized as kapha are generally
large or heavy with more oily complexions. They
tend to be slow, calm, and peaceful. Kapha disorders
manifest emotionally as greed and possessiveness, and
physically as obesity, fatigue, bronchitis, and sinus
problems.
Diagnosis
In Ayurvedic medicine, disease is always seen as
an imbalance in the dosha system, so the diagnostic
process strives to determine which doshas are
underactive or overactive in a body. Diagnosis is
often taken over a course of days in order for the
Ayurvedic physician to most accurately determine
what parts of the body are being affected. To diagnose problems, Ayurvedic physicians often use
long questionnaires and interviews to determine a

person’s dosha patterns and physical and psychological histories. Ayurvedic physicians also intricately
observe the pulse, tongue, face, lips, eyes, and fingernails for abnormalities or patterns that they
believe can indicate deeper problems in the internal
systems. Some Ayurvedic physicians also use
laboratory tests to assist in diagnosis.
Treatment
Ayurvedic treatment seeks to re-establish balance
and harmony in the body’s systems. Usually the first
method of treatment involves some sort of detoxification and cleansing of the body, in the belief that accumulated toxins must be removed before any other
methods of treatment will be effective. Methods of
detoxification include therapeutic vomiting, laxatives,
medicated enemas, fasting, and cleansing of the
sinuses. Many Ayurvedic clinics combine all of these
cleansing methods into intensive sessions known as
panchakarma. Panchakarma can take several days or
even weeks and they are more than elimination therapies. They also include herbalized oil massage and
herbalized heat treatments. After purification,
Ayurvedic physicians use herbal and mineral remedies
to balance the body as well. Ayurvedic medicine contains a vast knowledge of the use of herbs for specific
health problems.
Ayurvedic medicine also emphasizes how people
live their lives from day to day, believing that proper
lifestyles and routines accentuate balance, rest, diet,
and prevention. Ayurveda recommends yoga as a
form of exercise to build strength and health, and
also advises massage therapy and self-massage as
ways of increasing circulation and reducing stress.
Yogic breathing techniques and meditation are also
part of a healthy Ayurvedic regimen, to reduce stress
and improve mental energy.

Of all treatments, though, diet is one of the most
basic and widely used therapy in the Ayurvedic system. An Ayurvedic diet can be a very well planned and
individualized regimen. According to Ayurveda, there
are six basic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter,
and astringent. Certain tastes and foods can either
calm or aggravate a particular dosha. For instance,
sweet, sour, and salty decrease vata problems and
increase kapha. Sour, salty, and pungent can increase
pitta. After an Ayurvedic physician determines a person’s dosha profile, they will recommend a specific
diet to correct imbalances and increase health. The
Ayurvedic diet emphasizes primarily vegetarian
foods of high quality and freshness, tailored to the
season and time of day. Cooling foods are eaten in
the summer and heating ones in the winter, always
within a person’s dosha requirements. In daily routine,
the heaviest meal of the day should be lunch, and
dinner should eaten well before bedtime, to allow for
complete digestion. Also, eating meals in a calm manner with proper chewing and state of mind is important, as is combining foods properly and avoiding
overeating.
Cost
Costs of Ayurvedic treatments can vary, with
initial consultations running anywhere from $40 to
over $100, with follow-up visits costing less. Herbal
treatments may cost from $10 to $50 per month, and
are often available from health food or bulk herb
stores. Some clinics offer panchakarma, the intensive
Ayurvedic detoxification treatment, which can include
overnight stays for up to several weeks. The prices for
these programs can vary significantly, depending on
the services and length of stay. Insurance reimbursement may depend on whether the primary physician is
a licensed M.D.

Preparations
Ayurveda is a mind/body system of health that
contains some ideas foreign to the Western scientific model. Those people considering Ayurveda
should approach it with an open mind and willingness to experiment. Also, because Ayurveda is a
whole-body system of healing and health, patience
and discipline are helpful, as some conditions and
diseases are believed to be brought on by years of
bad health habits and require time and effort to
correct. Finally, the Ayurvedic philosophy believes
that each person has the ability to heal themselves,
so those considering Ayurveda should be prepared
to bring responsibility and participation into the
treatment.
476

Precautions
An Ayurvedic practitioner should always be
consulted.

Side effects
During Ayurvedic detoxification programs, some
people report fatigue, muscle soreness, and general
sickness. Also, as Ayurveda seeks to release mental
stresses and psychological problems from the patient,
some people can experience mental disturbances and
depression during treatment, and psychological counseling may be part of a sound program.

Research and general acceptance
Because Ayurveda had been outside the Western
scientific system for years, research in the United
States is new. Another difficulty in documentation
arises because Ayurvedic treatment is very individualized; two people with the same disease but different
dosha patterns might be treated differently. Much
more scientific research has been conducted over the
past several decades in India. Much research in the
United States is being supported by the Maharishi
Ayur-Ved organization, which studies the Ayurvedic
products it sells and its clinical practices.
Some Ayurvedic herbal mixtures have been proven to have high antioxidant properties, much stronger than vitamins A, C, and E, and some have also
been shown in laboratory tests to reduce or eliminate
tumors in mice and to inhibit cancer growth in human
lung tumor cells. In a 1987 study at MIT, an Ayurvedic
herbal remedy was shown to significantly reduce colon
cancer in rats. Another study was performed in the
Netherlands with Maharishi Ayur-Ved products. A
group of patients with chronic illnesses, including
asthma, chronic bronchitis, hypertension, eczema,
psoriasis, constipation, rheumatoid arthritis, headaches, and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus,
were given Ayurvedic treatment. Strong results were
observed, with nearly 80% of the patients improving
and some chronic conditions being completely cured.
Other studies have shown that Ayurvedic therapies
can significantly lower cholesterol and blood pressure in
stress-related problems. Diabetes, acne, and allergies
have also been successfully treated with Ayurvedic remedies. Ayurvedic products have been shown to increase
short-term memory and reduce headaches. Also,
Ayurvedic remedies have been used successfully to support the healing process of patients undergoing chemotherapy, as these remedies have been demonstrated
to increase immune system activity.

I Babesiosis
Definition
Babesiosis is an infection of red blood cells caused
by the single-celled parasite, Babesia microti, which is
spread to humans by a tick bite.

Description
Babesiosis is a rare, tick-transmitted disease that
is caused most often by the single-celled parasite
Babesia microti. By 1995, fewer than 500 cases of
babesiosis had been reported in the United States.
The disease occurs primarily in New England and
New York, especially on the coastal islands.
However, cases have occurred in other parts of the
United States. Because of tick activity, the risk for
babesiosis is highest during June and July.
Ticks are small, blood-sucking arachnids.
Although some ticks carry diseasecausing organisms,
most do not. Babesia microti is spread to humans
through the bite of the tick Ixodes scapularis (also
called Ixodes dammini). Ixodes scapularis, called the
‘‘blacklegged deer tick,’’ usually feeds on deer and
mice. A tick picks up the parasites by feeding on an
infected mouse and then passes them on by biting a
new host, possibly a human. To pass on the parasites,
the tick must be attached to the skin for 36-48 hours.
Once in the bloodstream, Babesia microti enters a red
blood cell, reproduces by cell division, and destroys
the cell, causing anemia. Humans infected with
Babesia microti produce antibodies that can be helpful
in diagnosing the infection.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Causes and symptoms
Babesia microti live and divide within red blood
cells, destroying the cells and causing anemia. The
majority of people who are infected have no visible
symptoms. In those who become ill, symptoms appear
one to six weeks following the tick bite. Because the
ticks are small, many patients have no recollection of a
tick bite. The symptoms are flu-like and include tiredness, loss of appetite, fever, drenching sweats, and
muscle pain. Nausea, vomiting, headache, shaking
chills, blood in the urine, and depression can occur.
Persons who are over 40 years old, have had their
spleen removed (splenectomized), and/or have a serious disease (cancer, AIDS, etc.) are at a greater risk
for severe babesiosis. In severe cases of babesiosis, up
to 85% of the blood cells can be infected. This causes a
serious, possibly fatal, blood deficiency.

Diagnosis
Babesiosis can be diagnosed by examining a blood
sample microscopically and detecting the presence of
Babesia microti within the blood cells. The blood can
also be checked for the presence of antibodies to the
parasite.

Treatment
In serious cases, babesiosis is treated with a
combination of clindamycin (Cleocin) and quinine.
Clindamycin is given by injection and quinine is given
orally three to four times a day for four to seven days.
To reduce the number of parasites in the blood, severely
ill patients have been treated with blood transfusions.

Prognosis
Otherwise healthy patients will recover completely. Babesiosis may last several months without

Prevention
The only prevention for babesiosis is to minimize
exposure to ticks by staying on trails when walking
through the woods, avoiding tall grasses, wearing long
sleeves and tucking pant legs into socks, wearing insect
repellent, and checking for ticks after an outing.
Remove a tick as soon as possible by grasping the
tick with tweezers and gently pulling. Splenectomized
people should avoid northeastern coastal regions
during the tick season.

I Bacillary angiomatosis
Definition
A life-threatening but curable infection that
causes an eruption of purple lesions on or under the
skin that resemble Kaposi’s sarcoma. The infection,
which occurs almost exclusively in patients with
AIDS, can be a complication of cat-scratch disease.

Description
Bacillary angiomatosis is a re-emerging bacterial
infection that is identical or closely related to one
which commonly afflicted thousands of soldiers during
World War I. Today, the disease, caused by two versions of the same bacteria, is linked to homeless AIDS
patients and to those afflicted with cat-scratch disease.
480

The infection is rarely seen today in patients who
don’t have HIV. According to the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an HIV
patient diagnosed with bacillary angiomatosis is considered to have progressed to full-blown AIDS.

Causes and symptoms
Scientists have recently isolated two varieties of
the Bartonella bacteria as the cause of bacillary angiomatosis: Bartonella (formerly Rochalimaea quintana)
and B. henselae (cause of cat-scratch disease).
B. quintana infection is known popularly as trench
fever, and is the infection associated with body lice that
sickened European troops during World War I. Lice
carry the bacteria, and can transmit the infection to
humans. The incidence of trench fever was believed to
have faded away with the end of World War I. It was
not diagnosed in the United States until 1992, when 10
cases were reported among homeless Seattle men.
The related bacteria B. henselae was first identified several years ago as the cause of cat-scratch fever.
It also can lead to bacillary angiomatosis in AIDS
patients. Bacillary angiomatosis caused by this bacteria is transmitted to AIDS patients from cat fleas.
These two different types of bacteria both cause
bacillary angiomatosis, a disease which is characterized by wildly proliferating blood vessels that form
tumor-like masses in the skin and organs. The nodules
that appear in bacillary angiomatosis are firm and
don’t turn white when pressed. The lesions can occur
anywhere on the body, in numbers ranging from one
to 100. They are rarely found on palms of the hands,
soles of the feet, or in the mouth. As the number of
lesions increase, the patient may develop a high fever,
sweats, chills, poor appetite, vomiting, and weight loss.
If untreated, the infection may be fatal.
In addition to the basic disease process, the two
different types of bacteria cause some slightly different
symptoms. Patients infected with B. henselae also

Diagnosis
This life-threatening but curable infection is often
misdiagnosed, because it may be mistaken for other
conditions (such as Kaposi’s sarcoma). A blood test
developed in 1992 by the CDC detects antibodies to
the bacteria. It can be confirmed by reviewing symptoms, history and negative tests for other diseases that
cause swollen lymph glands. It isn’t necessary to
biopsy a small sample of the lymph node unless there
is a question of cancer of the lymph node or some
other disease.

Bacteremia

experience blood-filled cysts within the liver and
abnormal liver function, whereas B. quintana patients
may have tumor growths in the bone.

I Bacteremia
Definition
Bacteremia is an invasion of the bloodstream by
bacteria.

Description
Bacteremia occurs when bacteria enter the
bloodstream. This may occur through a wound or
infection, or through a surgical procedure or injection. Bacteremia may cause no symptoms and resolve
without treatment, or it may produce fever and other
symptoms of infection. In some cases, bacteremia
leads to septic shock, a potentially life-threatening
condition.

Treatment
Recent research indicates that antibiotics used to
treat other HIV opportunistic infections can both prevent and treat bacillary angiomatosis. Treatment is
usually given until the lesions disappear, which typically takes three or four weeks. A severely affected
lymph node or blister may have to be drained, and a
heating pad may help swollen, tender lymph glands.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may relieve pain, aches, and
fever over 101 8F (38.3 8C).

Prognosis
In most cases, prompt antibiotic treatment in
patients with AIDS cured the infection caused by
either variety of the bacteria, and patients may resume
normal life. Early diagnosis is crucial to a cure.

Prevention
Studies suggest that antibiotics may prevent
the disease. Patients also should be sure to treat cats
for fleas.

Causes and symptoms
Causes
Several types of bacteria live on the surface of the
skin or colonize the moist linings of the urinary tract,
lower digestive tract, and other internal surfaces. These
bacteria are normally harmless as long as they are kept
in check by the body’s natural barriers and the immune
system. People in good health with strong immune
systems rarely develop bacteremia. However, when
bacteria are introduced directly into the circulatory
system, especially in a person who is ill or undergoing
aggressive medical treatment, the immune system may
not be able to cope with the invasion, and symptoms of
bacteremia may develop. For this reason, bacteremia is
most common in people who are already affected by or
being treated for some other medical problem. In addition, medical treatment may bring a person in contact
with new types of bacteria that are more invasive than
those already residing in that person’s body, further
increasing the likelihood of bacterial infection.
Conditions which increase the chances of developing bacteremia include:

Bacteremia

KEY TERMS
Colostomy—Surgical creation of an artificial anus
on the abdominal wall by cutting into the colon and
bringing it up to the surface.
Gastrostomy—Surgical creation of an artificial
opening into the stomach through the abdominal
wall to allow tube feeding.
Jejunostomy—Surgical creation of an opening to
the middle portion of the small intestine (jejunum),
through the abdominal wall.
Septic shock—A life-threatening drop in blood
pressure caused by bacterial infection.

Not all of these symptoms are usually present. In
the elderly, confusion may be the only prominent symptom. Bacteremia may lead to septic shock, whose symptoms include decreased consciousness, rapid heart and
breathing rates and multiple organ failures.

Diagnosis
Bacteremia is diagnosed by culturing the blood
for bacteria. Samples may need to be tested several
times over several hours. Blood analysis may also
reveal an elevated number of white blood cells.
Blood pressure is monitored closely; a decline in
blood pressure may indicate the onset of septic shock.

Treatment
Common immediate causes of bacteremia include:


drainage of an abscess, including an abscessed tooth



urinary tract infection, especially in the presence of a
bladder catheter



decubitus ulcers (pressure sores)



intravenous procedures using unsterilized needles,
including IV drug use



prolonged IV needle placement



use of ostomy tubes, including gastrostomy (surgically
making a new opening into the stomach), jejunostomy
(surgically making an opening from the abdominal
wall into the jejunum), and colostomy (surgically
creating an articifical opening into the colon).

The bacteria most likely to cause bacteremia include
members of the Staphylococcus, Streptococcus,
Pseudomonas, Haemophilus, and Esherichia coli (E. coli)
genera.

Bacteremia may cause no symptoms, but may be
discovered through a blood test for another condition.
In this situation, it may not need to be treated, except
in patients especially at risk for infection, such as those
with heart valve defects or whose immune systems are
suppressed.

Prognosis
Prompt antibiotic therapy usually succeeds in clearing bacteria from the bloodstream. Recurrence may
indicate an undiscovered site of infection. Untreated
bacteria in the blood may spread, causing infection of
the heart (endocarditis or pericarditis) or infection of the
covering of the central nervous system (meningitis).

Prevention



fever over 101 8F (38.3 8C)



chills



malaise

Bacteremia can be prevented by preventing the
infections which often precede it. Good personal
hygiene, especially during viral illness, may reduce the
risk of developing bacterial infection. Treating bacterial
infections quickly and thoroughly can minimize the risk
of spreading infection. During medical procedures, the
burden falls on medical professionals to minimize the
number and duration of invasive procedures, to reduce
patients’ exposure to sources of bacteria when being
treated, and to use scrupulous technique.

Definition
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a type of vaginal infection in which the normal balance of bacteria in the
vagina is disrupted, allowing the overgrowth of harmful
anaerobic bacteria at the expense of protective bacteria.

Description
BV is the most, common and the most serious type
of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. As
many as 10 to 26 percent of pregnant women in the
United States have BV; BV has been found in 12 to 25
percent of women in routine clinic populations, and in 32
to 64 percent of women in clinics for sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs). BV is different than vaginal yeast infections and requires different methods of treatment.
In most cases, BV does not have lasting effects on
women. However, there can be risks associated with BV:

Causes and symptoms
Bacteria that dominate the vaginal flora in a BV
infection include Gardnerella vaginalis or Mobiluncus,
although other bacteria, such as Escherichia coli from
the rectum have also been shown to cause the disease.
The overgrowth of these harmful bacteria are at the
expense of the protective bacteria lactobacilli, which
secrete a natural disinfectant, hydrogen peroxide, that
maintains the healthy, normal balance of vaginal
microorganisms. The factors that upset the normal
balance of bacteria in the vagina are not well-understood; however, the following activities or behaviors
that have been associated with BV include:


having a new sex partner or multiple sex partners



stress



douching



using an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception

BV is not transmitted through toilet seats, bedding, swimming pools, or touching of objects. Women
who have not had sexual intercourse rarely have BV.
However BV is not considered an STD, although it
does appear to act like an STD in women who have sex
with women.
The main symptom of BV is a thin, watery or
foamy, white (milky) or gray vaginal discharge with
an unpleasant, foul, fish-like or musty odor. The odor
is sometimes stronger after a woman has sex, when the
semen mixes with the vaginal secretions. Burning or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS
Anaerobic bacteria—Bacteria that do not require
oxgyen, found in low concentrations in the normal
vagina
Vaginal discharge—discharge of secretions from the
cervical glands of the vagina; normally clear or white

pain during urination can also be present with BV.
Itching on the outside of the vagina and redness can
also occur, but are seen less frequently. However,
many women with BV do not exhibit any symptoms.

Diagnosis
BV is diagnosed through a examination of the
vagina by a health care provider. A woman who suspects that she may have BV should not douche or use a
feminine hygiene spray before the appointment with
the health care provider. Laboratory tests are conducted on a sample of the vaginal fluid to see if the
bacteria present are those associated with BV. The
health care provider may also check to see if there is
decreased vaginal acidity. Potassium hydroxide, when
added to a vaginal discharge sample, enhances vaginal
odors and allows the health care provider to determine
if the odor is fishy or foul.

Treatment
In a few cases, BV might clear up without treatment. However, all women with symptoms of BV
should be treated to relieve symptoms and to avoid
the development of complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). In most cases, male partners are
not treated, but female sexual partners should be examined to see if they have BV and require treatment.
BV is treated with prescription antibiotics such as
metronidazole or clindamycin creams or oral metronidazole (both are antibiotics that can also be used by pregnant women, although at different doses). Metronidazole
kills anaerobic bacteria but does not harm the protective
lactobacilli. Drinking alcohol should be avoided when
taking metronidazole, for this medicine can cause severe
nausea and vomiting when combined with alcohol.
For postmenopausal women, in addition to the
use of antibiotics, the health care provider may also
prescribe estrogen suppositories or topical cream to
thicken and lubricate vaginal tissues. Sexual activity
should be avoided during treatment; a condom should
be used if the woman does have sexual intercourse.

Bacterial vaginosis

The woman should be tested after treatment to ensure
that the infection has been cured.

Alternative treatment

Prevention
Since the development of BV often appears to be
associated with sexual activities, recommended ways
to avoid BV include:

Supplement therapies are available in addition to
the use of prescription medicines to ease recovery.
Herbal therapies
Fresh garlic (Allium sativum) has antibacterial
properties and can be added to a woman’s diet. A
fresh, peeled garlic wrapped in gauze can also be
inserted into the vagina to help treat BV. The insert
should be changed twice daily.
To soothe itching or irritation of the vaginal tissues, a woman can bathe the tissues in an infusion of
fresh chickweed (Stellaria media). The infusion is
made by pouring one cup of boiling water on one to
two teaspoons of the herb, steeping for five minutes,
and allowing the mixture to cool before use.

Other ways to prevent BV include:


discontinuing the use of tampons for six months



practicing good hygiene by wiping from front to
back (away from the vagina) after bowel movements
to avoid spreading bacteria from the rectum to the
vagina



wearing cotton panties and panty-hose with a cotton
crotch and avoiding tight or latex clothing to keep
the vagina cool and dry



avoiding the use of perfumed soaps and feminine
sprays



lowering stress levels



avoiding douching, as douching removes some of the
normal bacteria in the vagina that protects women
from infection



finishing the course of antibiotic treatment, even if
the symptoms are relieved, to prevent reoccurrence
of the disease



routinely being tested for BV during regular gynecological examinations

Prognosis


Pregnant women with BV often have babies of low birth
weight (less than 5.5 pounds) or who are premature



Bacteria that cause BV may also cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), an infection of the uterus and
fallopian tubes. The risk of a woman with BV developing PID is higher after the woman undergoes surgical procedures such as a hysterectomy or an
abortion. PID can result in infertility and can also
increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy



BV may increase the risk of a woman becoming
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS



A woman with BV and HIV is more likely to pass
HIV to her sexual partner



BV increases the chance that a woman will contract
other STDs, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea

Some physicians recommend that all women who
have a hysterectomy or an abortion be treated for BV,
to reduce the risk of developing PID.

I Bad breath
Definition
Bad breath, sometimes called halitosis, is an
unpleasant odor of the breath.

Description
Bad breath is likely to be experienced by most
adults at least occasionally. Bad breath, either real or
imagined, can have a significant impact on a person’s
social and professional life.

Causes and symptoms
Bad breath can be caused by a number of problems. Oral diseases, fermentation of food particles in
the mouth, sinus infections, and unclean dentures can
all contribute to mouth odor. Many non-oral diseases,
such as lung infections, kidney failure, or severe liver
disease, can also cause bad breath, though rarely.
Many people think that bad breath can originate in
the stomach or intestines; this is extremely rare. The
esophagus is usually collapsed and closed, and,
although a belch may carry odor up from the stomach,
the chance of bad breath being caused from air continually escaping from the stomach is remote.
Cigarette smoke can cause bad breath, not only in
the cigarette smoker, but also in one who is constantly
exposed to second-hand smoke.

Diagnosis
The easiest way to determine if one has bad breath
is to ask someone who is trustworthy and discrete.

KEY TERMS
Halitosis— The medical term for bad breath.

This is usually not too difficult. Another, more private, method of determining if one has bad breath is to
lick one’s wrist, wait until it dries, then smell the area.
Scraping the rear area of the tongue with a plastic
spoon, then smelling the spoon, is another method
one can use to assess bad breath.

Treatment
The most effective treatment of bad breath is to
treat the cause. Poor oral hygiene can be improved by
regular brushing and flossing, as well as regular dental
checkups. Gentle brushing of the tongue should be
part of daily oral hygiene. In addition to good oral
hygiene, the judicious use of mouthwashes is helpful.
Mouth dryness, experienced at night or during fasting,
or due to certain medications and medical conditions,
can contribute to bad breath. Dryness can be avoided
by drinking adequate amounts of water. Chewing gum
may be beneficial.
As mentioned, some medications, such as some
high blood pressure medications, can cause dry mouth.
If this problem is significant, a medication change, under
the supervision of one’s health care provider, may
improve the dry-mouth condition. Oral or sinus infections, once diagnosed, can be treated medically, usually
with antibiotics. Lung infections and kidney or liver
problems will, of course, need medical treatment.

Alternative treatment
Depending on the cause, a multitude of alternative therapeutic remedies can be used. For example,
sinusitis can be treated with steam inhalation of essential oils and/or herbs.

Prognosis
Most bad breath can be treated successfully with
good oral hygiene and/or medical care. Occasionally,
for patients who feel that these therapies are unsuccessful,
some delusional or obsessive behavior pattern might pertain, and mental health counseling may be appropriate.

I Balance and coordination tests
Definition
Balance is the ability to maintain a position.
Coordination is the capacity to move through a complex
set of movements. Balance and coordination depend on
the interaction of multiple body organs and systems
including the eyes, ears, brain and nervous system, cardiovascular system, and muscles. Tests or examination
of any or all of these organs or systems may be necessary
to determine the causes of loss of balance, dizziness, or
the inability to coordinate movement or activities.

Purpose
Tests of balance and coordination, and the examination of the organs and systems that influence
balance and coordination, can help to identify causes
of dizziness, fainting, falling, or incoordination.

Precautions
Tests for balance and coordination should be conducted in a safe and controlled area where patients will
not experience injury if they become dizzy or fall.

Description
Assessment of balance and coordination can
include discussion of the patient’s medical history and
a complete physical examination including evaluation of
the heart, head, eyes, and ears. A slow pulse or heart
rate, or very low blood pressure may indicate a circulatory system problem, which can cause dizziness or fainting. During the examination, the patient may be asked
to rotate the head from side to side while sitting up or
while lying down with the head and neck extended over
the edge of the examination table. If these tests produce
dizziness or a rapid twitching of the eyeballs (nystagmus), the patient may have a disorder of the inner ear,
which is responsible for maintaining balance.
An examination of the eyes and ears may also give
clues to episodes of dizziness or incoordination. The
patient may be asked to focus on a light or on a distant
point or object, and to look up, down, left, and right

belt so that the physical therapist can catch him if he loses

permission.)

moving only the eyes while the eyes are examined.
Problems with vision may, in themselves, contribute
to balance and coordination disturbances, or may
indicate more serious problems of the nervous system
or brain function. Hearing loss, fluid in the inner ear,
or ear infection might indicate the cause of balance
and coordination problems.
Various physical tests may also be used. A patient
may be asked to walk a straight line, stand on one foot,
or touch a finger to the nose to help assess balance.
The patient may be asked to squeeze or push against
the doctor’s hands, to squat down, to bend over, stand
on tiptoes or stand on their heels. Important aspects of
these tests include holding positions for a certain number of seconds, successfully repeating movements a
certain number of times, and repeating the test accurately with eyes closed. The patient’s reflexes may also
be tested. For example, the doctor may tap on the

knees, ankles, and elbows with a small rubber mallet to
test nervous system functioning. These tests may
reveal muscle weakness or nervous system problems
that could contribute to incoordination.

Preparation
No special preparation is required prior to administration of balance and coordination tests. The
patient may be asked to disrobe and put on an examination gown to make it easier for the doctor to
observe muscles and reflex responses.

Aftercare
No special aftercare is generally required, however,
some of the tests may cause episodes of dizziness or
incoordination. Patients may need to use caution in
returning to normal activities if they are experiencing
any symptoms of dizziness, lightheadedness, or weakness.

Risks
These simple tests of balance and coordination are
generally harmless.

Normal results
Under normal conditions, these test will not cause
dizziness, loss of balance, or incoordination.

Abnormal results
The presence of dizziness, lightheadedness, loss of
coordination, unusual eye movements, muscle weakness, or impaired reflexes are abnormal results and
may indicate the problem causing the loss of balance
or incoordination. In some cases, additional testing
may be needed to diagnose the cause of balance or
coordination problems.

I Balanitis
Definition
Balanitis is an inflammation of the head and foreskin of the penis.

Description
Balanitis generally affects uncircumcised males.
These are men who have a foreskin, which is the
‘‘hood’’ of soft skin that partially covers the head of
the penis. In balanitis, the head and foreskin become
red and inflamed. (In circumcised men, who lack a
foreskin, these symptoms only affect the tip of the
penis.) The condition often occurs due to the fungus
Candida albicans, the same organism that causes vaginal yeast infections in women. Balanitis (which is also
referred to as balanoposthitis) can be caused by a
variety of other fungal or bacterial infections, or may
occur due to a sensitivity reaction to common chemical agents.
Uncircumcised men are more at risk for balanitis
due to the presence of the foreskin. The snug fit of the
foreskin around the top of the penis tends to create a
damp, warm environment that encourages the growth
of microorganisms. Most of the organisms associated
with balanitis are already present on the penis, but in
very small numbers. However, if the area between the
head and foreskin is not cleansed thoroughly on a
regular basis, these organisms can multiply and lead
to infection.
Diabetes can increase the risk of developing the
condition.

Causes and symptoms
Balanitis is usually a result of poor hygiene—for
example, neglecting to bathe for several days. A failure
to properly wash (or rinse) the area between the head and
foreskin can lead to the development of fungal or bacterial infections that cause the condition. In other cases,
balanitis may occur due to an allergic reaction: Some

preventing yeast infections–a common cause of balanitis. These remedies include garlic, calendula, and
goldenseal. Eating yogurt that contains acidophilus
may also help to clear up a Candida infection.

Prognosis
Most cases go away quickly once the cause is
identified and treated. However, regular bouts of balanitis can result in urethral stricture.

Prevention
men may be sensitive to chemicals found in harsh soaps,
laundry detergents, or contraceptive creams. Men who
contract a sexually transmitted disease (STD) such as
trichimoniasis may also develop symptoms.
The symptoms of balanitis are limited to the foreskin and head of the penis (in circumcised men, only
the head is affected). These include redness, inflammation, pain, discharge, sore or itchy skin, and difficulty
retracting the foreskin.

Diagnosis
Balanitis is usually diagnosed based on a brief
physical examination. This may be conducted by
your regular health care provider or by a urologist,
the type of doctor who specializes in such disorders.
The doctor may take a sample of the discharge (if any)
to determine the nature of the possible infection. A
urine test may be recommended to evaluate glucose
(sugar) levels in the urine. Balanitis treatment is typically covered by medical insurance.

Treatment
The treatment of balanitis depends on the specific
cause, which can vary from case to case. Antibiotics are
used to treat bacterial infections, while topical antifungals such as clotrimazole can combat balanitis caused by
Candida. If an allergic reaction is causing symptoms, the
goal is to identify the chemical agent responsible.
Ointments or creams may be used to ease skin irritation.
No matter what the cause, it is important to thoroughly clean the penis on a daily basis in order to
alleviate symptoms. If the condition keeps occurring,
or if the inflammation is interfering with urination,
circumcision may be advised.

Alternative treatment
According to practitioners of alternative medicine, certain herbs may be effective in controlling or

I Balantidiasis
Definition
Balantidiasis is an infectious disease produced by
a single-celled microorganism (protozoan) called
Balantidium coli that infects the digestive tract. It is
primarily a disease of the tropics, although it is also
found in cooler, temperate climates. Most persons
with balantidiasis do not exhibit any noticeable symptoms (asymptomatic), but a few individuals will
develop diarrhea with blood and mucus and an
inflamed colon (colitis).

Description
Balantidiasis is caused by Balantidium coli, a parasitic protozoan that infects the large intestine. B. coli is
the largest and only protozoan, having cilia or hairlike structures, that is capable of causing disease in
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Asymptomatic—Persons who carry a disease and
are usually capable of transmitting the disease but
who do not exhibit symptoms of the disease are
said to be asymptomatic.
Biopsy—The removal of a tissue sample for diagnostic purposes.
Ciliated—Covered with short, hair-like protrusions, like B. coli and certain other protozoa. The
cilia or hairs help the organism to move.
Colitis—An inflammation of the large intestine that
occurs in some cases of balantidiasis. It is marked
by cramping pain and the passing of bloody mucus.
Protozoan—A single-celled, usually microscopic
organism, such as B. coli, that is eukaryotic and,
therefore, different from bacteria (prokaryotic).
Sigmoidoscopy—A procedure in which a thin, flexible, lighted instrument, called a sigmoidoscope, is
used to visually examine the lower part of the large
intestine.

humans. Balantidiasis occurs most commonly in areas
with poor sanitation and in settings where humans live
in close contact with pigs, sheep, or goats.

Most individuals with balantidiasis have no
noticeable symptoms. Even though these individuals
may not feel ill, they are still capable of infecting
others by person-to-person contact or by contaminating food or water with cysts that others may ingest, for
example, by preparing food with unwashed hands.
The most common symptoms of balantidiasis are
chronic diarrhea or severe colitis with abdominal
cramps, pain, and bloody stools. Complications may
include intestinal perforation in which the intestinal
wall becomes torn, but the organisms do not spread to
other parts of the body in the blood stream.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of balantidiasis, as with other similar
diseases, can be complicated, partly because symptoms may or may not be present. A diagnosis of
balantidiasis may be considered when a patient has
diarrhea combined with a possible history of recent
exposure to amebiasis through travel, contact with
infected persons, or anal intercourse.
Specifically, a diagnosis of balantidiasis is made
by finding B. coli cysts or trophozoites in the patient’s
stools or by finding trophozoites in tissue samples
(biopsy) taken from the large bowel. A diagnostic
blood test has not yet been developed.
Stool examination

Causes and symptoms
Balantidiasis is transmitted primarily by eating food
or drinking water that has been contaminated by human
or animal feces containing B. coli cysts. During its life
cycle, this organism exists in two very different forms: the
infective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot move but
can survive outside the human body because of its thick,
protective covering; and the disease-producing form, the
trophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannot
survive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannot
infect others. In the digestive tract, the cysts are transported to the intestine where the walls of the cysts are
broken open by digestive secretions, releasing the mobile
trophozoites. Once released within the intestine, the trophozoites multiply by feeding on intestinal bacteria or by
invading the lining of the large intestine. Within the lining
of the large intestine, the trophozoites secrete a substance
that destroys intestinal tissue and creates sores (ulcers) or
abscesses. Trophozoites eventually form new cysts that
are carried through the digestive tract and excreted in the
feces. Under favorable temperature and humidity conditions, the cysts can survive in soil or water for weeks to
months, ready to begin the cycle again.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

This test involves microscopically examining a
stool sample for the presence of cysts and/or trophozoites of B. coli.
Sigmoidoscopy
To take a tissue sample from the large intestine, a
procedure called a sigmoidoscopy is performed.
During a sigmoidoscopy, a thin, flexible instrument
is used to visually examine the intestinal lining and
obtain small tissue specimens.

Treatment
Patients with balantidiasis are treated with prescription medication, typically consisting of a ten day
course of either tetracycline or metronidazole.
Alternative drugs that have proven effective in treating balantidiasis include iodoquinol or paromomycin.

Prognosis
Although somewhat dependent on the patient’s
overall health, in general, the prognosis for most

patients with balantidiasis is good. Severely infected
patients occasionally die as a result of a tear in the
intestinal wall (intestinal perforation) and consequent
loss of blood.

Prevention
There are no immunization procedures or medications that can be taken prior to potential exposure to
prevent balantidiasis. Moreover, people who have had
the disease can become reinfected. Prevention requires
effective personal and community hygiene. Specific
safeguards include the following:


Purification of drinking water. Water can be purified
by filtering, boiling, or treatment with iodine.



Proper food handling. Measures include protecting

I Balloon valvuloplasty
Definition
Balloon valvuloplasty is a procedure in which a
narrowed heart valve is stretched open using a procedure that does not require open heart surgery.
490

KEY TERMS
Cardiac catheterization—A technique used to
evaluate the heart and fix certain problems.
Catheterization is far less invasive than traditional
surgery.
Stenosis—The narrowing of any valve, especially
one of the heart valves or the opening into the
pulmonary artery from the right ventricle.
Valve—Tissue in the passageways between the
heart’s upper and lower chambers that controls
passage of blood and prevents regurgitation.

Purpose
There are four valves in the heart, which are
located at the exit of each of the four chambers of
the heart. They are called aortic valve, pulmonary
valve, mitral valve, and tricuspid valve. The valves
open and close to regulate the blood flow from one
chamber to the next. They are vital to the efficient
functioning of the heart.
In some people the valves are too narrow (a condition called stenosis). Balloon valvuloplasty is performed on children and adults to improve valve
function and blood flow by enlarging the valve opening. It is a treatment for aortic, mitral, and pulmonary
stenosis. Balloon valvuloplasty has the best results as a
treatment for narrowed pulmonary valves. Results in
treating narrowing of the mitral valve are generally
good. It is more difficult to perform and less successful
in treating narrowing of the aortic valve.

Description
Balloon valvuloplasty is a procedure in which a
thin tube (catheter) that has a small deflated balloon at
the tip is inserted through the skin in the groin area
into a blood vessel, and then is threaded up to the
opening of the narrowed heart valve. The balloon is
inflated, which stretches the valve open. This procedure cures many valve obstructions. It is also called
balloon enlargement of a narrowed heart valve.
The procedure is performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory and takes up to four hours. The patient is
usually awake, but is given local anesthesia to make the
area where the catheter is inserted numb. After the site
where the catheter will be inserted is prepared and
anesthetized, the cardiologist inserts a catheter into the
appropriate blood vessel, then passes a balloon-tipped

Preparation
For at least six hours before balloon valvuloplasty, the patient will have to avoid eating or drinking
anything. An intravenous line is inserted so that medications can be administered. The patient’s groin area
is shaved and cleaned with an antiseptic. About an
hour before the procedure, the patient is given an
oral sedative such as diazepam (Valium).

Aftercare
After balloon valvuloplasty, the patient is sent to
the recovery room for several hours, where he or she is
monitored for vital signs (such as pulse and breathing)
and heart sounds. An electrocardiogram, which is a
record of the electrical impulses in the heart, is done.
The leg in which the catheter was inserted is temporarily prevented from moving. The skin condition is
monitored. The insertion site, which will be covered
by a sandbag, is observed for bleeding until the catheter is removed. Intravenous fluids will be given to help
eliminate the x-ray dye; intravenous blood thinners or
other medications to dilate the coronary arteries may
be given. Pain medication is available.
For at least 30 minutes after removal of the catheter, direct pressure is applied to the site of insertion; after
this a pressure dressing will be applied. Following discharge from the hospital, the patient can usually resume
normal activities. After balloon valvuloplasty lifelong
follow-up is necessary because valves sometimes degenerate or narrowing recurs, making surgery necessary.

Risks
Balloon valvuloplasty can have serious complications. For example, the valve can become misshapen so
that it doesn’t close completely, which makes the condition worse. Embolism, where pieces of the valve break off
and travel to the brain or the lungs, is another possible
risk. If the procedure causes severe damage to the valve
leaflets, immediate surgery is required. Less frequent
complications are bleeding and hematoma (a local collection of clotted blood) at the puncture site, abnormal

I Barbiturate-induced coma
Definition
A barbiturate-induced coma, or barb coma, is a
temporary state of unconsciousness brought on by a
controlled dose of a barbiturate drug, usually pentobarbital or thiopental.

Purpose
Barbiturate comas are used to protect the brain
during major brain surgery, such as the removal of
arteriovenous malformations or aneurysms. Coma may
also be induced to control intracranial hypertension
caused by brain injury.

Precautions
Barbiturate-induced comas are used when conventional therapy to reduce intracranial hypertension
has failed. Barbiturate dosing is geared toward burst
suppression–that is, reducing brain activity as measured by electroencephalography. This reduction in
brain activity has to be balanced against the potential
side effects of barbiturates, which include allergic reactions and effects on the cardiovascular system.

Description
One of the greatest hazards associated with brain
injury is intracranial hypertension. Brain injury may be
caused by an accidental head injury or a medical condition, such as stroke, tumor, or infection. When the
brain is injured, fluids accumulate in the brain, causing
it to swell. The skull does not allow for the expansion of
the brain; in effect, the brain becomes compressed.

Barbiturate-induced coma

catheter through the first catheter. Guided by a video
monitor and an x ray, the physician slowly threads the
catheter into the heart. The deflated balloon is positioned in the valve opening, then is inflated repeatedly.
The inflated balloon widens the valve’s opening by splitting the valve leaflets apart. Once the valve is widened,
the balloon-tipped catheter is removed. The other catheter remains in place for 6 to 12 hours because in some
cases the procedure must be repeated.

Barbiturates

KEY TERMS
Aneurysm—A bulge or sack-like projection from a
blood vessel.
Arteriovenous malformation—An abnormal tangle
of arteries and veins in which the arteries feed
directly into the veins without a normal intervening
capillary bed.
Diuretic agent—A drug which increases urine
output.
Electroencephalography—The recording of electrical potentials produced by the brain. These
potentials indicate brain activity.
Hyperventilation—A respiratory therapy involving
deeper and/or faster breathing to keep the carbon
dioxide pressure in the blood below normal.
Intracranial hypertension—Abnormally high
blood pressure within the skull.
Osmotherapy—Intravenous injection or oral
administration of an agent that induces dehydration. The goal of dehydration is to reduce the
amount of accumulated fluid in the brain.
Steroid—A type of drug used to reduce swelling.

If the pressure does not abate, oxygenated blood
may not reach all areas of the brain. Also, the brain
tissue may be forced against hard, bony edges on the
interior of the skull. In either case, the brain tissue may
die, causing permanent brain damage or death.

failed. Before coma is induced, intracranial hypertension may be treated by hyperventilation; by
facilitation of blood flow from the brain; by
decompressive surgical procedures, such as draining
excess fluids from under the skull or from the
chambers within the brain (ventricles); or by drug
therapy, including osmotherapy, diuretic agents, or
steroids.

Risks
An estimated 25% of barbiturate-induced
comas are accompanied by severe side effects. The
side effects of barbiturates, especially the depressive effect on the cardiovascular system, can be too
risky for some patients. Other side effects include
impaired gastrointestinal motility and impaired
immune response and infection. Since barbiturates
depress activity in the brain, measurements of
brain activity may be unreliable. Careful monitoring of the patient is required to ensure nutritional
needs are being met and to guard against complications, such as lung infection, fevers, or deep vein
blood clots.

Normal results
In many patients who do not respond to conventional therapy, barbiturate-induced coma can
achieve the necessary control of intracranial
hypertension.
Resources
PERIODICALS

Barbiturates reduce the metabolic rate of brain
tissue, as well as the cerebral blood flow. With these
reductions, the blood vessels in the brain narrow,
decreasing the amount of swelling in the brain. With
the swelling relieved, the pressure decreases and some
or all brain damage may be averted.

Hemispheric Stroke: Useful or Obsolete?’’ Neurology 48
(1997): 1608.

Controversy exists, however, over the benefits of
using barbiturates to control intracranial hypertension. Some studies have shown that barbiturateinduced coma can reduce intracranial hypertension
but does not necessarily prevent brain damage.
Furthermore, the reduction in intracranial hypertension may not be sustained.

I Barbiturates
Definition
Barbiturates are medicines that act on the central
nervous system and cause drowsiness and can control
seizures.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Barbiturates are in the group of medicines known
as central nervous system depressants (CNS). Also
known as sedative-hypnotic drugs, barbiturates make
people very relaxed, calm, and sleepy. These drugs are
sometimes used to help patients relax before surgery.
Some may also be used to control seizures (convulsions). Although barbiturates have been used to treat
nervousness and sleep problems, they have generally
been replaced by other medicines for these purposes.
These medicines may become habit forming and
should not be used to relieve everyday anxiety and
tension or to treat sleeplessness over long periods.

Description
Barbiturates are available only with a physician’s
prescription and are sold in capsule, tablet, liquid,
and injectable forms. Some commonly used barbiturates are phenobarbital (Barbita) and secobarbital
(Seconal).

Recommended dosage
Recommended dosage depends on the type of
barbiturate and other factors such as the patient’s
age and the condition for which the medicine is being
taken. Check with the physician who prescribed the
drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for
the correct dosage.
Always take barbiturates exactly as directed.
Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do
not take the drug for longer than directed. If the
medicine does not seem to be working, even after
taking it for several weeks, do not increase the
dosage. Instead, check with the physician who prescribed the medicine.
Do not stop taking this medicine suddenly without first checking with the physician who prescribed it.
It may be necessary to taper down gradually to reduce
the chance of withdrawal symptoms. If it is necessary
to stop taking the drug, check with the physician for
instructions on how to stop.

Precautions
See a physician regularly while taking barbiturates. The physician will check to make sure the medicine is working as it should and will note unwanted
side effects.
Because barbiturates work on the central nervous
system, they may add to the effects of alcohol and

blood that carries oxygen from the lungs throughout the body and brings waste carbon dioxide from
the cells to the lungs, where it is released.
Central nervous system—The brain and spinal
cord.
Hallucination—A false or distorted perception of
objects, sounds, or events that seems real.
Hallucinations usually result from drugs or mental

such as antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine, sleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers,
some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants. They may
also add to the effects of anesthetics, including those
used for dental procedures. The combined effects of
barbiturates and alcohol or other CNS depressants
(drugs that slow the central nervous system) can be
very dangerous, leading to unconsciousness or even
death. Anyone taking barbiturates should not drink
alcohol and should check with his or her physician
before taking any medicines classified as CNS
depressants.
Taking an overdose of barbiturates or combining
barbiturates with alcohol or other central nervous
system depressants can cause unconsciousness and
even death. Anyone who shows signs of an overdose

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Bariatric surgery promotes weight loss by changing the digestive system’s anatomy, limiting the
amount of food that can be eaten and digested.

Purpose
Obesity normally is defined through the use of
body mass index (BMI) measurement. Physician
offices, obesity associations, nutritionists, and others
offer methods for calculating BMI, which is a comparison of height to weight. Those with a BMI of 30 or
higher are considered obese. However, at 40 or higher,
they are considered severely obese—approximately
about 100 pounds overweight for men and 80 pounds
overweight for women.
Many people who are obese struggle to lose
weight through diet and exercise but fail. Only after
they have tried other methods of losing weight will
they be candidates for bariatric surgery, which today
is considered a ‘‘last resort’’ for weight loss. In general,
guidelines agree that those with a BMI of 40 or more,

than 23 million Americans are candidates for bariatric
surgery. More than 100,000 of the procedures were
performed in 2003 and the number of surgeries performed will probably continue to rise for many years.

Precautions
Bariatric surgery is not for everyone and the
surgeon and other physicians will evaluate all medical conditions before allowing a patient to proceed. As a major surgery, there are associated
risks and side effects. Women of childbearing age
should be aware that rapid weight loss and nutritional deficiency associated with bariatric surgery
may be harmful to a developing fetus. It is important that a patient reveal all current medications
and conditions during any pre-operative discussions or examinations. Also, the physician will
carefully evaluate the patient to ensure that he or
she is prepared to make a lifelong commitment to
the changes in eating and lifestyle required to make
the surgery successful.
Though many studies have shown general safety
associated with the major surgeries, they are relatively
new and research on long-term effects are not as widespread as they are for many other surgeries and procedures. When choosing a surgeon to perform the
operation, patients should check with organizations
such as the American Society for Bariatric Surgery
for certification. A patient also should ask about the
surgeon’s experience in performing the particular
operation.
Although the number of obese teenagers and
resulting bariatric surgeries has increased, some
experts are questioning the decision to perform
bariatric surgery on teens. There are no specific clinical guidelines for determining a safe age for the
procedure, but some physicians agree that bariatric
surgery is not appropriate for children younger than
496

age 15, since they are still growing and forming
bones.

Description
When food is chewed and swallowed, it moves
along the digestive tract. In the stomach, a strong
acid helps break down food so it can be digested
and the body can absorb the food’s nutrients and
calories. The stomach can hold about three pints
of food at one time. As digestion continues, food
particles become smaller and move from the stomach
into the intestine. The various parts of the small
intestine are nearly 20 feet long if laid out straight.
Those food particles not digested in the small intestine are stored in the large intestine until they are
eliminated as waste.
When a patient has bariatric surgery, this digestive process is altered to help the patient lose weight.
There are three main types of bariatric surgery, but
only two types are commonly used today. The types
are restrictive, malabsorptive, and combined restrictive/malabsorptive.
Restrictive surgery, often referred to as ‘‘stomach stapling’’ uses bands or staples to create a
small pouch at the top of the stomach where food
enters from the esophagus. This smaller pouch may
hold only about 1 ounce of food at first and may
stretch to hold about 2-3 ounces. The pouch’s
lower opening is made small, so that food moves
slowly to the lower part of the stomach, adding to
the feeling of fullness. The most frequently performed types of restrictive surgeries are vertical
banded gastroplasty (VBG), gastric banding, and
laparoscopic gastric banding. VBG is used less
today in favor of gastric banding, which involves
an adjustable hollow band made of silicone rubber.
Laparoscopic gastric banding, or Lap-band, was
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in 2001. Sometimes referred to as ‘‘minimally
invasive’’ bariatric surgery, the surgeon uses small
incisions and a laparoscope, or a small, tubular instrument with a camera attached, to see inside the abdomen and apply the band.
Malabsorptive procedures help patients lose
weight by limiting the amount of nutrients and calories the intestine can absorb. Sometimes called intestinal bypasses, they are no longer used in the United
States because they have often resulted in severe nutritional deficiencies.
Combined restrictive/malabsorptive operations
are the most common bariatric surgeries. They work
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

is important for bariatric surgery patients to lose
weight at the recommended pace, take nutritional supplements as recommended, and attend follow-up visits
with physicians and nutritionists.

Procedure times vary, depending on the type of
bariatric surgery chosen. However, most patients are
in surgery for about one to two hours. Though costs
can be as high as $35,000, more insurance companies
are beginning to pay for the procedures if they are
proven medically necessary. In 2004, the agency that
pays for Medicare costs recognized obesity and many
of its treatments as a medical cost for the first time,
recognizing that obesity leads to many other medical
problems.

The surgeon performing the procedure should
discuss its specific risks prior to surgery. Risks for
bariatric surgery include infection, blood clots, abdominal hernia, gallstones, nutritional deficiencies, possible nerve complications, and death. Death rates have
been reported lowest for RGB and VBG, at less than
1% of patients.

Preparation
The physician will first make sure that a patient is
mentally prepared for the surgery and the commitment to follow-up care that will be required. Patients
should have a consultation appointment with the
surgeon prior to the procedure to discuss risks and
benefits. Pre-operative instructions will be given that
will tell the patient specific preparations prior to the
surgery. These may include instructions about avoiding food or liquids, certain medications, and other
instructions on the day before or the day of the procedure. Patients also may have several laboratory or
other diagnostic tests prior to the surgery.

Aftercare
Depending on the type of procedure and any possible complications, patients can expect to stay at the
hospital or surgery center for about two to four days
following the surgery. Those who have laparoscopic
operations typically have shorter hospital stays and
speedier recovery times. The physician and nurses will
provide instructions for wound care and other followup when the patient is discharged from the hospital.
Usually, bariatric surgery patients can resume normal
activity within about six weeks following surgery, and
as little as two weeks after laparoscopic procedures. It
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

How a patient complies with instructions from
physicians following bariatric surgery is important.
Most patients will require lifelong use of nutritional
supplements such as multivitamins, calcium, and other
vitamin supplements to prevent nutritional deficiencies. Because the stomach is smaller, patients will have
to eat small portions of food and often must avoid
certain types of food such as sugar.

Risks

Normal results
Weight loss will occur gradually, as patients can
eat less food and absorb fewer calories. When patients
follow post-operative instructions, they can lead normal lives, eating less food and being careful to limit
certain foods that may irritate their new stomach
pouches. Most patients will lose 50–60% of their
excess weight in the first year or two. With gastric
bypass surgery, many can lose up to two-thirds of
excess weight by the second postoperative year.

by restricting both the amount of food the stomach
can hold and the amount of calories and nutrients the
body absorbs. The most common and successful combined surgery in recent years is called the Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass (RGB). In this operation, the surgeon
first creates a small pouch at the top of the stomach.
Next, a Y-shaped section of the small intestine is connected to the small pouch, allowing food to bypass the
lower stomach, the first part of the small intestine
(duodenum), and the first portion of the next section
of the small intestine ( jejunum). It connects into the
second half of the jejunum, reducing the amount of
calories and nutrients the body absorbs. RGB may be
performed with a laparoscope and a series of tiny
incisions or with a large abdominal incision.

I Barium enema
Definition
A barium enema, also known as a lower GI (gastrointestinal) exam, is a test that uses x-ray examination to view the large intestine. There are two types of
this test: the single-contrast technique where barium
sulfate is injected into the rectum in order to gain a
profile view of the large intestine; and the doublecontrast (or ‘‘air contrast’’) technique where air is
inserted into the rectum.

KEY TERMS
Barium sulfate—A barium compound used during
a barium enema to block the passage of x rays
during the exam.
Bowel lumen—The space within the intestine.
Colonoscopy—An examination of the upper portion of the rectum performed with a colonoscope or
elongated speculum.
Diverticula—A diverticulum of the colon is a sac or
pouch in the colon walls which is usually asymptomatic (without symptoms) but may cause difficulty
if it becomes inflamed.
Diverticulitis—A condition of the diverticulum of
the intestinal tract, especially in the colon, where
inflammation may cause distended sacs extending
from the colon and pain.
Ulcerative colitis— An ulceration or erosion of the
mucosa of the colon.
Proctosigmoidoscopy—A visual examination of the
rectum and sigmoid colon using a sigmoidoscope.

Purpose
A barium enema may be performed for a variety of
reasons, including to aid in the diagnosis of colon and
rectal cancer (or colorectal cancer), and inflammatory
disease. Detection of polyps (a benign growth in the
tissue lining of the colon and rectum), diverticula (a
pouch pushing out from the colon), and structural
changes in the large intestine can also be established with
this test. The double-contrast barium enema is the best
method for detecting small tumors (such as polyps), early
inflammatory disease, and bleeding caused by ulcers.
The decision to perform a barium enema is based
on a person’s history of altered bowel habits. These
can include diarrhea, constipation, any lower abdominal pain they are currently exhibiting, blood, mucus,
or pus in their stools. It is also recommended that this
exam be used every five to 10 years to screen healthy
people for colorectal cancer, the second most deadly
type of tumor in the United States. Those who have
a close relative with colorectal cancer or have had
a precancerous polyp are considered to be at an
increased risk for the disease and should be screened
more frequently to look for abnormalities.

Precautions
While barium enema is an effective screening
method in the detection of symptoms and may lead
to a timely diagnosis of several diseases, it is not the
498

only method to do this. As of 1997, some studies have
shown that the colonoscopy procedure performed by
experienced gastroenterologists is a more accurate
initial diagnostic tool for detecting early signs of colorectal cancer. A colonoscopy is the most accurate way
for the physician to examine the entire colon and
rectum for polyps. If abnormalities are seen at this
time the procedure is accompanied by a biopsy.
Some physicians use sigmoidoscopy plus a barium
enema instead of colonoscopy.

Description
To begin a barium enema, the patient will lie with
their back down on a tilting radiographic table in order
to have x rays of the abdomen taken. After being
assisted to a different position, a well-lubricated rectal
tube is inserted through the anus. This tube allows the
physician or assistant to slowly administer the barium
into the intestine. While this filling process is closely
monitored, it is important for the patient to keep the
anus tightly contracted against the rectal tube to help
maintain its position and prevent the barium from
leaking. This step is emphasized to the patient due to
the inaccuracy that may be caused if the barium leaks.
A rectal balloon may also be inflated to help retain the
barium. The table may be tilted or the patient moved to
a different position to aid in the filling process.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Preparation
In order to conduct the most accurate barium
enema test, the patient must follow a prescribed diet
and bowel preparation instructions prior to the test.
This preparation commonly includes restricted intake
of diary products and a liquid diet for 24 hours prior to
the test, in addition to drinking large amounts of water
or clear liquids 12–24 hours before the test. Patients
may also be given laxatives, and asked to give themselves a cleansing enema.
In addition to the prescribed diet and bowel preparation prior to the test, the patient can expect the
following during a barium enema:


They will be well draped with a gown as they are
secured to a tilting x-ray table.



As the barium or air is injected into the intestine, they
may experience cramping pains or the urge to defecate.



The patient will be instructed to take slow, deep
breaths through the mouth to ease any discomfort.

Aftercare
Patients should follow several steps immediately
after undergoing a barium enema, including:


Drink plenty of fluids to help counteract the dehydrating effects of bowel preparation and the test.



Take time to rest. A barium enema and the bowel
preparation taken before it can be exhausting.



A cleansing enema may be given to eliminate any
remaining barium. Lightly colored stools will be prevalent for the next 24–72 hours following the test.

Risks
While a barium enema is considered a safe screening
test used on a routine basis, it can cause complications in
certain people. The following indications should be kept
in mind before a barium enema is performed:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



Those who have a rapid heart rate, severe ulcerative
colitis, toxic megacolon, or a presumed perforation
in the intestine should not undergo a barium enema.



The test can be cautiously performed if the patient
has a blocked intestine, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, or severe bloody diarrhea.



Complications that may be caused by the test include
perforation of the colon, water intoxication, barium
granulomas (inflamed nodules), and allergic reaction. These are all very rare.

Normal results
When the patient undergoes a single-contrast
enema, their intestine is steadily filled with barium
to differentiate the colon’s markings. A normal result
displays uniform filling of the colon. As the barium is
expelled, the intestinal walls collapse. A normal result
on the x ray after defecation will show the intestinal
lining as having a standard, feathery appearance.
Accordingly, the double-contrast enema expands
the intestine which is already lined with a thin layer of
barium, but with air to display a detailed image of the
mucosal pattern. Varying positions taken by the
patient allow the barium to collect on the dependent
walls of the intestine by way of gravity.

Abnormal results
A barium enema allows abnormalities to appear on
an x ray that may aid in the diagnosis of several different
conditions. Although most colon cancers occur in the
rectosigmoid region, or upper part of the rectum and
adjoining portion of the sigmoid colon, and are better
detected with a different test called a proctosigmoidoscopy, an enema can identify other early signs of cancer.
Identification of polyps, diverticulosis, inflammatory disease, such as diverticulitis and ulcerative colitis
is attainable through a barium x ray. Structural
changes in the intestine, gastroenteritis, and some
cases of acute appendicitis may also be apparent by
viewing this x ray.

Barium enema

As the barium fills the intestine, x rays of the abdomen are taken to distinguish significant findings.There
are many ways to perform a barium enema. One way is
that shortly after filling, the rectal tube is removed and
the patient expels as much of the barium as possible.
Upon completing this, an additional x ray is taken, and
a double-contrast enema may follow. If this is done
immediately, a thin film of barium will remain in the
intestine, and air is then slowly injected to expand the
bowel lumen. Sometimes no x rays will be taken until
after the air is injected.

I Bartholin’s gland cyst

KEY TERMS

Definition

Marsupialization—Cutting out a wedge of the cyst
wall and putting in stitches so the cyst cannot reoccur.
Sitz bath—A warm bath in which just the buttocks
and genital area soak in water; used to reduce pain
and aid healing in the genital area.

A Bartholin’s gland cyst is a swollen fluid-filled
lump that develops from a blockage of one of the
Bartholin’s glands, which are small glands located on
each side of the opening to the vagina. Bartholin’s
gland cysts and abscesses are commonly found in
women of reproductive age, developing in approximately 2% of all women.

Window operation—Cutting out a large ovalshaped piece of the cyst wall and putting in stitches
to create a window so the cyst cannot reoccur.
Word catheter—A small rubber catheter with an
inflatable balloon tip that is inserted into a stab
incision in the cyst, after the contents of the cyst
have been drained.

Description
The Bartholin’s glands are located in the lips of the
labia that cover the vaginal opening. The glands (normally the size of a pea) provide moisture for the vulva
area. A Bartholin’s gland cyst may form in the gland itself
or in the duct draining the gland. A cyst normally does
not cause pain, grows slowly, and may go away without treatment. It usually ranges in size from 0.4-1.2 in.
(1–3 cm), although some may grow much larger.
If infected, a Bartholin’s gland cyst can form an
abscess that will increase in size over several days and
is very painful. In order to heal, a Bartholin’s gland
cyst usually must be drained.

normally occurring in the vagina. Over 60 types of
bacteria have been found in Bartholin’s gland abscesses.

Diagnosis
A Bartholin’s gland cyst or abscess is diagnosed
by a gynecological pelvic exam. If the cyst appears to
be infected, a culture is often performed to identify the
type of bacteria causing the abscess.

Causes and symptoms

Treatment

A Bartholin’s gland cyst occurs if the duct
becomes blocked for any reason, such as infection,
injury, or chronic inflammation. Very rarely a cyst is
caused by cancer, which usually occurs only in women
over the age of 40. In many cases, the cause of a
Bartholin’s gland cyst is unknown.

Treatment for this condition depends on the size
of the cyst, whether it is painful, and whether the cyst is
infected.

Symptoms of an uninfected Bartholin’s gland cyst
include a painless jump on one side of the vulva area
(most common symptom) and redness or swelling in
the vulva area.

watchful waiting by the woman and her health care
professional



soaking of the genital area with warm towel
compresses



soaking of the genital area in a sitz bath



mild discomfort

Symptoms of an abscessed Bartholin’s gland
include:

If the cyst is not infected, treatment options
include:



pain that occurs with walking, sitting, physical activity, or sexual intercourse



fever and chills

If the Bartholin’s gland is infected, there are several
treatments available to treat the abscess, including:



increased swelling in the vulva area over a two- to
four-day period



soaking of the genital area in a sitz bath

drainage from the cyst, normally occurring four to
five days after the swelling starts





treatment with antibiotics



use of prescription or non-prescription pain medication



incision and drainage, i.e., cutting into the cyst and
draining the fluid (not usually successful, as the cyst
often reoccurs)

Abscesses may be caused by sexually transmitted
bacteria, such as those causing chlamydial or gonococcal infections, while others are caused by bacteria

During surgical treatment, the area will be numbed
with a local anesthetic to reduce pain. General anesthesia may be used for treatment of an abscess, as the
procedure can be painful.
In a pregnant woman, surgical treatment of cysts
that are asymptomatic should be delayed until after
delivery to avoid the possibility of excessive bleeding.
However, if the Bartholin’s gland is infected and must
be drained, antibiotics and local anesthesia are generally considered safe.
If the cyst is caused by cancer, the gland must be
excised, and the woman should be under the care of a
gynecologist familiar with the treatment of this type of
cancer.

Alternative treatment
If a Bartholin’s gland cyst has no or mild symptoms, or has opened on its own to drain, a woman may
decide to use watchful waiting, warm sitz baths, and
non-prescription pain medication. If symptoms
become worse or do not improve, a health care professional should then be consulted.
Infected Bartholin’s glands should be evaluated
and treated by a health care professional.

Prognosis
A Bartholin’s gland cyst should respond to treatment in a few days. If an abscess requires surgery,
healing may take days to weeks, depending on the
size of the abscess and the type of surgical procedure
used. Most of the surgical procedures, except for incision and drainage, should be effective in preventing
recurring infections.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Prevention
There are few ways to prevent the formation of
Bartholin’s gland cysts or abscesses. However, as a
Bartholin’s gland abscess may be caused by a sexually
transmitted disease, the practice of safe sex is recommended. Using good hygiene, i.e., wiping front to back
after a bowel movement, is also recommended to prevent bacteria from the bowels from contaminating the
vaginal area.

Bartonella bacilliformis infection see
Bartonellosis

I Bartonellosis
Definition
Bartonellosis is an infectious bacterial disease
with an acute form (which has a sudden onset and
short course) and a chronic form (which has more
gradual onset and longer duration). The disease is
transmitted by sandflies and occurs in western South
America. Characterized by a form of red blood cell
deficiency (hemolytic anemia) and fever, the potentially fatal acute form is called Oroya fever or
Carrion’s disease. The chronic form is identified by
painful skin lesions.

Description
The acute form of the disease gets its name from an
outbreak that occurred in 1871 near La Oroya, Peru.
More than 7,000 people perished. Some survivors later
developed a skin disease, called verruga peruana
(Peruvian warts). These skin lesions were observed
prior to the 1871 outbreak–perhaps as far back as the
pre-Columbian era–but a connection to Oroya fever
was unknown. In 1885, a young medical researcher,
Daniel Carrion, inoculated himself with blood from a
lesion to study the course of the skin disease. When he
became ill with Oroya fever, the connection became
apparent. Oroya fever is often called Carrion’s disease
in honor of his fatal experiment.

Bartonellosis

KEY TERMS
Acute—Referring to the course of a disease, or
a phase of a disease, the short-term experience of
prominent symptoms.
Chronic—Referring to the course of a disease, or
a phase of a disease, the long-term experience of
prominent symptoms.
Erythrocytes—Red blood cells.
Hemolytic anemia—A form of erythrocyte deficiency
caused by the destruction of the red blood cells.
Host—The organism that harbors or nourishes
another organism (parasite). In bartonellosis, the
person infected with Bartonella basilliformis.
Vector—An organism, such as insects or rodents,
that can transmit disease to humans.

The bacteria, Bartonella bacilliformis, was isolated
by Alberto Barton in 1909, but wasn’t identified as the
cause of the fever until 1940. The Bartonella genus
includes at least 11 bacteria species, four of which
cause human diseases, including cat-scratch disease
and bacillary angiomatosis. However, bartonellosis
refers exclusively to the disease caused by B. bacilliformis. The disease is limited to a small area of the Andes
Mountains in western South America; nearly all cases
have been in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador. A large
outbreak involving thousands of people occurred in
1940–41, but bartonellosis has since occurred sporadically. Control of sandflies, the only known disease carrier
(vector), has been credited with managing the disease.

Causes and symptoms
Bartonellosis is transmitted by the nocturnal
sandfly and arises from infection with B. bacilliformis.
The sandfly, Lutzomyia verrucarum, dines on human
blood and, in so doing, can inject bacteria into the
bloodstream. The sandfly is found only in certain
areas of the Peruvian Andes; other, as-yet-unidentified
vectors are suspected in Ecuador and Colombia.

individuals may exhibit the characteristic lesions without ever experiencing the acute phase. Left untreated,
the lesions may last months or years. These lesions
resemble blood-filled blisters, up to 1.6 in (4 cm) in
diameter, and appear primarily on the head and limbs.
They can be painful to the touch and may bleed or
ulcerate.

Diagnosis
Bartonellosis is identified by symptoms and the
patient’s history, such as recent travel in areas where
bartonellosis occurs. Isolation of B. bacilliformis from
the bloodstream or lesions can confirm the diagnosis.

Treatment
Antibiotics are the mainstay of bartonellosis treatment. The bacteria are susceptible to several antibiotics,
including chloramphenicol, penicillins, and aminoglycosides. Blood transfusions may be necessary to treat the
anemia caused by bartonellosis.

Prognosis
Antibiotics have dramatically decreased the fatality associated with bartonellosis. Prior to the development of antibiotics, the fever was fatal in 40% of cases.
With antibiotic treatment, that rate has dropped to
8%. Fatalities can result from complications associated
with severe anemia and secondary infections. Once
the infection is halted, an individual can recover fully.

Prevention
Avoiding sandfly bites is the primary means of
prevention. Sandfly eradication programs have been
helpful in decreasing the sandfly population, and insect
repellant can be effective in preventing sandfly bites.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Definition
Battered child syndrome refers to injuries sustained by a child as a result of physical abuse, usually
inflicted by an adult caregiver. Alternative terms
include: shaken baby; shaken baby syndrome; child
abuse; and non-accidental trauma (NAT).

Description
Internal injuries, cuts, burns, bruises and broken or
fractured bones are all possible signs of battered child
syndrome. Emotional damage to a child is also often
the by-product of child abuse, which can result in serious
behavioral problems such as substance abuse or the
physical abuse of others. Approximately 14% of children in the United States are physically abused each
year, and an estimated 2,000 of those children die as a
result of the abuse. Between 1994-1995, 1.1 million cases
of child abuse were recorded in the United States; of that
number, 55% of the victims were less than a year old.

Causes and symptoms
Battered child syndrome (BCS) is found at every
level of society, although the incidence may be higher
in low-income households where adult caregivers suffer greater stress and social difficulties, without having
had the benefit of higher education. The child abuser
most often injures a child in the heat of anger, and was
often abused as a child himself. The incessant crying of
an infant or child may trigger abuse. Symptoms may
include a delayed visit to the emergency room with an
injured child; an implausible explanation of the cause
of a child’s injury; bruises that match the shape of a
hand, fist or belt; cigarette burns; scald marks; bite
marks; black eyes; unconsciousness; bruises around
the neck; and a bulging fontanel in infants.

Diagnosis
Battered child syndrome is most often diagnosed
by an emergency room physician or pediatrician, or by
teachers or social workers. Physical examination will
detect bruises, burns, swelling, retinal hemorrhages.
X rays, and other imaging techniques, such as MRI
or scans may confirm fractures or other internal injuries. The presence of injuries at different stages of
healing (i.e. having occurred at different times) is
nearly always indicative of BCS. Establishing the diagnosis is often hindered by the excessive cautiousness
of caregivers or by actual concealment of the true

origin of the childþs injuries, as a result of fear,
shame and avoidance or denial mechanisms.

Treatment
Medical treatment for battered child syndrome
will vary according to the type of injury incurred.
Counseling and the implementation of an intervention
plan for the child’s parents or guardians is necessary.
The child abuser may be incarcerated, and/or the
abused child removed from the home to prevent
further harm. Reporting child abuse to authorities is
mandatory for doctors, teachers, and childcare workers in most states as a way to prevent continued abuse.
Both physical and psychological therapy are often
recommended as treatment for the abused child.

Prognosis
The prognosis for battered child syndrome will
depend on the severity of injury, actions taken by the
authorities to ensure the future safety of the injured
child, and the willingness of parents or guardians to
seek counseling for themselves as well as for the child.

Prevention
Recognizing the potential for child abuse in a situation, and the seeking or offering of intervention and
counseling before battered child syndrome occurs is the
best way to prevent it. Signs that physical abuse may be
forthcoming include parental alcohol or substance
abuse; previous abuse of the child or the child’s siblings;
history of mental or emotional problems in parents;
parents abused as children; absence of visible parental
love or concern for the child; child’s hygiene neglected.

I Bed-wetting
Definition
Bed-wetting is the unintentional (involuntary) discharge of urine during the night. Although most children between the ages of three and five begin to stay
dry at night, the age at which children are physically
and emotionally ready to maintain complete bladder
control varies. Enuresis is a technical term that refers
to the continued, usually involuntary, passage of urine
during the night or the day after the age at which
control is expected.

Description
Most children wet the bed occasionally, and definitions of the age and frequency at which bed-wetting
becomes a medical problem vary somewhat. Many
researchers consider bed-wetting normal until age 6.
About 10% of 6-year-old children wet the bed about
once a month. More boys than girls have this problem.
The American Psychiatric Association, however,
defines enuresis as repeated voiding of urine into the
bed or clothes at age five or older. The wetting is usually
involuntary but in some cases it is intentional. For a
diagnosis of enuresis, wetting must occur twice a week
for at least three months with no underlying physiological cause. Enuresis, both nighttime (nocturnal) and
daytime (diurnal), at age five affects 7% of boys and
3% of girls. By age 10, it affects 3% of boys and 2% of
girls; only 1% of adolescents experience enuresis.
Enuresis is divided into two classes. A child with
primary enuresis has never established bladder control. A child with secondary enuresis begins to wet
after a prolonged dry period. Some children have
both nocturnal and diurnal enuresis.

Causes and symptoms
The causes of bed-wetting are not entirely known.
It tends to run in families. Most children with primary

enuresis have a close relative–a parent, aunt, or uncle–
who also had the disorder. About 70% of children
with two parents who wet the bed will also wet the
bed. Twin studies have shown that both of a pair of
identical twins experience enuresis more often than
both of a pair of fraternal twins.
Sometimes bed-wetting can be caused by a serious
medical problem like diabetes, sickle-cell anemia, or
epilepsy. Snoring and episodes of interrupted breathing during sleep (sleep apnea) occasionally contribute
to bed-wetting problems. Enlarged adenoids can cause
these conditions. Other physiological problems, such
as urinary tract infection, severe constipation, or spinal
cord injury, can cause bed-wetting.
Children who wet the bed frequently may have a
smaller than normal functional bladder capacity.
Functional bladder capacity is the amount of urine a
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Parents often report that their bed-wetting child is
an extremely sound sleeper and difficult to wake.
However, several research studies found that bedwetting children have normal sleep patterns and that
bed-wetting can occur in any stage of sleep.
Recent medical research has found that many
children who wet the bed may have a deficiency of
an important hormone known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH helps to concentrate urine during
sleep hours, meaning that the urine contains less
water and therefore takes up less space. This decreased
volume of water usually prevents the child’s bladder
from overfilling during the night, unless the child
drank a lot just before going to bed. Testing of
many bed-wetting children has shown that these
children do not have the usual increase in ADH during sleep. Children who wet the bed, therefore, often
produce more urine during the hours of sleep than
their bladders can hold. If they do not wake up, the
bladder releases the excess urine and the child wets
the bed.
Research demonstrates that in most cases bedwetting does not indicate that the child has a physical
or psychological problem. Children who wet the bed
usually have normal-sized bladders and have sleep
patterns that are no different from those of non-bedwetting children. Sometimes emotional stress, such as
the birth of a sibling, a death in the family, or separation from the family, may be associated with the onset
of bed-wetting in a previously toilet-trained child.
Daytime wetting, however, may indicate that the problem has a physical cause.
While most children have no long-term problems
as a result of bed-wetting, some children may develop
psychological problems. Low self-esteem may occur
when these children, who already feel embarrassed,
are further humiliated by angry or frustrated parents
who punish them or who are overly aggressive about
toilet training. The problem can by aggravated when
playmates tease or when social activities such as sleepaway camp are avoided for fear of teasing.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis
If a child continues to wet the bed after the age of
six, parents may feel the need to seek evaluation and
diagnosis by the family doctor or a children’s specialist (pediatrician). Typically, before the doctor can
make a diagnosis, a thorough medical history is
obtained. Then the child receives a physical examination, appropriate laboratory tests, including a urine
test (urinalysis), and, if necessary, radiologic studies
(such as x rays).
If the child is healthy and no physical problem is
found, which is the case 90% of the time, the doctor
may not recommend treatment but rather may provide the parents and the child with reassurance, information, and advice.

Treatment
Occasionally a doctor will determine that the problem is serious enough to require treatment. Standard
treatments for bed-wetting include bladder training
exercises, motivational therapy, drug therapy, psychotherapy, and diet therapy.
Bladder training exercises are based on the theory
that those who wet the bed have small functional
bladder capacity. Children are told to drink a large
quantity of water and to try to prolong the periods
between urinations. These exercises are designed to
increase bladder capacity but are only successful in
resolving bed-wetting in a small number of patients.
In motivational therapy, parents attempt to
encourage the child to combat bed-wetting, but the
child must want to achieve success. Positive reinforcement, such as praise or rewards for staying dry, can
help improve self-image and resolve the condition.
Punishment for ‘‘wet’’ nights will hamper the child’s
self-esteem and compound the problem.
The following motivational techniques are commonly used:


Behavior modification. This method of therapy is
aimed at helping children take responsibility for their
nighttime bladder control by teaching new behaviors.
For example, children are taught to use the bathroom
before bedtime and to avoid drinking fluids after
dinner. While behavior modification generally produces good results, it is long-term treatment.



Alarms. This form of therapy uses a sensor placed
in the child’s pajamas or in a bed pad. This sensor
triggers an alarm that wakes the child at the first sign
of wetness. If the child is awakened, he or she can then
go to the bathroom and finish urinating. The intention
505

Bed-wetting

person can hold in the bladder before feeling a strong
urge to urinate. When functional capacity is small, the
bladder will not hold all the urine produced during the
night. Tests have shown that bladder size in these
children is normal. Nevertheless, they experience frequent strong urges to urinate. Such children urinate
often during the daytime and may wet several times at
night. Although a small functional bladder capacity
may be caused by a developmental delay, it may also
be that the child’s habit of voiding frequently slows
bladder development.

Bed-wetting

is to condition a response to awaken when the bladder
is full. Bed-wetting alarms require the motivation
of both parents and children. They are considered
the most effective form of treatment now available.

Common homeopathic remedies used in this treatment
include Causticum, Lycopodium, and Pulsatilla.

A number of drugs are also used to treat bedwetting. These medications are usually fast acting;
children often respond to them within the first week
of treatment. Among the drugs commonly used are a
nasal spray of desmopressin acetate (DDAVP), a substance similar to the hormone that helps regulate urine
production; and imipramine hydrochloride, a drug
that helps to increase bladder capacity. Studies show
that imipramine is effective for as many as 50% of
patients. However, children often wet the bed again
after the drug is discontinued, and it has some side
effects. Some bed-wetting with an underlying physical
cause can be treated by surgical procedures. These
causes include enlarged adenoids that cause sleep
apnea, physical defects in the urinary system, or a
spinal tumor.

Hypnosis is another approach that is being used
successfully by practitioners trained in this therapy. It
trains the child to awaken and go to the bathroom
when his or her bladder feels full. Hypnosis is less
expensive, less time-consuming, and less dangerous
than most approaches; it has virtually no side effects.
Recent medical studies show that hypnotherapy can
work quickly–within four to six sessions.

Psychotherapy is indicated when the child exhibits
signs of severe emotional distress in response to events
such as a death in the family, the birth of a new child, a
change in schools, or divorce. Psychotherapy is also
indicated if a child shows signs of persistently low selfesteem or depression.
In rare cases, allergies or intolerances to certain
foods–such as dairy products, citrus products, or chocolate–can cause bed-wetting. When children have food
sensitivities, bed-wetting may be helped by discovering
the substances that trigger the allergic response and
eliminating these substances from the child’s diet.

Hypnosis

Prognosis
Occasional bed-wetting is not a disease and it does
not have a ‘‘cure.’’ If the child has no underlying
physical or psychological problem that is causing the
bed-wetting, in most cases he or she will outgrow the
condition without treatment. About 15% of bedwetters
become dry each year after age 6. If bed-wetting is
frequent, accompanied by daytime wetting, or falls
into the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic
definition of enuresis, a doctor should be consulted. If
treatment is indicated, it usually successfully resolves
the problem. Marked improvement is seen in about
75% of cases treated with wetness alarms.

Prevention
Although preventing a child from wetting the bed
is not always possible, parents can take steps to help
the child keep the bed dry at night. These steps include:


Encouraging and praising the child for staying dry
instead of punishing when the child wets.



Reminding the child to urinate before going to bed, if
he or she feels the need.



Limiting liquid intake at least two hours before
bedtime.

Alternative treatment
A number of alternative treatments are available
for bed-wetting.
Massage
According to practitioners of this technique, pressure applied to various points on the body may help
alleviate the condition. Acupressure or massage, when
done by a trained therapist, may also be helpful in bedwetting caused by a neurologic problem.
Herbal and homeopathic remedies
Some herbal remedies, such as horsetail (Equisetum
arvense) have also been used to treat bed-wetting. A
trained homeopathic practitioner, working at the constitutional level, will seek to rebalance the child’s vital force,
eliminating the imbalanced behavior of bed-wetting.

Bedsores

I Bedsores
Definition
Bedsores are also called decubitus ulcers, pressure
ulcers, or pressure sores. These tender or inflamed
patches develop when skin covering a weight-bearing
part of the body is squeezed between bone and another
body part, or a bed, chair, splint, or other hard object.

Description
Each year, about one million people in the
United States develop bedsores ranging from mild
inflammation to deep wounds that involve muscle
and bone. This often painful condition usually starts
with shiny red skin that quickly blisters and deteriorates into open sores that can harbor life-threatening
infection.
Bedsores are not cancerous or contagious. They
are most likely to occur in people who must use wheelchairs or who are confined to bed. In 1992, the federal
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research reported
that bedsores afflict:





60% of quadriplegics

prolonged bed rest, especially in unsanitary conditions or with wet or wrinkled sheets



spinal cord injury

The Agency also noted that 65% of elderly people
hospitalized with broken hips develop bedsores and
that doctors fees for treatment of bedsores amounted
to $2,900 per person.
Bedsores are most apt to develop on the:


ankles



back of the head



heels



hips



knees



lower back



shoulder blades



spine

People over the age of 60 are more likely than
younger people to develop bedsores. Risk is also
increased by:

Causes and symptoms
Bedsores most often develop when constant pressure pinches tiny blood vessels that deliver oxygen and
nutrients to the skin. When skin is deprived of oxygen
and nutrients for as little as an hour, areas of tissue can
die and bedsores can form.
Slight rubbing or friction against the skin can
cause minor pressure ulcers. They can also develop
when a patient stretches or bends blood vessels by
slipping into a different position in a bed or chair.
Urine, feces, or other moisture increases the risk
of skin infection, and people who are unable to move
or recognize internal cues to shift position have a
greater than average risk of developing bedsores.
Other risk factors include:


malnutrition



anemia (lack of red blood cells)



atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries)



diabetes or other conditions that make skin more
susceptible to infection



diuse atrophy (muscle loss or weakness from lack of
use)



diminished sensation or lack of feeling



infection

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

507

Bedsores

Diagnosis
Bedsores usually follow six stages:


redness of skin



redness, swelling, and possible peeling of outer layer
of skin



dead skin, draining wound, and exposed layer of fat



tissue death through skin and fat, to muscle



inner fat and muscle death



destruction of bone, bone, infection, fracture, and
blood infection

Treatment
Prompt medical attention can prevent surface
pressure sores from deepening into more serious infections. For mild bedsores, treatment involves relieving
pressure, keeping the wound clean and moist, and
keeping the area around the ulcer clean and dry.
Antiseptics, harsh soaps, and other skin cleansers can
damage new tissue, so a saline solution should be used
to cleanse the wound whenever a fresh non-stick dressing is applied.
The patient’s doctor may prescribe infectionfighting antibiotics, special dressings or drying agents,
or lotions or ointments to be applied to the wound in a
thin film three or four times a day. Warm whirlpool
treatments are sometimes recommended for sores on
the arm, hand, foot, or leg.
In a procedure called debriding, a scalpel may be
used to remove dead tissue or other debris from the
wound. Deep, ulcerated sores that don’t respond to
other therapy may require skin grafts or plastic surgery.
A doctor should be notified whenever a person:

vitamins or minerals should never be used without a
doctor’s approval.
A poultice made of equal parts of powdered slippery elm (Ulmus fulva), marsh mallow (Althaea officinalis), and echinacea (Echinacea spp.) blended with a small
amount of hot water can relieve minor inflammation.
An infection-fighting rinse can be made by diluting two
drops of essential tea tree oil (Melaleuca spp.) in eight
ounces of water. An herbal tea made from the calendula
(Calendula officinalis) can act as an antiseptic and
wound healing agent. Calendula cream can also be used.
Contrasting hot and cold local applications can
increase circulation to the area and help flush out
waste products, speeding the healing process. The temperatures should be extreme (hot hot and ice cold), yet
tolerable to the skin. Hot compresses should be applied
for three minutes, followed by 30 seconds of cold compress application, repeating the cycle three times. The
cycle should always end with the cold compress.

Prevention
It is usually possible to prevent bedsores from
developing or worsening. The patient should be
inspected regularly; should bathe or shower every
day, using warm water and mild soap; and should
avoid cold or dry air. A bedridden patient should be
repositioned at least once every two hours while
awake. A person who uses a wheelchair should shift
his weight every 10 or 15 minutes, or be helped to
reposition himself at least once an hour. It is important to lift, rather than drag, a person being repositioned. Bony parts of the body should not be
massaged. Even slight friction can remove the top
layer of skin and damage blood vessels beneath it.



If the patient is bedridden, sensitive body parts
can be protected by:



sheepskin pads





special cushions placed on top of a mattress



a water-filled mattress



a variable-pressure mattress whose sections can be
individually inflated or deflated to redistribute
pressure.

Immediate medical attention is required whenever:


skin turns black or becomes inflamed, tender, swollen, or warm to the touch.



the patient develops a fever during treatment.



the sore contains pus or has a foul-smelling discharge.

With proper treatment, bedsores should begin to
heal two to four weeks after treatment begins.

Alternative treatment
Zinc and vitamins A, C, E, and B complex help
skin repair injuries and stay healthy, but large doses of
508

Pillows or foam wedges can prevent a bedridden
patient’s ankles from irritating each other, and pillows
placed under the legs from mid-calf to ankle can raise
the heels off the bed. Raising the head of the bed
slightly and briefly can provide relief, but raising the
head of the bed more than 30 degrees can cause the
patient to slide, thereby causing damage to skin and
tiny blood vessels.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Prognosis
Bedsores can usually be cured, but about 60,000
deaths a year are attributed to complications caused
by bedsores. Bedsores can be slow to heal. Without
proper treatment, they can lead to:


gangrene (tissue death)



osteomyelitis (infection of the bone beneath the
bedsore)



sepsis (tissue-destroying bacterial infection)



other localized or systemic infections that slow the
healing process, increase the cost of treatment,
lengthen hospital or nursing home stays, or cause
death

Description
Behcet’s syndrome is a chronic disease that
involves multiple body systems. The disease is named
for a Turkish dermatologist, Hulusi Behcet, who first
reported a patient with recurrent mouth and genital
ulcers along with uveitis in 1937. The disease occurs
worldwide, but is most prevalent in Japan, the Middle
East, and in the Mediterranean region. There is a
wider prevalence among males than females in a
ratio of two to one.

Causes and symptoms
The cause of Behcet’s syndrome is unknown.
Symptoms include recurring ulcers in the mouth or
the genital area, skin lesions, arthritis that affects
mainly the knees and ankles, pain and irritation in
the eyes, and fever. The mouth and genital ulcers tend
to occur in multiples and can be quite painful. In the
mouth, these ulcers are generally found on the tongue, gums, and the inside of the lips or jaws. In the
genital area, the ulcers usually occur on the penis and
scrotum in males and on the vulva of women. The eye
inflammation can lead to blindness.

I Behcet’s syndrome
Definition
A group of symptoms that affect a variety of body
systems, including musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal,
and the central nervous system. These symptoms
include ulceration of the mouth or the genital area,
skin lesions, and inflammation of the uvea (an area
around the pupil of the eye).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis
Because Behcet’s syndrome is a multisystem disease, it is difficult to diagnose. International criteria
have been proposed to assist in classifying this disease.
There is no one diagnostic feature of this disease, so
diagnosis depends on grouping together enough
symptoms in order to identify the disease. Symptoms
of Behcet’s syndrome also occur in other diseases, so it
is often necessary to rule out the other diseases before
a definitive diagnosis can be reached.

Treatment
Some of the current drugs used to treat Behcet’s
syndrome include corticosteroids, cyclosporine,
azathioprine, chlorambucil, interferon alpha, thalidomide, levamisole and pulse cyclophosphamide.

Prognosis
The prognosis for Behcet’s syndrome is generally
poor. There has been a documented case of Behcet’s
lasting for 17 years. Although the disease is considered
painful but not fatal, when the central nervous system is
involved there is usually severe disability and death
often occurs. The condition is usually chronic, although
there can be remissions during the course of the disease.
There is no predictable method to determine which

A person who uses a wheelchair should be encouraged to sit up as straight as possible. Pillows behind
the head and between the legs can help prevent bedsores, as can a special cushion placed on the chair seat.
Donut-shaped cushions should not be used because
they restrict blood flow and cause tissues to swell.

Description
Bejel has many other names depending on the
locality: siti, dichuchwa, njovera, belesh, and skerljevo
are some of the names. It is most commonly found in
the Middle East (Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq), Africa,
central Asia, and Australia. Bejel is related to yaws
and pinta, but has different symptoms.

I Bejel

Treponema pallidum, the bacteria that causes
bejel, is very closely related to the one that causes the
sexually transmitted form of syphilis, but transmission
is very different. In bejel, transmission is by direct
contact, with broken skin or contaminated hands, or
indirectly by sharing drinking vessels and eating utensils. T. pallidum is passed on mostly between children
living in poverty in very unsanitary environments and
with poor hygiene.
The skin, bones, and mucous membranes are
affected by bejel. Patches and ulcerated sores are common in the mouth, throat, and nasal passages.
Gummy lesions may form, even breaking through
the palate. Other findings may include a region of
swollen lymph nodes and deep bone pain in the legs.
Eventually, bones may become deformed.

Diagnosis
T. pallidum can be detected by microscopic study
of samples taken from the sores or lymph fluid.
However, since antibody tests don’t distinguish
between the types of syphilis, specific diagnosis of the
type of syphilis depends on the patient’s history, symptoms, and environment.

Treatment
Large doses of benzathine penicillin G given by
injection into the muscle can cure this disease in any
stage, although it may take longer and require
additional doses in later stages. If penicillin cannot
be given, the alternative is tetracycline. Since tetracycline can permanently discolor new teeth still forming,
it is usually not prescribed for children unless no viable
alternative is available.

Definition
Bejel, also known as endemic syphilis, is a
chronic but curable disease, seen mostly in children
in arid regions. Unlike the better-known venereal
510

Prognosis
Bejel is completely curable with antibiotic
treatment.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Endemic disease—An infectious disease that
occurs frequently in a specific geographical locale.
The disease often occurs in cycles. Influenza is an
example of an endemic disease.
Lymph—This is a clear, colorless fluid found in
lymph vessels and nodes. The lymph nodes contain
organisms that destroy bacteria and other disease
causing organisms (also called pathogens).
Syphilis—This disease occurs in two forms. One is
a sexually transmitted disease caused by a bacteria.
The second form is not sexually transmitted, but
passed on by direct contact with the patient or
through use of shared food dishes and utensils.

Prevention
The World Health Organization (WHO) has
worked with many countries to prevent this and
other diseases, and the number of cases has been
reduced somewhat. Widespread use of penicillin has
been responsible for reducing the number of existing
cases, but the only way to eliminate bejel is by improving living and sanitation conditions.

I Bence Jones protein test
Definition
Bence Jones proteins are small proteins (light
chains of immunoblobulin) found in the urine.
Testing for these proteins is done to diagnose and
monitor multiple myeloma and other similar diseases.

Purpose
Bence Jones proteins are considered the first
tumor marker. A tumor marker is a substance, made
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

by the body, that is linked to a certain cancer, or
malignancy. Bence Jones proteins are made by plasma
cells, a type of white blood cell. The presence of these
proteins in a person’s urine is associated with a malignancy of plasma cells.
Multiple myeloma, a tumor of plasma cells, is the
disease most often linked with Bence Jones proteins.
The amount of Bence Jones proteins in the urine indicates how much tumor is present. Physicians use Bence
Jones proteins testing to diagnose the disease as well as
to check how well the disease is responding to
treatment.
Other diseases involving cancerous or excessive
growth of plasma cells or cells similar to plasma cells
can cause Bence Jones proteins in the urine. These
diseases include: Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia,
some lymphomas and leukemias, osteogenic sarcoma,
cryoglobulinemia, malignant B-cell disease, amyloidosis,
light chain disease, and cancer that has spread to bone.

Description
Urine is the best specimen in which to look for
Bence Jones proteins. Proteins are usually too large to
move through a healthy kidney, from the blood into
the urine. Bence Jones proteins are an exception. They
are small enough to move quickly and easily through
the kidney into the urine.
A routine urinalysis will not detect Bence Jones
proteins. There are several methods used by laboratories to detect and measure these proteins. The classic
Bence Jones reaction involves heating urine to 140 8F
(608C). At this temperature, the Bence Jones proteins
will clump. The clumping disappears if the urine is
further heated to boiling and reappears when the
urine is cooled. Other clumping procedures using
salts, acids, and other chemicals are also used to detect
these proteins. These types of test will reveal whether
or not Bence Jones proteins are present, but not how
much is present.
A more complex procedure is done to measure the
exact amount of Bence Jones proteins. This procedure–immunoelectrophoresis–is usually done on
urine that has been collected for 24-hours.
The test is covered by insurance when medically
necessary. Results are usually available within several
days.

Preparation
Urine is usually collected throughout a 24-hour
time period. A person is given a large container in

which to collect the urine. The urine should be refrigerated until it is brought to the laboratory or physician’s office.

Normal results
Bence Jones proteins normally are not present in
the urine.

Abnormal results
Bence Jones proteins are present in 50–80% of
people with multiple myeloma. People with other
malignancies also can have a positive Bence Jones
proteins test, but less frequently.
Certain nonmalignant diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and
chronic renal insufficiency, can have Bence Jones proteins in the urine. High doses of penicillin or aspirin
before collecting the urine can give a false positive
result.

I Bender-Gestalt test
Definition
The Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test (or BenderGestalt test) is a psychological assessment used to
evaluate visual-motor functioning, visual-perceptual
skills, neurological impairment, and emotional disturbances in children and adults ages three and older.
512

The Bender-Gestalt is used to evaluate visualmotor maturity and to screen children for developmental delays. The test is also used to assess brain
damage and neurological deficits. Individuals who
have suffered a traumatic brain injury may be given
the Bender-Gestalt as part of a battery of neuropsychological measures, or tests.
The Bender-Gestalt is sometimes used in conjunction with other personality tests to determine the presence of emotional and psychiatric disturbances such
as schizophrenia.

Precautions
Psychometric testing requires a clinically trained
examiner. The Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test
should be administered and interpreted by a trained
psychologist or psychiatrist. The Bender-Gestalt should
always be employed as only one element of a complete
battery of psychological or developmental tests, and
should never be used alone as the sole basis for a
diagnosis.

Description
The original Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test was
developed in 1938 by psychiatrist Lauretta Bender.
There are several different versions of the BenderGestalt available today (i.e., the Bender-Gestalt test;
Modified Version of the Bender-Gestalt test for
Preschool and Primary School Children; the Hutt
Adaptation of the Bender-Gestalt test; the Bender
Visual Motor Gestalt test for Children; the BenderGestalt test for Young Children; the Watkins BenderGestalt Scoring System; the Canter Background
Interference Procedure for the Bender-Gestalt test).
All use the same basic test materials, but vary in their
scoring and interpretation methods.
The standard Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test
consists of nine figures, each on its own 3 x 5 card. An
examiner presents each figure to the test subject one at
a time and asks the subject to copy it onto a single
piece of blank paper. The only instruction given to the
subject is that he or she should make the best reproduction of the figure possible. The test is not timed,
although standard administration time is typically
10-20 minutes. After testing is complete, the results
are scored based on accuracy and organization.
Interpretation depends on the form of the test in use.
Common features considered in evaluating the drawings are rotation, distortion, symmetry, and perseveration. As an example, a patient with frontal lobe injury
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Neuropsychological test—A test or assessment
given to diagnose a brain disorder or disease.
Perserveration—The persistence of a repetitive
response after the cause of the response has been
removed, or the response continues to different
stimuli.
Visual-motor skills—Hand-eye coordination; in
the Bender-Gestalt test, visual-motor skills are measured by the subject’s ability to accurately perceive
and then reproduce figures.
Visual-perceptual skills—The capacity of the mind
and the eye to ‘‘see’’ something as it objectively
exists.

I Benzodiazepines
Definition
Benzodiazepines are medicines that help relieve
nervousness, tension, and other symptoms by slowing
the central nervous system.

Purpose
may reproduce the same pattern over and over
(perserveration).
The Bender-Gestalt can also be administered in a
group setting. In group testing, the figures are shown
to test subjects with a slide projector, in a test booklet,
or on larger versions of the individual test cards. Both
the individual and group- administered BenderGestalt evaluation may take place in either an outpatient or hospital setting. Patients should check
with their insurance plans to determine if these or
other mental health services are covered.

Normal results
Children normally improve in this test as they age,
but, because of the complexity of the scoring process,
results for the Bender-Gestalt should only be interpreted by a clinically trained psychologist or
psychiatrist.

Benzodiazepines are a type of antianxiety drugs.
While anxiety is a normal response to stressful situations, some people have unusually high levels of anxiety that can interfere with everyday life. For these
people, benzodiazepines can help bring their feelings
under control. The medicine can also relieve troubling
symptoms of anxiety, such as pounding heartbeat,
breathing problems, irritability, nausea, and faintness.
Physicians may sometimes prescribe these drugs for
other conditions, such as muscle spasms, epilepsy and
other seizure disorders, phobias, panic disorder, withdrawal from alcohol, and sleeping problems. However,
this medicine should not be used every day for sleep
problems that last more than a few days. If used this
way, the drug loses its effectiveness within a few weeks.

Description
The family of antianxiety drugs known as benzodiazepines includes alprazolam (Xanax), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam
(Ativan). These medicines take effect fairly quickly,
starting to work within an hour after they are taken.
Benzodiazepines are available only with a physician’s
prescription and are available in tablet, capsule,
liquid, or injectable forms.

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
benzodiazepine, its strength, and the condition for
which it is being taken. Doses may be different for
different people. Check with the physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the correct dosage.

KEY TERMS

Benzodiazepines

KEY TERMS
Anxiety—Worry or tension in response to real or
imagined stress, danger, or dreaded situations.
Physical reactions, such as fast pulse, sweating, trembling, fatigue, and weakness may accompany anxiety.
Asthma—A disease in which the air passages of the
lungs become inflamed and narrowed.
Bronchitis—Inflammation of the air passages of the

Glaucoma—A condition in which pressure in the
eye is abnormally high. If not treated, glaucoma
may lead to blindness.
Myasthenia gravis—A chronic disease with symptoms that include muscle weakness and sometimes
paralysis.
Panic disorder—A disorder in which people have
sudden and intense attacks of anxiety in certain
situations. Symptoms such as shortness of breath,
sweating, dizziness, chest pain, and extreme fear
often accompany the attacks.
Phobia—An intense, abnormal, or illogical fear of
something specific, such as heights or open spaces.
Porphyria—A disorder in which porphyrins build
up in the blood and urine.
Porphyrin—A type of pigment found in living
things.
Seizure—A sudden attack, spasm, or convulsion.
Sleep apnea—A condition in which a person temporarily stops breathing during sleep.
Withdrawal symptoms—A group of physical or
mental symptoms that may occur when a person
suddenly stops using a drug to which he or she has
become dependent.

Always take benzodiazepines exactly as directed.
Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do not
take the drug for longer than directed. If the medicine
does not seem to be working, check with the physician
514

who prescribed it. Do not increase the dose or stop
taking the medicine unless the physician says to do so.
Stopping the drug suddenly may cause withdrawal
symptoms, especially if it has been taken in large
doses or over a long period. People who are taking
the medicine for seizure disorders may have seizures
if they stop taking it suddenly. If it is necessary to stop
taking the medicine, check with a physician for directions on how to stop. The physician may recommend
tapering down gradually to reduce the chance of withdrawal symptoms or other problems.

Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking benzodiazepines is important, especially during the first few
months of treatment. The physician will check to make
sure the medicine is working as it should and will note
unwanted side effects.
People who take benzodiazepines to relieve nervousness, tension, or symptoms of panic disorder
should check with their physicians every two to three
months to make sure they still need to keep taking the
medicine.
Patients who are taking benzodiazepines for sleep
problems should check with their physicians if they are
not sleeping better within 7-10 days. Sleep problems
that last longer than this may be a sign of another
medical problem.
People who take this medicine to help them sleep
may have trouble sleeping when they stop taking the
medicine. This effect should last only a few nights.
Some people, especially older people, feel
drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, or less alert when using
benzodiazepines. The drugs may also cause clumsiness or unsteadiness. When the medicine is taken at
bedtime, these effects may even occur the next morning. Anyone who takes these drugs should not drive,
use machines or do anything else that might be
dangerous until they have found out how the drugs
affect them.
Benzodiazepines may also cause behavior changes
in some people, similar to those seen in people who act
differently when they drink alcohol. More extreme
changes, such as confusion, agitation, and hallucinations, also are possible. Anyone who starts having
strange or unusual thoughts or behavior while taking
this medicine should get in touch with his or her
physician.
Because benzodiazepines work on the central nervous system, they may add to the effects of alcohol and
other drugs that slow down the central nervous
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Some benzodiazepines may change the results of
certain medical tests. Before having medical tests, anyone taking this medicine should alert the health care
professional in charge.
Children are generally more sensitive than adults
to the effects of benzodiazepines. This sensitivity may
increase the chance of side effects.
Older people are more sensitive than younger
adults to the effects of this medicine and may be at
greater risk for side effects. Older people who take
these drugs to help them sleep may be drowsy during
the day. Older people also increase their risk of falling
and injuring themselves when they take these drugs.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if
they take benzodiazepines. Before taking these drugs,
be sure to let the physician know about any of these
conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reac-

tions to benzodiazepines or other mood-altering
drugs in the past should let his or her physician know
before taking the drugs again. The physician should
also be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
PREGNANCY. Some benzodiazepines increase the

likelihood of birth defects. Using these medicines during pregnancy may also cause the baby to become
dependent on them and to have withdrawal symptoms
after birth. When taken late in pregnancy or around
the time of labor and delivery, these drugs can cause
other problems in the newborn baby, such as
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

weakness, breathing problems, slow heartbeat, and
body temperature problems.
BREASTFEEDING. Benzodiazepines may pass into
breast milk and cause problems in babies whose
mothers taken the medicine. These problems include
drowsiness, breathing problems, and slow heartbeat.
Women who are breastfeeding their babies should not
use this medicine without checking with their
physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using benzodiazepines, people with any of these medical problems should make sure their physicians are aware of
their conditions:


current or past drug or alcohol abuse



depression



severe mental illness



epilepsy or other seizure disorders



swallowing problems



chronic lung disease such as emphysema, asthma, or
chronic bronchitis

kidney disease



liver disease



brain disease



glaucoma



hyperactivity



myasthenia gravis



porphyria



sleep apnea

USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking benzodiazepines with certain other drugs may affect the way the
drugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.

Side effects
The most common side effects are dizziness, lightheadedness, drowsiness, clumsiness, unsteadiness, and
slurred speech. These problems usually go away as the
body adjusts to the drug and do not require medical
treatment unless they persist or they interfere with
normal activities.
More serious side effects are not common, but
may occur. If any of the following side effects occur,
check with the physician who prescribed the medicine
as soon as possible:


behavior changes



memory problems



difficulty concentrating

system, such as antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy
medicine, sleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants. They
may also add to the effects of anesthetics, including
those used for dental procedures. These effects may
last several days after treatment with benzodiazepines
ends. The combined effects of benzodiazepines and
alcohol or other CNS depressants (drugs that slow the
central nervous system) can be very dangerous, leading
to unconsciousness or, rarely, even death. Anyone taking benzodiazepines should not drink alcohol and
should check with his or her physician before using
any CNS depressants. Taking an overdose of benzodiazepines can also cause unconsciousness and possibly
death. Anyone who shows signs of an overdose or of the
effects of combining benzodiazepines with alcohol or
other drugs should get immediate emergency help.
Warning signs include slurred speech or confusion,
severe drowsiness, staggering, and profound weakness.

other medicines. When this happens, the effects of
one or both of the drugs may change or the risk
of side effects may be greater. Anyone who takes
benzodiazepines should let the physician know all
other medicines he or she is taking. Among the drugs
that may interact with benzodiazepines are:

Central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as
medicine for allergies, colds, hay fever, and asthma;
sedatives; tranquilizers; prescription pain medicine;
muscle relaxants; medicine for seizures; sleep aids;
barbiturates; and anesthetics.

Medicines other than those listed above may
interact with benzodiazepines. Be sure to check with
a physician or pharmacist before combining benzodiazepines with any other prescription or nonprescription
(over-the-counter) medicine.

Bereavement refers to the period of mourning and
grief following the death of a beloved person or animal. The English word bereavement comes from an
ancient Germanic root word meaning ‘‘to rob’’ or ‘‘to
seize by violence.’’ Mourning is the word that is used to
describe the public rituals or symbols of bereavement,
such as holding funeral services, wearing black clothing, closing a place of business temporarily, or lowering a flag to half mast. Grief refers to one’s personal
experience of loss; it includes physical symptoms as
well as emotional and spiritual reactions to the loss.
While public expressions of mourning are usually
time-limited, grief is a process that takes most people
several months or years to work through.

Description
Bereavement is a highly individual as well as a
complex experience. It is increasingly recognized that
no two people respond the same way to the losses
associated with the death of a loved one. People’s
reactions to a death are influenced by such factors
as ethnic or religious traditions; personal beliefs
about life after death; the type of relationship ended
by death (relative, friend, colleague, etc.); the cause of
death; the person’s age at death; whether the death
was sudden or expected; and many others. In addition, the death of a loved one inevitably confronts
adults (and older adolescents) with the fact that they
too will die. As a result of this variety and emotional
complexity, most doctors and other counselors advise
people to trust their own feelings about bereavement,0 and grieve in the way that seems most helpful
to them.
It is also increasingly understood in the early
2000s that people can experience bereavement with
regard to other losses. Some examples of these
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Zalubowski. AP/Wide World Photos. Reproduced by permission.)

so-called ‘‘silent losses’’ include miscarriages in early
pregnancy, the death of a child in the womb shortly
before birth, or the news that a loved one has
Alzheimer’s disease or another illness that slowly
destroys their personality. In addition, many counselors recognize that bereavement has two dimensions,
the actual loss and the symbolic losses. For example, a
person whose teenage son or daughter is killed in an
accident suffers a series of symbolic losses—knowing
that their child will never graduate from high school,
get married, or have children—as well as the actual
loss of the adolescent to death.

Causes and symptoms
Causes
The immediate cause of bereavement is usually
the death of a loved friend or relative. There are a
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



The relationship with the dead person was a source
of pain rather than love and support. Examples
would include an abusive parent or spouse.



The person died in military service or in a natural,
transportation, or workplace disaster. Bereavement in
these cases is often made more difficult by intrusive
news reporters as well as anxiety over the loved one’s
possible physical or mental suffering prior to death.



The person was murdered. Survivors of homicide
victims often find the criminal justice system as well
as the media frustrating and upsetting.



The person is missing and presumed dead but their
death has not been verified. As a result, friends and
relatives may alternate between grief and hope that
the person is still alive.



The person committed suicide. Survivors may feel
guilt over their inability to foresee or prevent the
suicide, shame that the death was self-inflicted, or
anger at the person who committed suicide.



The relationship with the dead person cannot be
openly acknowledged. This situation often leads to
what is called disenfranchised grief. The most common instances are homosexual or extramarital sexual
relationships that have been kept secret for the sake
of spouses or other family members.



The loved one was an animal rather than a human
being. Western societies are only beginning to accept
that adults as well as children can grieve for a dead
animal; many adults still feel that there is ‘‘something wrong’’ about grieving for their pet. The question of euthanasia may be an additional source of
sorrow; even when the pet is terminally ill, many
people are very uneasy about making the decision
to end its life.
Symptoms

Bereavement typically affects a person’s physical
well-being as well as emotions. Common symptoms of
grief include changes in appetite and weight, fatigue,
insomnia and other sleep disturbances, loss of interest
in sex, low energy levels, nausea and vomiting, chest or
throat pain, and headache. People who have lost a
loved one in traumatic circumstances may have such
symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder as an exaggerated startle response, visual or auditory hallucinations, or high levels of muscular tension.
Doctors and other counselors have identified four
stages or phases in uncomplicated bereavement:
517

number of situations, however, which can affect or
prolong the grief process:

Bereavement

taking on the loved one’s roles and responsibilities
as well as redefining their own identities.

KEY TERMS
Bibliotherapy—The use of books (usually self-help
or problem-solving works) to improve one’s understanding of personal problems and/or to heal painful feelings.
Biofield healing—A general term for a group of
alternative therapies based on the belief that the
human body is surrounded by an energy field (or
aura) that reflects the condition of the person’s
body and spirit. Rebalancing or repairing the
energy field is thought to bring about healing in
mind and body. Reiki, therapeutic touch, polarity
balancing, Shen therapy, and certain forms of color
therapy are considered forms of biofield healing.
Complicated grief—An abnormal response to
bereavement that includes unrelieved yearning for
the dead person, the complete loss of previous
positive beliefs or worldviews, and a general inability to function.
Disenfranchised grief—Grief that cannot be
openly expressed because the death or other loss
cannot be publicly acknowledged.
Euthanasia—The act of putting a person or animal
to death painlessly or allowing them to die by withholding medical services, usually because of a
painful and incurable disease.
Mourning—The public expression of bereavement;
it may include funerals and other rituals, special
clothing, and symbolic gestures.
Regression—A return to earlier, particularly infantile, patterns of thought and behavior.
Thanatology—The medical, psychological, or
legal study of death and dying.
Traumatic grief—Grief resulting from the loss of a
loved one in a traumatic situation (natural or transportation disaster, act of terrorism or mass murder, etc.)



Shock, disbelief, feelings of numbness. This initial
phase lasts about two weeks, during which the
bereaved person finally accepts the reality of the
loved one’s death.



Suffering the pain of grief. This phase typically lasts
for several months. Some people undergo a mild
temporary depression about six months after the
loved one’s death.



Adjusting to life without the loved one. In this phase
of bereavement, survivors may find themselves

518



Moving forward with life, forming new relationships, and having positive expectations of the future.
Most people reach this stage within one to two years
after the loved one’s death.

BEREAVEMENT IN CHILDREN. Children do not
experience bereavement in the same way as adolescents
and adults. Preschool children usually do not understand death as final and irreversible, and may talk or act
as if the dead pet or family member will wake up or
come back. Children between the ages of five and nine
are better able to understand the finality of death, but
they tend to assume it will not affect them or their
family. They are likely to be shocked and severely
upset by a death in their immediate family. In addition
to the physical disturbances that bereaved adults often
experience, children sometimes begin to act like infants
again (wanting bottle feeding, using baby talk, etc.)
This pattern of returning to behaviors characteristic of
an earlier life stage is called regression.
TRAUMATIC AND COMPLICATED GRIEF. Since the
early 1990s, thanatologists (doctors and other counselors who specialize in issues related to death and
dying) have identified two types of grief that do not
resolve normally with the passage of time. Traumatic
grief is defined as grief resulting from a sudden traumatic event that involves violent suffering, mutilation,
and/or multiple deaths; appears to be random or preventable; and often involves the survivor’s own brush
with death. The symptoms of traumatic grief are similar to those of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Such events as the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001, the East Asian tsunami of December 2004, and
airplane crashes or other transportation disasters may
produce traumatic grief in survivors.

In contrast to traumatic grief, complicated grief
does not necessarily result from a specific type of event
but rather refers to an abnormally intense and prolonged response to bereavement. While most people
are able to move through a period of bereavement and
recover a sense of purpose and meaning in life, people
with complicated grief feel as if their entire worldview
has been shattered. They cannot stop thinking of the
dead person, long to be with him or her, and may feel
that part of them died along with the loved one. They
sometimes start acting like the deceased person,
mimicking the symptoms of his or her illness, behaving in reckless ways, talking about ‘‘joining’’ the loved
one, or refusing to accept the reality of the death.
In general they are unable to function normally.
Complicated grief should not be regarded as simply
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

may take three years or longer to resolve, even with
appropriate treatment.

Prevention
Diagnosis
Bereavement is considered a normal response to a
death or other loss. A doctor who suspects that a
patient is suffering from traumatic or complicated
grief, however, may use various psychological inventories or questionnaires to see whether the patient
meets the criteria for PTSD, major depression, or
acute stress disorder. In addition, there are several specific questionnaires to help diagnose complicated grief.

Treatment
Most people do not require formal treatment
for bereavement. In the early 2000s, however, many
people choose to participate in support groups for
recently bereaved people or hospice follow-up programs
for relatives of patients who died in that hospice.
Bereavement support groups are particularly helpful in
guiding members through such common but painful
problems as disposing of the dead person’s possessions,
celebrating holidays without the loved one, coping with
anniversaries, etc.
Traumatic grief is usually treated in the same way
as post-traumatic stress, with temporary use of medications to control sleep disturbances and anxiety
symptoms along with long-term psychotherapy.
Those suffering from traumatic grief may also be
referred to support groups of people dealing with the
same type of sudden and violent loss. Some of these
organizations are listed below. Complicated grief is
usually managed with a combination of group and
individual psychotherapy.

Alternative treatment
Alternative therapies that have been reported to
help with the sleep disturbances and other physical
symptoms of bereavement include prayer and meditation; such movement therapies as yoga and tai chi;
therapeutic touch, Reiki, and other forms of biofield
healing; bibliotherapy and journaling; music therapy,
art therapy, hydrotherapy, and massage therapy.

Prognosis
Most people move through the stages of the normal grief process within several months to two years,
depending on the length and closeness of the relationship. Traumatic grief and complicated grief, however,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Bereavement is considered a normal response to
death and loss, which are universal human experiences. It should ordinarily be allowed to run its course;
most counselors maintain that trying to stifle or cut
short the grief process is more likely to cause emotional problems later on than to prevent them.

I Beriberi
Definition
Beriberi is a disease caused by a deficiency of
thiamine (vitamin B1) that affects many systems of
the body, including the muscles, heart, nerves, and
digestive system. Beriberi literally means ‘‘I can’t, I
can’t’’ in Singhalese, which reflects the crippling effect
it has on its victims. It is common in parts of southeast
Asia, where white rice is the main food. In the United
States, beriberi is primarily seen in people with chronic
alcoholism.

Description
Beriberi puzzled medical experts for years as it
ravaged people of all ages in Asia. Doctors thought it
was caused by something in food. Not until the early
1900s did scientists discover that rice bran, the outer
covering that was removed to create the polished white
rice preferred by Asians, actually contained something
that prevented the disease. Thiamine was the first
vitamin identified. In the 1920s, extracts of rice polishings were used to treat the disease.
In adults, there are different forms of beriberi,
classified according to the body systems most affected.
Dry beriberi involves the nervous system; wet beriberi
affects the heart and circulation. Both types usually
occur in the same patient, with one set of symptoms
predominating.
A less common form of cardiovascular, or wet
beriberi, is known as ‘‘shoshin.’’ This condition
involves a rapid appearance of symptoms and acute
heart failure. It is highly fatal and is known to cause
sudden death in young migrant laborers in Asia whose
diet consists of white rice.
Cerebral beriberi, also known as WernickeKorsakoff syndrome, usually occurs in chronic alcoholics and affects the central nervous system (brain
and spinal cord). It can be caused by a situation that
aggravates a chronic thiamine deficiency, like an alcoholic binge or severe vomiting.
Infantile beriberi is seen in breastfed infants of
thiamine-deficient mothers, who live in developing
nations.
Although severe beriberi is uncommon in the
United States, less severe thiamine deficiencies do
occur. About 25% of all alcoholics admitted to a
hospital in the United States show some evidence of
thiamine deficiency.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

B vitamins—This family of vitamins consists of
thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxine (B6), biotin, folic acid (B9),
and cobalamin (B12). They are interdependent and
involved in converting glucose to energy.
Coenzyme—A substance needed by enzymes to
produce many of the reactions in energy and protein metabolism in the body.
Edema—An excess accumulation of fluid in the
cells and tissues.

The following systems are most affected by
beriberi:


Gastrointestinal system. When the cells of the
smooth muscles in the digestive system and glands
do not get enough energy from glucose, they are
unable to produce more glucose from the normal
digestion of food. There is a loss of appetite, indigestion, severe constipation, and a lack of hydrochloric
acid in the stomach.



Nervous System. Glucose is essential for the central
nervous system to function normally. Early deficiency symptoms are fatigue, irritability, and poor
memory. If the deficiency continues, there is damage
to the peripheral nerves that causes loss of sensation
and muscle weakness, which is called peripheral neuropathy. The legs are most affected. The toes feel
numb and the feet have a burning sensation; the leg
muscles become sore and the calf muscles cramp. The
individual walks unsteadily and has difficulty getting
up from a squatting position. Eventually, the muscles
shrink (atrophy) and there is a loss of reflexes in the
knees and feet; the feet may hang limp (footdrop).



Cardiovascular system. There is a rapid heartbeat
and sweating. Eventually the heart muscle weakens.
Because the smooth muscle in the blood vessels is
affected, the arteries and veins relax, causing swelling, known as edema, in the legs.



Musculoskeletal system. There is widespread muscle pain caused by the lack of TPP in the muscle
tissue.

Enzyme—A protein that acts as a catalyst to produce chemical changes in other substances without
being changed themselves.
Metabolism—All the physical and chemical
changes that take place within an organism.
Peripheral neuropathy—A disease affecting the
portion of the nervous system outside the brain
and spinal chord. One or more nerves can be
involved, causing sensory loss, muscle weakness
and shrinkage, and decreased reflexes.
Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)—The coenzyme
containing thiamine that is essential in converting
glucose to energy.

Causes and symptoms
Thiamine is one of the B vitamins and plays an
important role in energy metabolism and tissue building. It combines with phosphate to form the coenzyme
thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is essential in
reactions that produce energy from glucose or that
convert glucose to fat for storage in the tissues.
When there is not enough thiamine in the diet, these
basic energy functions are disturbed, leading to problems throughout the body.
Special situations, such as an over-active metabolism, prolonged fever, pregnancy, and breastfeeding, can increase the body’s thiamine requirements
and lead to symptoms of deficiency. Extended periods of diarrhea or chronic liver disease can result in
the body’s inability to maintain normal levels of
many nutrients, including thiamine. Other persons
at risk are patients with kidney failure on dialysis
and those with severe digestive problems who are
unable to absorb nutrients. Alcoholics are susceptible
because they may substitute alcohol for food and
their frequent intake of alcohol decreases the body’s
ability to absorb thiamine.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Infants who are breastfed by a thiaminedeficient mother usually develop symptoms of
deficiency between the second and fourth month of
life. They are pale, restless, unable to sleep, prone
to diarrhea, and have muscle wasting and edema in
their arms and legs. They have a characteristic,
sometimes silent, cry and develop heart failure and
nerve damage.

Diagnosis
A physical examination will reveal many of the
early symptoms of beriberi, such as fatigue, irritation, nausea, constipation, and poor memory, but
the deficiency may be difficult to identify.
Information about the individual’s diet and general
health is also needed.
There are many biochemical tests based on thiamine metabolism or the functions of TPP that can
detect a thiamine deficiency. Levels of thiamine can
be measured in the blood and urine and will be
reduced if there is a deficiency. The urine can be

KEY TERMS

Beriberi

collected for 24 hours to measure the level of thiamine excreted. Another reliable test measures the
effect of TPP on red blood cell activity since all
forms of beriberi affect the metabolism of red blood
cells.
An electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures
electrical activity in the brain, may be done to rule out
other causes of neurologic changes. Observing
improvements in the patient after giving thiamine
supplements will also confirm the diagnosis.

Treatment
Treatment with thiamine reverses the deficiency in
the body and relieves most of the symptoms. Severe
thiamine deficiency is treated with high doses of thiamine given by injection into a muscle (intramuscular)
or in a solution that goes into a vein (intravenously)
for several days. Then smaller doses can be given
either by injection or in pill form until the patient
recovers. Usually there are other deficiencies in the
B vitamins that will also need treatment.
The cardiovascular symptoms of wet beriberi can
respond to treatment within a few hours if they are
not too severe. Heart failure may require additional
treatment with diuretics that help eliminate excess
fluid and with heart-strengthening drugs like
digitalis.
Recovery from peripheral neuropathy and other
symptoms of dry beriberi may take longer and patients
frequently become discouraged. They should stay
active; physical therapy will also help in recovery.
Infantile beriberi is treated by giving thiamine to
both the infant and the breast feeding mother until
levels are normal.
In Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, thiamine should
be given intravenously or by injection at first because the
intestinal absorption of thiamine is probably impaired
and the patient is very ill. Most of the symptoms will be
relieved by treatment, though there may be residual
memory loss.
Excess thiamine is excreted by the body in the
urine, and negative reactions to too much thiamine
are rare. Thiamine is unstable in alkali solutions, so it
should not be taken with antacids or barbiturates.

Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for beriberi deal first with
correcting the thiamine deficiency. As in conventional
treatments, alternative treatments for beriberi stress
a diet rich in foods that provide thiamine and other
522

B vitamins, such as brown rice, whole grains, raw
fruits and vegetables, legumes, seeds, nuts, and yogurt.
Drinking more than one glass of liquid with a meal
should be avoided, since this may wash out the vitamins before they can be absorbed by the body.
Thiamine should be taken daily, with the dose depending on the severity of the disease. Additional supplements of B vitamins, a multivitamin and mineral
complex, and Vitamin C are also recommended.
Other alternative therapies may help relieve the person’s symptoms after the thiamine deficiency is
corrected.

Prognosis
Beriberi is fatal if not treated and the longer the
deficiency exists, the sicker the person becomes. Most
of the symptoms can be reversed and full recovery is
possible when thiamine levels are returned to normal
and maintained with a balanced diet and vitamin supplements as needed.

Prevention
A balanced diet containing all essential nutrients
will prevent a thiamine deficiency and the development of beriberi. People who consume large quantities
of junk food like soda, pretzels, chips, candy, and high
carbohydrate foods made with unenriched flours may
be deficient in thiamine and other vital nutrients. They
may need to take vitamin supplements and should
improve their diets.
Dietary Requirements
The body’s requirements for thiamine are tied
to carbohydrate metabolism and expressed in terms
of total intake of calories. The current recommended dietary allowances (RDA) are 0.5 mg for
every 1000 calories, with a minimum daily intake
of 1 mg even for those who eat fewer than 2,000
calories in a day. The RDA for children and teenagers is the same as for adults: 1.4 mg daily for
males over age eleven, and 1.1 mg for females.
During pregnancy, an increase to 1.5 mg daily is
needed. Because of increased energy needs and the
secretion of thiamine in breast milk, breast feeding
mothers need 1.5 mg every day. In infants, 0.4 mg
is advised.
Food Sources
The best food sources of thiamine are lean
pork, beef, liver, brewer’s yeast, peas and beans,

I Berylliosis
Definition
Berylliosis is lung inflammation caused by inhaling dust or fumes that contain the metallic element
beryllium. Found in rocks, coal, soil, and volcanic
dust, beryllium is used in the aerospace industry and
in many types of manufacturing. Berylliosis occurs in
both acute and chronic forms. In some cases, appearance of the disease may be delayed as much as 20 years
after exposure to beryllium.

Description
In the 1930s, scientists discovered that beryllium
could make fluorescent light bulbs last longer. During
the following decade, the hard, grayish metal was
identified as the cause of a potentially debilitating,
sometimes deadly disease characterized by shortness
of breath and inflammation, swelling, and scarring of
the lungs.
The manufacture of fluorescent light bulbs is no
longer a source of beryllium exposure, but serious
health hazards are associated with any work
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Beryllium dust and fumes are classified as toxic air
pollutants by the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA). It is estimated that 2–6% of workers exposed
to these contaminants eventually develop berylliosis.

Causes and symptoms
Coughing, shortness of breath, and weight loss
that begin abruptly can be a symptom of acute berylliosis. This condition is caused by beryllium air pollution that inflames the lungs making them rigid; it can
affect the eyes and skin as well. People who have acute
berylliosis are usually very ill. Most recover, but some
die of the disease.
Chronic berylliosis is an allergic reaction to longterm exposure to even low levels of beryllium dust or
fumes. A systemic disease that causes formation of
abnormal lung tissue and enlargement of the lymph
nodes, chronic berylliosis also may affect other parts
of the body. The symptoms of chronic berylliosis are

food products are enriched with thiamine, along
with riboflavin, niacin, and iron, to prevent dietary
deficiency.

largely the same as those seen in acute berylliosis, but
they develop more slowly.

Diagnosis
Berylliosis is initially suspected if a patient with
symptoms of the disease has a history of beryllium
exposure. A chest x ray shows characteristic changes
in the lungs. However, since these changes can resemble those caused by other lung diseases, further testing
may be necessary.
The beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test
(BeLPT), a blood test that can detect beryllium sensitivity (i.e. an allergic reaction to beryllium), is used to
screen individuals at risk of developing berylliosis.
When screening results reveal a high level of sensitivity, BeLPT is performed on cells washed from the
lungs. This test is now considered the most definitive
diagnostic test for berylliosis.

Treatment
Individuals with beryllium sensitivity or earlystage berylliosis should be transferred from tasks
that involve beryllium exposure and regularly examined to determine whether the disease has progressed.
Acute berylliosis is a serious disease that occasionally may be fatal. Ventilators can help patients with
acute berylliosis breathe. Prompt corticosteroid therapy is required to lessen lung inflammation.
Chronic beryllium disease is incurable.
Corticosteroid therapy is often prescribed, but it is
not certain that steroids can alter the progression of
the disease, and they have no effect on scarring of lung
tissue. Cleansing the lungs of beryllium is a slow process, so long-term therapy may be required. Chelation
therapy is currently under investigation as a treatment
for the disease.

Prognosis
Most patients with acute berylliosis recover fully
7–10 days after treatment begins, and the disease
usually causes no after effects.
Patients whose lungs are severely damaged by
chronic berylliosis may experience fatal heart failure
because of the strain placed on the heart.

Prevention
Eliminating exposure to beryllium is the surest way
to prevent berylliosis. Screening workers who are
exposed to beryllium fumes or dust or who develop an

I Beta blockers
Definition
Beta blockers are medicines that affect the body’s
response to certain nerve impulses. This, in turn,
decreases the force and rate of the heart’s contractions, which lowers blood pressure and reduces the
heart’s demand for oxygen.

Purpose
The main use of beta blockers is to treat high
blood pressure. Some also are used to relieve the type
of chest pain called angina or to prevent heart attacks
in people who already have had one heart attack.
These drugs may also be prescribed for other conditions, such as migraine, tremors, and irregular heartbeat. In eye drop form, they are used to treat certain
kinds of glaucoma.

Description
Beta blockers, also known as beta-adrenergic
blockers, are available only with a physician’s
prescription. They come in capsule, tablet, liquid, and
injectable forms. Some common beta blockers are
atenolol (Tenormin), metoprolol (Lopressor), nadolol
(Corgard), propranolol (Inderal), and timolol
(Blocadren). Timolol and certain other beta blockers
are also sold in eye drop form for treating glaucoma.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Angina pectoris—A feeling of tightness, heaviness,
or pain in the chest, caused by a lack of oxygen in
the muscular wall of the heart.
Glaucoma—A condition in which pressure in the
eye is abnormally high. If not treated, glaucoma
may lead to blindness.
Migraine—A throbbing headache that usually
affects only one side of the head. Nausea, vomiting,
increased sensitivity to light, and other symptoms
often accompany migraine.

Eye drops that contain beta blockers include betaxolol
(Betoptic), cartelol (Ocupress), and timolol (Timoptic).

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type,
strength, and form of beta blocker and the condition
for which it is prescribed. The physician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription can recommend the correct dosage.
This medicine may take several weeks to noticeably lower blood pressure. Taking it exactly as directed is important.
This medicine should not be stopped without
checking with the physician who prescribed it. Some
conditions may get worse when patients stop taking
beta blockers abruptly. This may also increase the risk
of heart attack in some people. Because of these possible effects, it is important to keep enough medicine on
hand to get through weekends, holidays, and vacations.
Physicians may recommend that patients check
their pulse before and after taking this medicine. If the
pulse becomes too slow, circulation problems may result.

Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking beta
blockers is important. The physician will check to
make sure the medicine is working as it should and
will watch for unwanted side effects. People who have
high blood pressure often feel perfectly fine. However,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

they should continue to see their physicians even when
they feel well so that the physician can keep a close
watch on their condition. Patients also need to keep
taking their medicine even when they feel fine.
Beta blockers will not cure high blood pressure,
but will help control the condition. To avoid the serious health problems that high blood pressure can
cause, patients may have to take medicine for the rest
of their lives. Furthermore, medicine alone may not be
enough. Patients with high blood pressure may also
need to avoid certain foods and keep their weight
under control. The health care professional who is
treating the condition can offer advice on what measures may be necessary. Patients being treated for high
blood pressure should not change their diets without
consulting their physicians.
Anyone taking beta blockers for high blood pressure should not take any other prescription or over-thecounter medicine without first checking with his or her
physician. Some medicines may increase blood pressure.
Anyone who is taking beta blockers should be
sure to tell the health care professional in charge
before having any surgical or dental procedures or
receiving emergency treatment.
Some beta blockers may change the results of
certain medical tests. Before having medical tests, anyone taking this medicine should alert the health care
professional in charge.
Some people feel drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded
when taking beta blockers. Anyone who takes these
drugs should not drive, use machines or do anything
else that might be dangerous until they have found out
how the drugs affect them.
Beta blockers may increase sensitivity to cold,
especially in older people or people who have poor
circulation. Anyone who takes this medicine should

not to be exposed to the cold for too long.

take beta blockers and who want to breastfeed their
babies should check with their physicians.

People who usually have chest pain when they
exercise or exert themselves may not have the pain
when they are taking beta blockers. This could lead
them to be more active than they should be. Anyone
taking this medicine should ask his or her physician
how much exercise and activity is safe.

OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Beta blockers may
increase breathing problems or make allergic reactions
more severe in people who have allergies, bronchitis, or
emphysema. However, while breathing diseases were
once thought to outrule use of beta blockers, new
research in 2004 shows that this may have been a
large misconception. A clinical trial showed that
more than 98% of patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease safely used beta blockers. It is
advised for patients with emphysema and other serious pulmonary disease to check with a physician and
discuss the new findings.

Older people may be unusually sensitive to the
effects of beta blockers. This may increase the chance
of side effects.
Physicians may advise people taking beta blockers
to wear or carry medical identification indicating that
they are taking this medicine.
Special conditions
People who have certain medical conditions or
who are taking certain other medicines may have problems if they take beta blockers. Before taking these
drugs, the physician should know about any of these
conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reac-

tions to beta blockers in the past should let his or her
physician know before taking the drugs again. The
physician should also be told about any allergies to
insect stings, medicines, foods, dyes, preservatives, or
other substances. In people with allergies to medicines,
foods, or insect stings, beta blockers may make the
allergic reactions more severe and harder to treat.
Anyone who has an allergic reaction while taking
beta blockers should get medical attention right
away and should make sure the physician in charge
knows that he or she is taking this medicine.
Beta blockers may also cause serious reactions in
people who take allergy shots. Anyone taking this
medicine should be sure to alert the physician before
having any allergy shots.
DIABETES. Beta blockers may make blood sugar
levels rise and may hide some symptoms of low
blood sugar. Diabetic patients should discuss these
possible problems with their physicians.
PREGNANCY. Some studies of beta blockers show
that these drugs cause problems in newborns whose
mothers use them during pregnancy. Other studies do
not show such effects. Women who are pregnant or
who may become pregnant should check with their
physicians about the use of beta blockers.
BREASTFEEDING. Some beta blockers pass into
breast milk and may cause breathing problems, slow
heartbeat, and low blood pressure in nursing babies
whose mothers take the drugs. Women who need to

In people with an overactive thyroid, stopping beta
blockers suddenly may cause an increase in symptoms.
Also, taking this medicine may hide a fast heartbeat,
which is one of the symptoms of overactive thyroid.
Effects of these drugs may be greater in people
with kidney or liver disease because the medicine is
cleared from the body more slowly.
Beta blockers may also make the following medical conditions worse:


Heart or blood vessel disease



Unusually slow heartbeat (bradycardia)



Myasthenia gravis (chronic disease causing muscle
weakness and possibly paralysis)



Psoriasis (itchy, scaly, red patches of skin)



Depression (now, or in the past).

Before using beta blockers, people with any of the
medical problems listed in this section should make
sure their physicians are aware of their conditions.
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking beta blockers
with certain other drugs may affect the way the drugs
work or may increase the chance of side effects.

Side effects
The most common side effects are dizziness, drowsiness, lightheadedness, sleep problems, unusual tiredness
or weakness, and decreased sexual ability. In men, this
can occur as impotence or delayed ejaculation. These
problems usually go away as the body adjusts to the
drug and do not require medical treatment unless they
persist or they interfere with normal activities. On the
positive side, research in 2004 showed that use of beta
blockers helps reduce risk for boen fractures.
More serious side effects are possible. If any of the
following side effects occur, the physician who prescribed
the medicine should be notified as soon as possible:

Other side effects may occur. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after taking beta blockers should
get in touch with his or her physician.

Interactions
Beta blockers may interact with a number of other
medicines. When this happens, the effects of one or
both of the drugs may change or the risk of side effects
may be greater. Anyone who takes beta blockers
should let the physician know all other medicines he
or she is taking. Among the drugs that may interact
with beta blockers are:


Calcium channel blockers and other blood pressure
drugs. Using these drugs with beta blockers may
cause unwanted effects on the heart.



Insulin and diabetes medicines taken by mouth. Beta
blockers cause high blood sugar or hide the symptoms of low blood sugar.



Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO) such as phenelzine (Nardil) or tranylcypromine (Parnate), used
to treat conditions including depression and
Parkinson’s disease. Taking beta blockers at the
same time or within two weeks of taking MAO inhibitors may cause severe high blood pressure.



Airway-opening drugs (bronchodilators) such as aminophylline (Somophyllin), dyphylline (Lufyllin)
oxtriphylline
(Choledyl),
or
theophylline
(Somophyllin-T). When combined with beta blockers, the effects of both the beta blockers and the
airway-opening drugs may be lessened.



Cocaine. High blood pressure, fast heartbeat, and
heart problems are possible when cocaine and beta
blockers are combined. Also, cocaine may interfere
with the effects of beta blockers.



Allergy shots or allergy skin tests. Beta blockers may
increase the chance of serious reactions to these
medicines.

The list above may not include every drug that
interacts with beta blockers. Checking with a physician or pharmacist before combining beta blockers
with any other prescription or nonprescription (overthe-counter) medicine is advised.

I Beta -microglobulin test
2

Definition
Beta2-microglobulin is a protein found on the surface of many cells. Testing is done primarily when
evaluating a person for certain kinds of cancer affecting white blood cells including chronic lymphocytic
leukemia, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and multiple
myeloma or kidney disease.

Purpose
Beta2-microglobulin is plentiful on the surface of
white blood cells. Increased production or destruction
of these cells causes Beta2-microglobulin levels in the
blood to increase. This increase is seen in people with
cancers involving white blood cells, but it is particularly meaningful in people newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a malignancy
(cancer) of a certain kind of white blood cell, called a
plasma cell. At the time of diagnosis, the Beta2-microglobulin levels reflect how advanced the disease is and
the likely prognosis for that person.
When kidney disease is suspected, comparing
blood and urine levels helps identify where the kidney
is damaged. Beta2-microglobulin normally is filtered
out of the blood by the kidney’s glomeruli (a round
mass of capillary loops leading to each kidney tubule),
only to be partially reabsorbed back into the blood
when it reaches the kidney’s tubules. In glomerular
kidney disease, the glomeruli can’t filter it out of the
blood, so levels increase in the blood and decrease in
the urine. In tubular kidney disease, the tubules can’t
reabsorb it back into the blood, so urine levels rise and
blood levels fall. After a kidney transplant, increased
blood levels may be an early sign of rejection.

tubular, not glomerular. In a kidney transplant
patient, an increase may be a sign of rejection, toxic
amounts of antirejection medication, or a viral infection. An increased level in a worker exposed to cadmium or mercury may signal beginning kidney
damage and in a person with HIV, advancing disease.

100,000 people per year, but it is more common in
Southeast Asia. It occurs in men only slightly more
often than in women and it is most commonly diagnosed in people in their 50s and 60s. In fact, about
65% of patients with bile duct cancer are over age 65.

Causes and symptoms
A number of risk factors are associated with the
development of bile duct cancer:


Primary sclerosing cholangitis. This disease is characterized by extensive scarring of the biliary tract,
sometimes associated with inflammatory bowel
disease.



Choledochal cysts. These are abnormal dilatations of
the biliary tract that usually form during fetal development. There is evidence that these cysts may rarely
arise during adulthood.



Hepatolithiasis. This is the condition of stone formation within the liver (not including gallbladder stones).

thought to be at least partially responsible for the
higher prevalence of bile duct cancer in Southeast
Asia.

intestine (extrahepatic). It is a rare tumor with poor
outcome for most patients.

Description
Bile is a substance manufactured by the liver that
aids in the digestion of food. Bile ducts are channels
that carry the bile from the liver to the small intestine.
Like the tributaries of a river, the small bile ducts in
the liver converge into two large bile ducts called the
left and right hepatic ducts. These exit the liver and
join to form the common hepatic duct. The gallbladder, which concentrates and stores the bile, empties
into the common hepatic duct to form the common
bile duct. Finally, this large duct connects to the small
intestine where the bile can help digest food.
Collectively, this network of bile ducts is called the
biliary tract.
Bile duct cancer originates from the cells that line
the inner surface of the bile ducts. A tumor may arise
anywhere along the biliary tract, either within or outside of the liver. Bile duct tumors are typically slowgrowing tumors that spread by local invasion of neighboring structures and by way of lymphatic channels.
Bile duct cancer is an uncommon malignancy. In
the United States, approximately one case arises per
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Symptoms
Jaundice is the first symptom in 90% of patients.
This occurs when the bile duct tumor causes an
obstruction in the normal flow of bile from the liver
to the small intestine. Bilirubin, a component of bile,
builds up within the liver and is absorbed into the
bloodstream in excess amounts. This can be detected
in a blood test, but it can also manifest as yellowish
discoloring of the skin and eyes. The bilirubin in the
bloodstream also makes the urine appear dark.
Additionally, the patient may experience generalized
itching due to the deposition of bile components in the
skin. Normally, a portion of the bile is excreted in
stool; bile actually gives stool its brown color. But
when the biliary tract is obstructed by tumor, the
stools may appear pale.
Abdominal pain, fatigue, weight loss, and poor
appetite are less common symptoms. Occasionally, if
obstruction of the biliary tract causes the gallbladder
to swell enormously yet without causing pain, the
physician may be able to feel the gallbladder during a
529

Bile duct cancer

KEY TERMS

Bile duct cancer

physical examination. Sometimes the biliary tract can
become infected, but this is normally a rare consequence of invasive tests. Infection causes fever, chills,
and pain in the right upper portion of the abdomen.

Diagnosis
Certain laboratory tests of the blood may aid in
the diagnosis. The most important one is the test for
elevated bilirubin levels in the bloodstream. Levels of
alkaline phosphatase and CA 19-9 may also be
elevated.
When symptoms, physical signs, and blood tests
point toward an abnormality of the biliary tract, the
next step involves radiographic exams. Ultrasound,
computed tomography (CT scan), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are noninvasive and rapid. In
recent years, MRI has become the favored imaging
choice for initial diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma
when the exam is available and affordable or covered
by insurance. These tests can often detect the actual
tumor as well as dilatation of the obstructed biliary
tract. If these tests indicate the presence of a tumor,
cholangiography is required. This procedure involves
injecting dye into the biliary tract to obtain anatomic
images of the bile ducts and the tumor. The specialist
that performs this test can also insert small tubes, or
stents, into a partially obstructed portion of the bile
duct to prevent further obstruction by growth of the
tumor. This is vitally important since it may be the
only intervention that is possible in certain patients.
Cholangiography is an invasive test that carries a
small risk of infection of the biliary tract. The objective
of these radiological tests is to determine the size and
location of the tumor, as well as the extent of spread to
nearby structures.
The treatment of bile duct tumors is usually not
affected by the specific type of cancer cells that comprise the tumor. For this reason, some physicians
forego biopsy of the tumor.

Treatment
The treatment is with surgical resection (removal)
of the tumor and all involved structures. Unfortunately,
sometimes the cancer has already spread too far when
the diagnosis is made. Thus, in the treatment of bile
duct cancer, the first question to answer is if the tumor
may be safely resected by surgery with reasonable
benefit to the patient. If the cancer involves
certain blood vessels or has spread widely throughout
the liver, resection may not be possible. Sometimes
further invasive testing is required.
530

Angiography can determine if the blood vessels are
involved. Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that
allows the surgeon to directly assess the tumor and
nearby lymph nodes without making a large incision
in the abdomen. Only about 45% of bile duct cancers
are ultimately resectable.
If the tumor is resectable, and the patient is
healthy enough to tolerate the operation, the specific
type of surgery performed depends on the location of
the tumor. For tumors within the liver or high up in
the biliary tract, resection of part of the liver may be
required. Tumors in the middle portion of the biliary
tract can be removed alone. Tumors of the lower end
of the biliary tract may require extensive resection of
part of the pancreas, small intestine, and stomach to
ensure complete resection.
Unfortunately, sometimes the cancer appears
resectable by all the radiological and invasive tests,
but is found to be unresectable during surgery. In
this scenario, a bypass operation can relieve the biliary
tract obstruction, but does not remove the tumor
itself. This does not produce a cure but it can offer a
better quality of life for the patient.

Prognosis
Prognosis depends on the stage and resectability
of the tumor. If the patient cannot undergo surgical
resection, the survival rate is commonly less than one
year. If the tumor is resected, the survival rate
improves, with 20% of these patients surviving past
five years.
Clinical trials
Studies of new treatments in patients are known as
clinical trials. These trials seek to compare the standard method of care with a new method, or the trials
may be trying to establish whether one treatment is
more beneficial for certain patients than others.
Sometimes, a new treatment that is not being offered
on a wide scale may be available to patients participating in clinical trials, but participating in the trials may
involve some risk. To learn more about clinical trials,
patients can call the National Cancer Institute (NCI)
at 1-800-4-CANCER or visit the NCI web site for
patients at <http://www.cancertrials.nci.nih.gov>.

Prevention
Other than the avoidance of infections caused by
liver flukes, there are no known preventions for this
cancer.

Bilharziasis see Schistosomiasis

I Biliary atresia
Definition
Biliary atresia is the failure of a fetus to develop an
adequate pathway for bile to drain from the liver to the
intestine.

rivers, until they all pour into a single duct that empties
into the duodenum (first part of the small intestine).
Between the liver and the duodenum this duct has a side
channel connected to the gall bladder. The gall bladder
stores bile and concentrates it, removing much of its
water content. Then, when a meal hits the stomach, the
gall bladder contracts and empties its contents.
Bile is a mixture of waste chemicals that the liver
removes from the circulation and excretes through the
biliary system into the intestine. On its way out, bile
assists in the digestion of certain nutrients. If bile
cannot get out because the channels are absent or
blocked, it backs up into the liver and eventually into
the rest of the body. The major pigment in bile is a
chemical called bilirubin, which is yellow. Bilirubin is a
breakdown product of hemoglobin (the red chemical
in blood that carries oxygen). If the body accumulates
an excess of bilirubin, it turns yellow (jaundiced). Bile
also turns the stool brown. Without it, stools are the
color of clay.

Causes and symptoms
It is possible that a viral infection is responsible
for this disease, but evidence is not yet convincing. The
cause remains unknown.
The affected infant will appear normal at birth
and during the newborn period. After two weeks the
normal jaundice of the newborn will not disappear,
and the stools will probably be clay-colored. At this
point, the condition will come to the attention of a
physician. If not, the child’s abdomen will begin to
swell, and the infant will get progressively more ill.
Nearly all untreated children will die of liver failure
within two years.

Diagnosis
The persistence of jaundice beyond the second
week in a newborn with clay-colored stools is a sure
sign of obstruction to the flow of bile. An immediate
evaluation that includes blood tests and imaging of the
biliary system will confirm the diagnosis.

Description
Biliary atresia is the most common lethal liver
disease in children, occurring once every 10,000–
15,000 live births. Half of all liver transplants are
done for this reason.
The normal anatomy of the bile system begins
within the liver, where thousands of tiny bile ducts
collect bile from liver cells. These ducts merge into
larger and larger channels, like streams flowing into
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment
Surgery is the only treatment. Somehow the surgeon must create an adequate pathway for bile to
escape the liver into the intestine. The altered anatomy
of the biliary system is different in every case, calling
upon the surgeon’s skill and experience to select and
execute the most effective among several options. If
the obstruction is only between the gall bladder and

Biliary atresia is a congenital condition in which the pathway for bile to drain from the liver to the intestine is undeveloped. It is

KEY TERMS
Duodenum—The first part of the small intestine,
beginning at the outlet of the stomach.
Hemoglobin—The red, iron-containing chemical
in the blood that carries oxygen to the tissues.
Jaundice—The yellow color taken on by a patient

the intestine, it is possible to attach a piece of intestine
directly to the gall bladder. More likely, the upper
biliary system will also be inadequate, and the surgeon
will attach a piece of intestine directly to the liver–the
Kasai procedure. In its wisdom, the body will discover
that the tiny bile ducts in that part of the liver are
discharging their bile directly into the intestine. Bile
532

will begin to flow in that direction, and the channels
will gradually enlarge. Survival rates for the Kasai
procedure are commonly 50% at five years and 15%
at 10 years. Persistent disease in the liver gradually
destroys the organ.

Prognosis
Before liver transplants became available, even
prompt and effective surgery did not cure the whole
problem. Biliary drainage can usually be established,
but the patients still have a defective biliary system
that develops progressive disease and commonly leads
to an early death. Transplantation now achieves up to
90% one-year survival rates and promises to prevent
the chronic disease that used to accompany earlier
procedures.

Prevention
The specific cause of this birth defect is unknown,
so all that women can do is to practice the many
general preventive measures, even before they
conceive.

I Binge-eating disorder
Definition
Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by a
loss of control over eating behaviors. The binge eater
consumes unnaturally large amounts of food in a short
time period, but unlike a bulimic, does not regularly
engage in any inappropriate weight-reducing behaviors (for example, excessive exercise, vomiting, taking
laxatives) following the binge episodes.

Description
BED typically strikes individuals sometime between
adolescence and the early twenties. Because of the nature of the disorder, most BED patients are overweight
or obese. Studies of weight loss programs have shown
that an average of 30% of individuals enrolling in these
programs report binge eating behavior.

KEY TERMS
Bulimia—An eating disorder characterized by
binge eating and inappropriate compensatory
behavior, such as vomiting, misusing laxatives, or
excessive exercise.
Cognitive behavioral therapy—A therapy that pays
particular attention to a patient’s behavior and
thinking processes rather than underlying psychological causes of an activity.

importance of food, for example, as a source of comfort in times of emotional distress. As children, BED
patients may have been taught to clean their plate
regardless of their appetite, or that finishing a meal
made them a ‘‘good’’ girl or boy. Cultural attitudes
towards beauty and thinness may also be a factor in
the BED equation.
During binge episodes, BED patients experience a
definite sense of lost control over their eating. They eat
quickly and to the point of discomfort even if they
aren’t hungry. They typically binge alone two or more
times a week, and often feel depressed and guilty once
the episode has concluded.

Diagnosis
Binge eating disorder is usually diagnosed and
treated by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist. In
addition to an interview with the patient, personality
and behavioral inventories, such as the Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), may be
administered as part of the assessment process. One
of several clinical inventories, or scales, may also be
used to assess depressive symptoms, including the
Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) or Beck
Depression Inventory (BDI). These tests may be administered in an outpatient or hospital setting.

Causes and symptoms
Binge eating episodes may act as a psychological
release for excessive emotional stress. Other circumstances that may predispose an individual to BED
include heredity and affective disorders, such as
major depression. BED patients are also more likely
to have a comorbid, or co-existing, diagnosis of impulsive behaviors (for example, compulsive buying), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, or
personality disorders.
Individuals who develop BED often come from
families who put an unnatural emphasis on the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment
Many BED individuals binge after long intervals
of excessive dietary restraint; therapy helps normalize
this pattern. The initial goal of BED treatment is
to teach the patient to gain control over his eating
behavior by focusing on eating regular meals and
avoiding snacking. Cognitive-behavioral therapy,
group therapy, or interpersonal psychotherapy may
be employed to uncover the emotional motives, distorted thinking, and behavioral patterns behind the
binge eating.
533

Binge-eating disorder

Biliary atresia is a congenital condition in which
the pathway for bile to drain from the liver to the
intestine is undeveloped. It is the most common lethal
liver disease in children.

Biofeedback

Because the prevalence of depression in BED
patients is high, psychopharmacological treatment
with antidepressants may also be prescribed. Once
the binge eating behavior is curbed and depressive
symptoms are controlled, the physical symptoms
of BED can be addressed. The overweight BED
patient may be placed on a moderate exercise program and a nutritionist may be consulted to educate
the patient on healthy food choices and strategies for
weight loss.

Prognosis
The poor dietary habits and obesity that are symptomatic of BED can lead to serious health problems,
such as high blood pressure, heart attacks, and diabetes, if left unchecked. BED is a chronic condition
that requires ongoing medical and psychological management. To bring long-term relief to the BED patient,
it is critical to address the underlying psychological
causes behind binge eating behaviors. It appears that
up to 50% of BED patients will stop bingeing with
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

I Biofeedback
Definition
Biofeedback, or applied psychophysiological
feedback, is a patient-guided treatment that teaches
an individual to control muscle tension, pain, body
temperature, brain waves, and other bodily functions
and processes through relaxation, visualization, and
other cognitive control techniques. The name

biofeedback refers to the biological signals that are
fed back, or returned, to the patient in order for the
patient to develop techniques of manipulating them.

Purpose
Biofeedback has been used to successfully treat a
number of disorders and their symptoms, including
temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), chronic
pain, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Raynaud’s
syndrome, epilepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), migraine headaches, anxiety,
depression, traumatic brain injury, and sleep disorders.
Illnesses that may be triggered at least in part by
stress are also targeted by biofeedback therapy. Certain
types of headaches, high blood pressure, bruxism (teeth
grinding), post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, substance abuse, and some anxiety disorders may
be treated successfully by teaching patients the ability
to relax and release both muscle and mental tension.
Biofeedback is often just one part of a comprehensive
treatment program for some of these disorders.
NASA has used biofeedback techniques to treat
astronauts who suffer from severe space sickness, during which the autonomic nervous system is disrupted.
Scientists at the University of Tennessee have adapted
these techniques to treat individuals suffering from
severe nausea and vomiting that is also rooted in
autonomic nervous system dysfunction.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Autonomic nervous system—The part of the nervous system that controls so-called involuntary
functions, such as heart rate, salivary gland secretion, respiratory function, and pupil dilation.
Bruxism—Habitual, often unconscious, grinding of
the teeth.
Epilepsy—A neurological disorder characterized
by the sudden onset of seizures.
Placebo effect—Placebo effect occurs when a treatment or medication with no known therapeutic
value (a placebo) is administered to a patient, and
the patient’s symptoms improve. The patient
believes and expects that the treatment is going to
work, so it does. The placebo effect is also a factor to
some degree in clinically-effective therapies, and
explains why patients respond better than others to
treatment despite similar symptoms and illnesses.
Raynaud’s syndrome—A vascular, or circulatory
system, disorder which is characterized by abnormally cold hands and feet. This chilling effect is
caused by constriction of the blood vessels in the
extremities, and occurs when the hands and feet
are exposed to cold weather. Emotional stress can
also trigger the cold symptoms.
Schizophrenia—Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder that causes distortions in perception (delusions and hallucinations), inappropriate moods
and behaviors, and disorganized or incoherent
speech and behavior.
Temporomandibular joint disorder—Inflammation,
irritation, and pain of the jaw caused by improper
opening and closing of the temporomandibular
joint. Other symptoms include clicking of the jaw
and a limited range of motion.

Recent research also indicates that biofeedback may
be a useful tool in helping patients with urinary incontinence regain bladder control. Individuals learning pelvic-floor muscle strengthening exercises can gain better
control over these muscles by using biofeedback. Sensors
are placed on the muscles to train the patient where they
are and when proper contractions are taking place.

Description
Origins
In 1961, Neal Miller, an experimental psychologist, suggested that autonomic nervous system
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

responses (for instance, heart rate, blood pressure,
gastrointestinal activity, regional blood flow) could
be under voluntary control. As a result of his experiments, he showed that such autonomic processes were
controllable. This work led to the creation of biofeedback therapy. Willer’s work was expanded by other
researchers. Thereafter, research performed in the
1970s by UCLA researcher Dr. Barry Sterman established that both cats and monkeys could be trained to
control their brain wave patterns. Sterman then used
his research techniques on human patients with epilepsy, where he was able to reduce seizures by 60%
with the use of biofeedback techniques. Throughout
the 1970s, other researchers published reports of their
use of biofeedback in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, headaches, Raynaud’s syndrome, and excess
stomach acid, and as a tool for teaching deep relaxation. Since the early work of Miller and Sterman,
biofeedback has developed into a front-line behavioral
treatment for an even wider range of disorders and
symptoms.
During biofeedback, special sensors are placed on
the body. These sensors measure the bodily function
that is causing the patient problem symptoms, such as
heart rate, blood pressure, muscle tension (EMG or
electromyographic feedback), brain waves (EEC or electroencophalographic feedback), respiration, and body
temperature (thermal feedback), and translates the
information into a visual and/or audible readout, such
as a paper tracing, a light display, or a series of beeps.
While the patient views the instantaneous feedback from the biofeedback monitors, he or she begins
to recognize what thoughts, fears, and mental images
influence his or her physical reactions. By monitoring this relationship between mind and body, the
patient can then use these same thoughts and mental
images as subtle cues, as these act as reminders to
become deeply relaxed, instead of anxious. These
reminders also work to manipulate heart beat, brain
wave patterns, body temperature, and other bodily
functions. This is achieved through relaxation exercises, mental imagery, and other cognitive therapy
techniques.
As the biofeedback response takes place, patients
can actually see or hear the results of their efforts
instantly through the sensor readout on the biofeedback equipment. Once these techniques are learned
and the patient is able to recognize the state of relaxation or visualization necessary to alleviate symptoms,
the biofeedback equipment itself is no longer needed.
The patient then has a powerful, portable, and selfadministered treatment tool to deal with problem
symptoms.

Biofeedback

KEY TERMS

Biofeedback

Biofeedback that specializes in reading and altering brain waves is sometimes called neurofeedback.
The brain produces four distinct types of brain
waves—delta, theta, alpha, and beta—that all operate
at a different frequency. Delta, the slowest frequency
wave, is the brain wave pattern associated with sleep.
Beta waves, which occur in a normal, waking state,
can range from 12-35 Hz. Problems begin to develop
when beta wave averages fall in the low end (underarousal) or the high end (overarousal) of that spectrum. Underarousal might be present in conditions
such as depression or attention-deficit disorder, and
overarousal may be indicative of an anxiety disorder,
obsessive compulsive disorder, or excessive stress.
Beta wave neurofeedback focuses on normalizing
that beta wave pattern to an optimum value of around
14 Hz. A second type of neurofeedback, alpha-theta,
focuses on developing the more relaxing alpha (8-13
Hz) and theta waves (4-9 Hz) that are usually associated with deep, meditative states, and has been used
with some success in substance abuse treatment.
Through brain wave manipulation, neurofeedback
can be useful in treating a variety of disorders that are
suspected or proven to impact brain wave patterns,
such as epilepsy, attention-deficit disorder, migraine
headaches, anxiety, depression, traumatic brain injury,
and sleep disorders. The equipment used for neurofeedback usually uses a monitor as an output device. The
monitor displays specific patterns that the patient
attempts to change by producing the appropriate type
of brain wave. Or, the monitor may reward the patient
for producing the appropriate brain wave by producing
a positive reinforcer, or reward. For example, children
may be rewarded with a series of successful moves in a
displayed video game.
Depending on the type of biofeedback, individuals
may need up to 30 sessions with a trained professional to
learn the techniques required to control their symptoms
on a long-term basis. Therapists usually recommend
that their patients practice both biofeedback and relaxation techniques on their own at home.

Preparations
Before initiating biofeedback treatment, the
therapist and patient will have an initial consultation
to record the patients medical history and treatment
background and discuss goals for therapy.
Before a neurofeedback session, an EEG is taken
from the patient to determine his or her baseline brainwave pattern.
Biofeedback typically is performed in a quiet and
relaxed atmosphere with comfortable seating for the
536

patient. Depending on the type and goals of biofeedback being performed, one or more sensors will be
attached to the patient’s body with conductive gel
and/or adhesives. These may include:


Electromyographic (EMG) sensors. EMG sensors
measure electrical activity in the muscles, specifically
muscle tension. In treating TMJ or bruxism, these
sensors would be placed along the muscles of the jaw.
Chronic pain might be treated by monitoring electrical energy in other muscle groups.



Galvanic skin response (GSR) sensors. These are
electrodes placed on the fingers that monitor perspiration, or sweat gland, activity. These may also
be called skin conductance level (SCL).



Temperature sensors. Temperature, or thermal, sensors measure body temperature and changes in blood
flow.



Electroencephalography (EEG) sensors. These electrodes are applied to the scalp to measure the electrical activity of the brain, or brain waves.



Heart rate sensors. A pulse monitor placed on the
finger tip can monitor pulse rate.



Respiratory sensors. Respiratory sensors monitor
oxygen intake and carbon dioxide output.

Precautions
Individuals who use a pacemaker or other implantable electrical devices should inform their biofeedback therapist before starting treatments, as certain
types of biofeedback sensors have the potential to
interfere with these devices.
Biofeedback may not be suitable for some
patients. Patients must be willing to take a very active
role in the treatment process. And because biofeedback focuses strictly on behavioral change, those
patients who wish to gain insight into their symptoms
by examining their past might be better served by
psychodynamic therapy.
Biofeedback may also be inappropriate for cognitively impaired individuals, such as those patients with
organic brain disease or a traumatic brain injury,
depending on their levels of functioning.
Patients with specific pain symptoms of unknown
origin should undergo a thorough medical examination before starting biofeedback treatments to rule out
any serious underlying disease. Once a diagnosis has
been made, biofeedback can be used concurrently with
conventional treatment.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Side effects
There are no known side effects to properly administered biofeedback or neurofeedback sessions.

Research and general acceptance
Preliminary research published in late 1999 indicated that neurofeedback may be a promising new tool
in the treatment of schizophrenia. Researchers
reported that schizophrenic patients had used neurofeedback to simulate brain wave patterns that antipsychotic medications produce in the brain. Further
research is needed to determine what impact this may
have on treatment for schizophrenia.
The use of biofeedback techniques to treat an array
of disorders has been extensively described in the medical literature. Controlled studies for some applications
are limited, such as for the treatment of menopausal
symptoms and premenstrual disorder (PMS). There is
also some debate over the effectiveness of biofeedback
in ADHD treatment, and the lack of controlled studies
on that application. While many therapists, counselors,
and mental health professionals have reported great
success with treating their ADHD patients with neurofeedback techniques, some critics attribute this positive
therapeutic impact to a placebo effect.
There may also be some debate among mental
health professionals as to whether biofeedback should
be considered a first line treatment for some mental
illnesses, and to what degree other treatments, such as
medication, should be employed as an adjunct therapy.

I Bipolar disorder
Definition
Bipolar, or manic-depressive disorder, is a mood
disorder that causes radical emotional changes and
mood swings, from manic highs to depressive lows.
The majority of bipolar individuals experience alternating episodes of mania and depression.

Description
In the United States alone, more than two million
people are diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Research
shows that as many as 10 million people might be
affected by bipolar disorder, which is the sixth-leading
cause of disability worldwide. The average age of
onset of bipolar disorder is from adolescence through
the early twenties. However, because of the complexity
of the disorder, a correct diagnosis can be delayed for
several years or more. In a survey of bipolar patients
conducted by the National Depressive and Manic
Depressive Association (MDMDA), one-half of
respondents reported visiting three or more professionals before receiving a correct diagnosis, and over
one-third reported a wait of ten years or more before
they were correctly diagnosed.
Bipolar I disorder is characterized by manic episodes, the ‘‘high’’ of the manic-depressive cycle. A
person with bipolar disorder experiencing mania often
has feelings of self-importance, elation, talkativeness,
increased sociability, and a desire to embark on goaloriented activities, coupled with the characteristics of
irritability, impatience, impulsiveness, hyperactivity,
537

Bipolar disorder

Biofeedback may only be one component of a
comprehensive treatment plan. For illnesses and
symptoms that are manifested from an organic disease
process, such as cancer or diabetes, biofeedback
should be an adjunct to (complementary to), and not
a replacement for, conventional medical treatment.

Bipolar disorder

KEY TERMS
Affective disorder—An emotional disorder involving abnormal highs and/or lows in mood. Now
termed mood disorder.
Anticonvulsant medication—A drug used to prevent convulsions or seizures; often prescribed in
the treatment of epilepsy. Several anticonvulsant
medications have been found effective in the treatment of bipolar disorder.
Antipsychotic medication—A drug used to treat
psychotic symptoms, such as delusions or hallucinations, in which patients are unable to distinguish
fantasy from reality.
Benzodiazpines—A group of tranquilizers having
sedative, hypnotic, antianxiety, amnestic, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant effects.
DSM-IV—Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). This
reference book, published by the American
Psychiatric Association, is the diagnostic standard
for most mental health professionals in the United
States.
ECT—Electroconvulsive therapy sometimes is used
to treat depression or mania when pharmaceutical
treatment fails.
Hypomania—A milder form of mania which is
characteristic of bipolar II disorder.
Mixed mania/mixed state—A mental state in
which symptoms of both depression and mania
occur simultaneously.
Mania—An elevated or euphoric mood or irritable
state that is characteristic of bipolar I disorder.
Neurotransmitter—A chemical in the brain that
transmits messages between neurons, or nerve
cells. Changes in the levels of certain neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and
dopamine, are thought to be related to bipolar
disorder.
Psychomotor retardation—Slowed mental and
physical processes characteristic of a bipolar
depressive episode.

and a decreased need for sleep. Usually this manic
period is followed by a period of depression, although
a few bipolar I individuals may not experience a major
depressive episode. Mixed states, where both manic or
hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms occur
at the same time, also occur frequently with bipolar I
538

patients (for example, depression with the racing
thoughts of mania). Also, dysphoric mania is common
(mania characterized by anger and irritability).
Bipolar II disorder is characterized by major
depressive episodes alternating with episodes of hypomania, a milder form of mania. Bipolar depression
may be difficult to distinguish from a unipolar major
depressive episode. Patients with bipolar depression
tend to have extremely low energy, retarded mental
and physical processes, and more profound fatigue
(for example, hypersomnia; a sleep disorder marked
by a need for excessive sleep or sleepiness when awake)
than unipolar depressives.
Cyclothymia refers to the cycling of hypomanic
episodes with depression that does not reach major
depressive proportions. One-third of patients with
cyclothymia will develop bipolar I or II disorder
later in life.
A phenomenon known as rapid cycling occurs in
up to 20% of bipolar I and II patients. In rapid cycling,
manic and depressive episodesmust alternate frequently;
at least four times in 12 months; to meet the diagnostic
definition. In some cases of ‘‘ultra-rapid cycling,’’ the
patient may bounce between manic and depressive
states several times within a 24-hour period. This condition is very hard to distinguish from mixed states.
Bipolar NOS is a category for bipolar states that
do not clearly fit into the bipolar I, II, or cyclothymia
diagnoses.

Causes and symptoms
The source of bipolar disorder has not been
clearly defined. Because two-thirds of bipolar patients
have a family history of affective or emotional disorders, researchers have searched for a genetic link to the
disorder. Several studies have uncovered a number of
possible genetic connections to the predisposition for
bipolar disorder. A 2003 study found that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder could have similar genetic
causes that arise from certain problems with genes
associated with myelin development in the central
nervous system. (Myelin is a white, fat-like substance
that forms a sort of layer or sheath around nerve
fibers.) Another possible biological cause under investigation is the presence of an excessive calcium buildup in the cells of bipolar patients. Also, dopamine and
other neurochemical transmitters appear to be implicated in bipolar disorder and these are under intense
investigation.
Over one-half of patients diagnosed with bipolar
disorder have a history of substance abuse. There is a
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

For some bipolar patients, manic and depressive
episodes coincide with seasonal changes. Depressive
episodes are typical during winter and fall, and
manic episodes are more probable in the spring and
summer months.
Symptoms of bipolar depressive episodes include
low energy levels, feelings of despair, difficulty concentrating, extreme fatigue, and psychomotor retardation (slowed mental and physical capabilities). Manic
episodes are characterized by feelings of euphoria,
lack of inhibitions, racing thoughts, diminished need
for sleep, talkativeness, risk taking, and irritability. In
extreme cases, mania can induce hallucinations and
other psychotic symptoms such as grandiose illusions.

Diagnosis
Bipolar disorder usually is diagnosed and treated
by a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist with medical
assistance. In addition to an interview, several clinical
inventories or scales may be used to assess the patient’s
mental status and determine the presence of bipolar
symptoms. These include the Millon Clinical
Multiaxial Inventory III (MCMI-III), Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory II (MMPI-2), the
Internal State Scale (ISS), the Self-Report Manic
Inventory (SRMI), and the Young Mania Rating
Scale (YMRS). The tests are verbal and/or written
and are administered in both hospital and outpatient
settings.
Psychologists and psychiatrists typically use the
criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV ) as
a guideline for diagnosis of bipolar disorder and
other mental illnesses. DSM-IV describes a manic
episode as an abnormally elevated or irritable mood
lasting a period of at least one week that is distinguished
by at least three of the mania symptoms: inflated selfesteem, decreased need for sleep, talkativeness, racing
thoughts, distractibility, increase in goal-directed activity, or excessive involvement in pleasurable activities
that have a high potential for painful consequences. If
the mood of the patient is irritable and not elevated,
four of the symptoms are required.
Although many clinicians find the criteria too
rigid, a hypomanic diagnosis requires a duration
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

of at least four days with at least three of the symptoms
indicated for manic episodes (four if mood is irritable
and not elevated). DSM-IV notes that unlike manic
episodes, hypomanic episodes do not cause a marked
impairment in social or occupational functioning, do
not require hospitalization, and do not have psychotic
features. In addition, because hypomanic episodes are
characterized by high energy and goal directed activities and often result in a positive outcome, or are
perceived in a positive manner by the patient, bipolar
II disorder can go undiagnosed.
Bipolar symptoms often present differently in
children and adolescents. Manic episodes in these age
groups are typically characterized by more psychotic
features than in adults, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of schizophrenia. Children and adolescents also
tend toward irritability and aggressiveness instead of
elation. Further, symptoms tend to be chronic, or
ongoing, rather than acute, or episodic. Bipolar children are easily distracted, impulsive, and hyperactive,
which can lead to a misdiagnosis of attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Furthermore, their
aggression often leads to violence, which may be misdiagnosed as a conduct disorder.
Substance abuse, thyroid disease, and use of
prescription or over-the-counter medication can mask
or mimic the presence of bipolar disorder. In cases of
substance abuse, the patient must ordinarily undergo a
period of detoxification and abstinence before a mood
disorder is diagnosed and treatment begins.

Treatment
Treatment of bipolar disorder is usually achieved
with medication. A combination of mood stabilizing
agents with antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants is used to regulate manic and depressive
episodes.
Mood stabilizing agents such as lithium, carbamazepine, and valproate are prescribed to regulate the
manic highs and lows of bipolar disorder:


Lithium (Cibalith-S, Eskalith, Lithane, Lithobid,
Lithonate, Lithotabs) is one of the oldest and most
frequently prescribed drugs available for the treatment of bipolar mania and depression. Because the
drug takes four to ten days to reach a therapeutic
level in the bloodstream, it sometimes is prescribed in
conjunction with neuroleptics and/or benzodiazepines to provide more immediate relief of a manic
episode. Lithium also has been shown to be effective
in regulating bipolar depression, but is not recommended for mixed mania. Lithium may not be an

of abusers meeting the criteria for bipolar disorder. The

correspond to the manic depression of the bipolar
patient, making the disorder difficult to diagnosis.

effective long-term treatment option for rapid cyclers,
who typically develop a tolerance for it, or may not
respond to it. Possible side effects of the drug include
weight gain, thirst, nausea, and hand tremors.
Prolonged lithium use also may cause hyperthyroidism (a disease of the thryoid that is marked by heart
palpitations, nervousness, the presence of goiter,
sweating, and a wide array of other symptoms.)




Carbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol) is an anticonvulsant drug usually prescribed in conjunction with
other mood stabilizing agents. The drug often is
used to treat bipolar patients who have not
responded well to lithium therapy. Blurred vision
and abnormal eye movement are two possible side
effects of carbamazepine therapy.

system. Patients taking MAOIs must cut foods high
in tyramine (found in aged cheeses and meats) out of
their diet to avoid hypotensive side effects.


Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is a heterocyclic antidepressant. The exact neurochemical mechanism of the
drug is not known, but it has been effective in regulating bipolar depression in some patients. Side
effects of bupropion include agitation, anxiety, confusion, tremor, dry mouth, fast or irregular heartbeat,
headache, and insomnia.



ECT, or electroconvulsive therapy, has a high success
rate for treating both unipolar and bipolar depression, and mania. However, because of the convenience of drug treatment and the stigma sometimes
attached to ECT therapy, ECT usually is employed
after all pharmaceutical treatment options have been
explored. ECT is given under anesthesia and patients
are given a muscle relaxant medication to prevent
convulsions. The treatment consists of a series of
electrical pulses that move into the brain through
electrodes on the patient’s head. Although the exact
mechanisms behind the success of ECT therapy are
not known, it is believed that this electrical current
alters the electrochemical processes of the brain, consequently relieving depression. Headaches, muscle
soreness, nausea, and confusion are possible side
effects immediately following an ECT procedure.
Temporary memory loss has also been reported in
ECT patients. In bipolar patients, ECT is often used
in conjunction with drug therapy.

Valproate (divalproex sodium, or Depakote; valproic
acid, or Depakene) is one of the few drugs available
that has been proven effective in treating rapid cycling
bipolar and mixed states patients. Valproate is prescribed alone or in combination with carbamazepine
and/or lithium. Stomach cramps, indigestion, diarrhea, hair loss, appetite loss, nausea, and unusual
weight loss or gain are some of the common side
effects of valproate. Note: valproate also is approved
for the treatment of mania. A 2003 study found that
the risk of death from suicide is about two and onehalf times higher in people with bipolar disorder
taking divalproex than those taking lithium.

Treating the depression associated with bipolar
disorder has proven more challenging. In early 2004,
the first drug to treat bipolar administration was
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). It is called Symbyax, a combination of olanzipine and fluoxetine, the active ingredient in Prozac.
Because antidepressants may stimulate manic
episodes in some bipolar patients, their use typically
is short-term. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs) or, less often, monoamine oxidase inhibitors
(MAO inhibitors) are prescribed for episodes of bipolar depression. Tricyclic antidepressants used to treat
unipolar depression may trigger rapid cycling in bipolar patients and are, therefore, not a preferred treatment option for bipolar depression.


SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline
(Zoloft), and paroxetine (Paxil), regulate depression
by regulating levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter.
Anxiety, diarrhea, drowsiness, headache, sweating,
nausea, sexual problems, and insomnia are all possible side effects of SSRIs.



MAOIs such as tranylcypromine (Parnate) and phenelzine (Nardil) block the action of monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme in the central nervous

540

Adjunct treatments are used in conjunction with
a long-term pharmaceutical treatment plan:


Long-acting benzodiazepines such as clonazepam
(Klonapin) and alprazolam (Xanax) are used for
rapid treatment of manic symptoms to calm and
sedate patients until mania or hypomania have
waned and mood stabilizing agents can take effect.
Sedation is a common effect, and clumsiness, lightheadedness, and slurred speech are other possible
side effects of benzodiazepines.



Neuroleptics such as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) and
haloperidol (Haldol) also are used to control mania
while a mood stabilizer such as lithium or valproate
takes effect. Because neuroleptic side effects can be
severe (difficulty in speaking or swallowing, paralysis
of the eyes, loss of balance control, muscle spasms,
severe restlessness, stiffness of arms and legs, tremors
in fingers and hands, twisting movements of body,
and weakness of arms and legs), benzodiazepines are
generally preferred over neuroleptics.

Clozapine (Clozaril) is an atypical antipsychotic
medication used to control manic episodes in patients
who have not responded to typical mood stabilizing
agents. The drug has also been a useful prophylactic,
or preventative treatment, in some bipolar patients.
Common side effects of clozapine include tachycardia
(rapid heart rate), hypotension, constipation, and
weight gain. Agranulocytosis, a potentially serious but
reversible condition in which the white blood cells that
typically fight infection in the body are destroyed, is a
possible side effect of clozapine. Patients treated with
the drug should undergo weekly blood tests to monitor
white blood cell counts.
Risperidone (Risperdal) is an atypical antipsychotic medication that has been successful in controlling
mania when low doses were administered. In early
2004, the FDA approved its use for treating bipolar
mania. The side effects of risperidone are mild compared to many other antipsychotics (constipation,
coughing, diarrhea, dry mouth, headache, heartburn,
increased length of sleep and dream activity, nausea,
runny nose, sore throat, fatigue, and weight gain).
Olanzapine (Zyprexa) is another atypical antipsychotic approved in 2003 for use in combination with
lithium or valproate for treatment of acute manic
episodes associated with bipolar disorder. Side effects
include hypotension (low blood pressure) associated
with dizziness, rapid heartbeat, and syncope, or low
blood pressure to the point of fainting.
Lamotrigine (Lamictal, or LTG), an anticonvulsant medication, was found to alleviate manic symptoms in a 1997 trial of 75 bipolar patients. The drug
was used in conjunction with divalproex (divalproate)
and/or lithium. Possible side effects of lamotrigine
include skin rash, dizziness, drowsiness, headache,
nausea, and vomiting.

plenty of rest, regular exercise, and proper diet.
Chinese herbs may soften mood swings. Biofeedback
is effective in helping some patients control symptoms
such as irritability, poor self control, racing thoughts,
and sleep problems. A diet low in vanadium (a mineral
found in meats and other foods) and high in vitamin C
may be helpful in reducing depression.
A surprising study in 2004 found that a rarely used
combination of magnetic fields used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning improved the moods of
subjects with bipolar disorder. The discovery was
made while scientists were using MRI to investigate
effectiveness of certain medications. However, they
found that a particular type of echo-planar magnetic
field led to reports of mood improvement. Further
studies may one day lead to a smaller, more convenient use of magnetic treatment.

Prognosis
While most patients will show some positive
response to treatment, response varies widely, from
full recovery to a complete lack of response to all
drug and/or ECT therapy. Drug therapies frequently
need adjustment to achieve the maximum benefit for
the patient. Bipolar disorder is a chronic recurrent
illness in over 90% of those afflicted, and one that
requires lifelong observation and treatment after diagnosis. Patients with untreated or inadequately treated
bipolar disorder have a suicide rate of 15-25% and a
nine-year decrease in life expectancy. With proper
treatment, the life expectancy of the bipolar patient
will increase by nearly seven years and work productivity increases by ten years.

Prevention
The ongoing medical management of bipolar disorder is critical to preventing relapse, or recurrence, of
manic episodes. Even in carefully controlled treatment
programs, bipolar patients may experience recurring
episodes of the disorder. Patient education in the form
of psychotherapy or self-help groups is crucial for
training bipolar patients to recognize signs of mania
and depression and to take an active part in their
treatment program.

pheasants, quail, and guinea fowl. The avian influenza
viruses generally do not infect humans.
Avian viruses are carried around the world by
migratory birds. Wild ducks are natural reservoirs of
the infection, according to the World Health
Organization (WHO). Those wild birds generally
don’t become ill, but avian flu is extremely contagious
and has caused some domesticated birds to become
very ill and die. The casualties included chickens, turkeys, and ducks.
Virus suptypes
Reaction to the infection varies among the species
because flu viruses are constantly mutating into new
strains or subgroups. Low-pathogenic viruses cause
few or no symptoms in infected birds. However,
some strains can mutate into highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) strains that are extremely infectious
and deadly to birds.
The viruses are identified by a series of letters and
numbers that refer to two proteins, hemagglutinin
(HA) and neuraminidase (NA). There are 16 HA subtypes and nine NA subtypes of influenza A virus.
Numerous combinations of the two proteins are
possible, and each combination forms a new subtype.
There are 15 different Influenza A subtypes that
can infect birds, according to the United States
Centers for Disease Control (CDC). In comparison,
there are three known subtypes of human flu virus A:
H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. Avian viruses can infect
pigs, but people are generally not affected. That changed when there was an outbreak of H5N1 in Hong
Kong in 1997.
Deadly outbreaks

I Bird flu
Definition
Bird flu is an infectious disease caused by strains
of the Type A influenza viruses that ordinarily only
infect birds. Avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infected
and caused the deaths of people.

Description
Bird flu, which is also known as avian influenza,
was first identified in Italy more than 100 years ago.
Avian viruses occur naturally in birds, and can infect
birds including chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys,
542

The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus was first isolated
in terns in South Africa in 1961, and then in Hong Kong
in 1997. Hong Kong’s avian flu outbreak coincided
with 18 cases of severe respiratory disease in people.
Those diagnosed with bird flu had close contact with
poultry. Six people died, according to WHO. There
was ‘‘limited transmission’’ of the virus to health care
workers, but they did not become seriously ill.
Medical research showed that the avian virus had
jumped from birds to people. Within three days, Hong
Kong’s poultry population of about 1.5 million birds
was destroyed to prevent further infection. There was
another H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong in February
of 2003. It affected two members of a family that had
recently visited China. One person died, according to
the WHO.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

In Hong Kong, the avian virus subtype H9N2
caused mild cases of flu in two children in 1999 and
one child in the middle of December of 2003, according to WHO. While H9N2 was not highly pathogenic
in birds, there was an outbreak of H5N1 in Korea in
mid-December of 2003. The next month, there was an
outbreak in Vietnam that was followed by outbreaks
in other Asian countries.
Human bird flu cases
The World Health Organization tracks bird flu outbreaks and the charts the numbers of human cases that
have been confirmed by a laboratory. There were 74
cases and 49 deaths between January of 2004 and March
31, 2005. The flu caused two deaths in Cambodia. In
Thailand, 12 of 17 people with bird flu died. In Vietnam,
the flu was fatal in 35 of 55 diagnosed cases. Deaths
related to the H5N1 viruses have been caused by pneumonia and pulmonary complications.
Moreover, the Democratic People’s Republic of
Korea (North Korea) officially reported the country’s
first outbreak of avian influenza in poultry on March 27,
2005. Outbreaks occurred at chicken farms, and there
were no human cases at that time, according to WHO.
In October 2005, an outbreak of bird flu was
reported at a farm near the Mongolian capital of
Hohhot in the People’s Republic of China. The H5N1
strain of the virus was detected in a parrot located in
Britain. The parrot contracted the disease while in quarantine with birds originating in Taiwan. In January 2006,
the H5N1 strain was confirmed as the cause of death in at
least two cases in Dogubeyazit, Turkey. This case, as well
as others documented in countries across Europe, indicate the potential for the disease to spread worldwide.
Preparing for a pandemic

the new virus strain. Historically, pandemics occur
three to four times during a century when new virus
subtypes appear. After World War I, the great influenza pandemic of 1917-1918 caused from 40 to 50
million deaths globally, according to WHO. The flu
pandemic of 1968-1969 claimed 1 to 4 million lives.
According to a 2004 WHO report, medical influenza experts agree that another flu pandemic is ‘‘inevitable and possibly imminent.’’ In a December 8, 2004
report, WHO warned that the ‘‘best case scenario’’
projection for next pandemic was that the new flu strain
would kill from 2 to 7 million people. Moreover, ‘‘tens
of millions’’ of people would require medical attention.
The appearance of H5N1 signals that the world is
moving closer to a pandemic, WHO reported.
The spread of H5N1 to humans increased the
likelihood of a new strain emerging that could be
transmitted by people. That could create a pandemic.
Nations and the World Health Organization are
working to prevent a pandemic or cause it to be less
deadly. Their strategies include efforts to decrease the
spread of flu strains in poultry and the development of
vaccines to treat the virus in people.

Causes and symptoms
Avian flu is caused by an influenza virus that birds
carry in their intestines. The virus spreads as infected
birds excrete saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Birds
vulnerable to the flu become infected when they come
into contact with the excretions or surfaces contaminated by the infected matter.
Birds that survive the H5N1 infection can
excrete the virus for at least 10 days, according to a
WHO report. The strain had proliferated through
bird-to-bird contact to flocks on farms and poultry
in live bird markets. The virus can also spread in
surfaces including manure, bird feed, equipment,
vehicles, egg flats, and crates, and the clothing and
shoes of people who came into contact with the
virus.

The World Health Organization and nations
including the United States are troubled about the
deadly consequences that could occur if H5N1 mutated
into a new virus subtype that could be transferred from
one human to another. That subtype would develop if
the avian virus acquired human influenza genes,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA). A strain of bird flu spread by human-tohuman contact could cause an influenza pandemic.

A small amount of a highly pathogenic avian
influenza virus could be deadly. One gram (0.035
ounces) of contaminated manure could hold enough
virus to infect 1 million birds, according to the USDA.
From 1997 through the spring of 2005, the viruses
primarily infected people in Asia who had contact
with infected birds and surfaces.

A pandemic is a worldwide epidemic that is dangerous because people have little or no immunity to

outbreak. People experienced traditional flu symptoms
such as a fever, cough, sore throat, and aching muscles.
Other symptoms included eye infections (conjunctivitis), pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, viral pneumonia, and other severe and life-threatening
complications.
Avian flu symptoms in birds
The sudden death of a bird that had not appeared
ill is one symptom of the highly pathogenic bird flu.
According to the USDA, infected live birds may display one or more of the following symptoms: lack
of energy, appetite loss, nasal discharge, coughing,
sneezing, a lack of coordination, and diarrhea. In
addition, the bird may lay fewer eggs or produce eggs
that are soft-shelled or misshapen. Furthermore, there
may be swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, and wattles. Another symptom is purple discoloration on the
combs, wattles, and legs.
If there is an outbreak of the highly pathogenic
flu in birds, they are destroyed to prevent the spread of
the virus.
Virus mixing vessels
Influenza viruses undergo frequent changes and
form new subtypes. In addition, influenza A viruses
can trade genetic materials with the viruses of other
species. Two different strains trade or merge material,
a process known as an antigenic shift. That shift produces a new subtype that is different from the two
parent viruses. When the new subtype contains genes
from the human virus, a pandemic resulted because
there was no immunity to the virus and no vaccine to
protect against it.
The genetic shift occurs in a ‘‘mixing vessel’’ that
was susceptible to both types of flu. In the past, the
shift was thought to be related to people living close to
pigs and domestic poultry. Pigs can be infected by
avian viruses and mammalian viruses like the human
strains, according to WHO. However, research into
the H5N1 strain indicates that people can serve as the
mixing vessels. As more people become infected with
bird flu, the probability increases that humans would
serve as the mixing vessel for a new subtype that could
be transmitted from one person to another.

Diagnosis
The symptoms of avian flu and human flu are very
similar, so laboratory testing is needed to diagnose
avian influenza. In addition to diagnosing the individual, testing in 2005 was performed to determine
544

whether the infection was spreading from birds to
people or from humans to humans.
Diagnostic tests for human flu are rapid and reliable, according to WHO. The international organization noted that laboratories within WHO’s global
network have high-security facilities and experienced
staff. Test methods include a viral culture that analyses a blood sample and swabbings of the nose or
throat. Other testing examines respiratory secretions.
In the United States, the Centers for Disease
Control is among the organizations preparing for a
possible outbreak of bird flu in humans. In addition to
specifics related to diagnosing bird flu, CDC refers
healthcare workers to precautions to prevent the
spread of flu and other respiratory infections in medical settings.
Precautionary measures include directing people
to observe cough etiquette. People with symptoms of
respiratory infection should cover their mouths or use
facial tissues when coughing or sneezing. After coughing or sneezing, the person should wash their hands
with a non-antimicrobial soap and water, alcoholbased hand rub, or antiseptic handwash.
Furthermore, people with flu-like symptoms may
be given masks to wear while they are waiting to be
examined by medical personnel. The healthcare workers should wear masks in some circumstances.
Undoubtedly, they will wear masks when working
with people with symptoms of bird flu.

Treatment
As of March of 2005, there was no vaccine to
protect people from the H5N1 virus, according to the
CDC. However, the U.S. agency and the World
Health Organization had isolated seed strains of the
virus in order to make a vaccine. Safety tests were
scheduled to start in April of 2005 on a vaccine manufactured by Sanofi pasteur, a firm in Swiftwater,
Pennsylvania, formerly known as Aventis Pasteur.
On March 23, 2005, the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) announced
that fast-track recruitment had started for volunteers
to participate in an investigative study of the vaccine.
During the Phase I trial, the trial vaccine will be tested
on 450 healthy adults between the ages of 18 to 64,
according to NIAID, which is part of the National
Institutes of Health.
Studies were to be conducted at University of
California at Los Angeles, University of Maryland
School of Medicine in Baltimore, and the University
of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Furthermore, research was underway on a vaccine
to fight H9N2, another avian flu virus subtype.
Treatment with existing drugs
Existing anti-viral medications may sometimes be
effective against avian flu viruses, according to a
March 18, 2005, report from CDC. In the United
States, four drugs have been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment and prevention of influenza A viruses.
The medications amantadine (Symmetrel),
rimantadine (Flumadine), seltamivir (Tamiflu), and
zanamivir (Relenza) were clinically effective in the
treatment of influenza A viruses in otherwise healthy
adults.
However, avian flu research indicated that the
H5N1 virus was resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, according to CCDC. The other two drugs would
‘‘probably work,’’ according to CDC. However, studies were needed of the medication’s effectiveness.
During the 2004 human flu season in the United
States, the Associated Press reported that Relenza cost
about $55 for the typical 10-day treatment. Tamiflu
cost approximately $66 for the same course of treatment. Insurance frequently covered part of the prescription costs.
For people diagnosed with bird flu, the World
Health Organization recommends that patients take
Tamiflu twice daily for five days. Treatment should
begin as soon as possible. Patients may also receive
medication to lower fevers and antibiotics to fight
secondary infections.
In the spring of 2005, there was no H5N1 vaccine.
Countries including the United States were reportedly
stockpiling Tamiflu in the event a pandemic erupted.
At that time, WHO and CDC recommended the issuing of anti-viral medication as a preventive measure to
people working in poultry production. Those people,
along with health care workers, would have priority
for the medications.

Alternative treatment
In March of 2005, people in South Korea began
eating more kimchi to ward off avian flu infection,
according to the reports from the British Broadcasting
Company and other news organizations. The public
turned to the spicy vegetable dish after scientists at
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Seoul National University announced that kimchi
aided in the recovery of 11 out of 13 infected chickens.
The scientists fed the birds an extract of kimchi, a dish
made by fermenting cabbage with red peppers,
radishes, and large amounts of garlic and ginger. A
week later, all but two birds showed signs of recovery.
The researchers acknowledged that their study
was unscientific. At that time, they were not sure
how or why kimchi was related to the recovery.
However, the announcement led people to again
regard kimchi as a health remedy. In 2003, interest in
kimchi increased when people thought eating it helped
prevent SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome).
No scientific confirmation was made between kimchi
and SARS prevention.

Prognosis
Bird flu has been fatal to people, and there was
concern in 2005 about the virus mutating into a strain
that could be transmitted by people. Health organizations and government agencies focused on preventing or reducing the risks of a pandemic caused
by bird flu.
In the United States, research was underway on
vaccines to fight the flu. Other efforts include the
USDA Safety’s guidelines for people working with
poultry. Strategies included trade restrictions on poultry and poultry products from Asia, according to the
USDA. Imported live birds and eggs were quarantined
for 30 days. During that time, they were tested for bird
flu and exotic Newcastle disease. The United States
bans the import of poultry meat from Asia because
meat processing plants were not approved by the
USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service.

Prevention
In the spring of 2005, bird flu was primarily a risk
for people in the United States who worked with
poultry. Potentially vulnerable people included those
working with poultry on farms and avian health workers like veterinarians. People working with birds in
locations such as commercial poultry facilities, veterinary offices, and live bird markets should wear protective clothing. That equipment includes boots,
coveralls, face masks, gloves, and headgear, according
to the USDA. If necessary, they should receive antiviral medications as a safeguard.
Furthermore, poultry producers should implement security measures to prevent the outbreak of a
highly pathogenic virus. Those actions include keeping flocks away from wild or migratory birds and

providing clothing and disinfectant facilities for
employees. Plastic crates should be used at live bird
markets because they were easier to clean than wood
crates. Cleaning and disinfecting areas were also
important for preventing an outbreak.
If necessary birds would be quarantined or
destroyed.

abnormalities. More than 3,000 have been identified.

Birth defects are found in 2-3% of all newborn
infants. This rate doubles in the first year, and reaches
10% by age five, as more defects become evident and
can be diagnosed. Almost 20% of deaths in newborns
are caused by birth defects.
Abnormalities can occur in any major organ or
part of the body. Major defects are structural abnormalities that affect the way a person looks and require
medical and/or surgical treatment. Minor defects are
abnormalities that do not cause serious health or social
problems. When multiple birth defects occur together
and have a similar cause, they are called syndromes. If
two or more defects tend to appear together but do not
share the same cause, they are called associations.

Causes and symptoms
The specific cause of many congenital abnormalities is unknown, but several factors associated with
pregnancy and delivery can increase the risk of birth
defects.

Teratogens
Any substance that can cause abnormal development of the egg in the mother’s womb is called a
teratogen. In the first two months after conception,
the developing organism is called an embryo; developmental stages from two months to birth are called
fetal. Growth is rapid, and each body organ has a
critical period in which it is especially sensitive to outside influences. About 7% of all congenital defects are
caused by exposure to teratogens.
DRUGS. Only a few drugs are known to cause birth
defects, but all have the potential to cause harm.
For example, in 2003, a study found that use of topical
(local) corticosteroids in the first trimester of pregnancy
may be associated with cleft lip. Thalidomide is known
to cause defects of the arms and legs; several other
types also cause problems.


Alcohol. Drinking large amounts of alcohol while
pregnant causes a cluster of defects called fetal alcohol syndrome, which includes mental retardation,

Antibiotics. Certain antibiotics are known tetratogens. Tetracycline affects bone growth and discolors
the teeth. Drugs used to treat tuberculosis can lead to
hearing problems and damage to a nerve in the head
(cranial damage).

Antineoplastic agents. Drugs given to treat cancer
can cause major congenital malformations, especially central nervous system defects. They also may
be harmful to the health care worker who is giving
them while pregnant.



Anticonvulsants. Drugs given to prevent seizures can
cause serious problems in the developing fetus,
including mental retardation and slow growth.
Studies in the United Kingdom and Australia have
tracked the percentage of birth defects caused by
certain antiepileptic drugs.

Hormones. Male hormones may cause masculinization of a female fetus. A synthetic estrogen (DES)
given in the 1940s and 1950s caused an increased risk
of cancer in the adult female children of the mothers
who received the drug.



Recreational drugs. Drugs such as LSD have been
associated with arm and leg abnormalities and central nervous system problems in infants. Crack
cocaine also has been associated with birth defects.
Since drug abusers tend to use many drugs and have
poor nutrition and prenatal care, it is hard to determine the effects of individual drugs.

Antipsychotic and antianxiety agents. Several drugs
given for anxiety and mental illness are known to
cause specific defects.

CHEMICALS. Environmental chemicals such as
fungicides, food additives, and pollutants are suspected of causing birth defects, though this is difficult
to prove.
RADIATION. Exposure of the mother to high levels

of radiation can cause small skull size (microcephaly),
blindness, spina bifida, and cleft palate. How severe the
defect is depends on the duration and timing of the
exposure.
INFECTIONS. Three viruses are known to harm a

developing baby: rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV),
and herpes simplex. Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite
that can be contracted from undercooked meat, from
dirt, or from handling the feces of infected cats, causes
serious problems. Untreated syphilis in the mother
also is harmful.
Genetic factors
A gene is a tiny, invisible unit containing information (DNA) that guides how the body forms and functions. Each individual inherits tens of thousands of
genes from each parent, arranged on 46 chromosomes.
Genes control all aspects of the body, how it works,
and all its unique characteristics, including eye color
and body size. Genes are influenced by chemicals and
radiation, but sometimes changes in the genes are
unexplained accidents. Each child gets half of its

first three months of pregnancy.
Spina bifida—One of the more common birth
defects in which the backbone never closes.

genes from each parent. In each pair of genes one
will take precedence (dominant) over the other (recessive) in determining each trait, or characteristic. Birth
defects caused by dominant inheritance include a form
of dwarfism called achondroplasia; high cholesterol;
Huntington’s disease, a progressive nervous system
disorder; Marfan syndrome, which affects connective
tissue; some forms of glaucoma, and polydactyly (extra
fingers or toes).
If both parents carry the same recessive gene,
they have a one-in-four chance that the child will
inherit the disease. Recessive diseases are severe and
may lead to an early death. They include sickle cell
anemia, a blood disorder that affects blacks, and
Tay-Sachs disease, which causes mental retardation
in people of eastern European Jewish heritage. Two
recessive disorders that affect mostly whites are:
cystic fibrosis, a lung and digestive disorder, and
phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder. If only

Some disorders are linked to the sex-determining
chromosomes passed along by parents. Hemophilia, a
condition that prevents blood from clotting, and
Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which causes muscle
weakness, are carried on the X chromosome. Genetic
defects also can take place when the egg or sperm are
forming if the mother or father passes along some
faulty gene material. This is more common in older
mothers. The most common defect of this kind is
Down syndrome, a pattern of mental retardation and
physical abnormalities, often including heart defects,
caused by inheriting three copies of a chromosome

(protrusion of part of the intestine through the abdominal wall) than women of average weight. Women who
were overweight or classified as obese also were twice as
likely to have an infant with a heart defect or multiple
birth defects than women classified as average weight.

Diagnosis
If there is a family history of birth defects or if the
mother is over 35 years old, then screening tests can be
done during pregnancy to gain information about
the health of the baby.


Alpha-fetoprotein test. This is a simple blood test
that measures the level of a substance called alphafetoprotein that is associated with some major birth
defects. An abnormally high or low level may indicate the need for further testing.



Ultrasound. The use of sound waves to examine the
shape, function, and age of the fetus is a common
procedure. It also can detect many malformations,
such as spina bifida, limb defects, and heart and
kidney problems. In 2003, researchers in England
announced a new combination of blood tests and ultrasound to detect Down syndrome sooner and more
accurately than with the usual blood screenings done
at 20 weeks of pregnancy.



Amniocentesis. This test usually is done between the
13th and 15th weeks of pregnancy. A small sample of
amniotic fluid is withdrawn through a thin needle
inserted into the mother’s abdomen. Chromosomal
analysis can rule out Down syndrome and other
genetic conditions.



Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This test can be
done as early as the ninth week of pregnancy to
identify chromosome disorders and some genetic
conditions. A thin needle is inserted through the
abdomen or a slim tube is inserted through the
vagina that takes a tiny tissue sample for testing.

A less understood cause of birth defects results
from the interaction of genes from one or both parents
plus environmental influences. These defects are
thought to include:


Cleft lip and palate, which are malformations of the
mouth.



Clubfoot, ankle or foot deformities.



Spina bifida, an open spine caused when the tube
that forms the brain and spinal chord does not
close properly.



Water on the brain (hydrocephalus), which causes
brain damage.



Diabetes mellitus, an abnormality in sugar metabolism that appears later in life.



Heart defects.



Some forms of cancer.

A serious illness in the mother, such as an underactive thyroid, or diabetes mellitus, in which her body
cannot process sugar, also can cause birth defects in the
child. In fact, in 2003, it was shown that babies of
diabetic mothers are five times as likely to have structural heart defects as other babies. An abnormal
amount of amniotic fluid may indicate or cause birth
defects. Amniotic fluid is the liquid that surrounds and
protects the unborn child in the uterus. Too little of this
fluid can interfere with lung or limb development. Too
much amniotic fluid can accumulate if the fetus has a
disorder that interferes with swallowing. In 2003, a
study linked the mother’s weight to risk of birth defects.
Obese women were about three times more likely to
have an infant with spina bifida or omphalocele
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

If a birth defect is suspected after a baby is born,
then confirmation of the diagnosis is very important.
The patient’s medical records and medical history may
hold essential information. A careful physical examination and laboratory tests should be done. Special
diagnostic tests also can provide genetic information in some cases. In 2003, the March of Dimes, a
nonprofit organization, recommended that every baby
born in the United States receive, at minimum, screening for the same core group of birth defects including
phenylketonuria, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, congenital hypothryroidism, biotinidase deficiency, and
others. They were concerned that newborn screening
varied too much from state to state.

Birth defects

one parent passes along the genes for the disorder, the
normal gene received from the other parent will
prevent the disease, but the child will be a carrier.
Having the gene is not harmful to the carrier, but
there is the 25% chance of the genetic disease showing
up in the child of two carriers.

Birthmarks

Treatment
Treatment depends on the type of birth defect and
how serious it is. When an abnormality has been
identified before birth, delivery can be planned at a
health care facility that is prepared to offer any special
care needed. Some abnormalities can be corrected
with surgery. Experimental procedures have been
used successfully in correcting some defects, like
excessive fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), even
before the baby is born. Early reports have shown
success with fetal surgery on spina bifida patients.
By operating on these fetuses while still in the womb,
surgeons have prevented the need for shunts and
improved outcomes at birth for many newborns.
However, long-term studies still are needed. Patients
with complicated conditions usually need the help of
experienced medical and educational specialists with
an understanding of the disorder.

Prognosis
The prognosis for a disorder varies with the specific condition.

Prevention
Pregnant women should eat a nutritious diet.
Taking folic acid supplements before and during pregnancy reduces the risk of having a baby with serious
problems of the brain or spinal chord (neural tube
defects). It is important to avoid any teratogen that
can harm the developing baby, including alcohol and
drugs. When there is a family history of congenital
defects in either parent, genetic counseling and testing
can help parents plan for future children. Often, counselors can determine the risk of a genetic condition
occurring and the availability of tests for it. Talking to
a genetic counselor after a child is born with a defect
can provide parents with information about medical
management and available community resources.

I Birthmarks
Definition
Birthmarks, including angiomas and vascular
malformations, are benign (noncancerous) skin
growths composed of rapidly growing or poorly
formed blood vessels or lymph vessels. Found at
birth (congenital) or developing later in life (acquired)
anywhere on the body, they range from faint spots to
dark swellings covering wide areas.

Description
Skin angiomas, also called vascular (pertaining to
vessel) nevi (marks), are composed of blood vessels
(hemangiomas) or lymph vessels (lymphangiomas),
that lie beneath the skin’s surface. Hemangiomas,
composed of clusters of cells that line the capillaries,
the body’s smallest blood vessels, are found on the face
and neck (60%), trunk (25%), or the arms and legs
(15%). Congenital hemangiomas, 90% of which
appear at birth or within the first month of life, grow
quickly, and disappear over time. They are found in 110% of full-term infants, and 25% of premature
infants. About 65% are capillary hemangiomas
(strawberry marks), 15% are cavernous (deep) hemangiomas, and the rest are mixtures. Hemangiomas are
three times more common in girls. Usually, only one
hemangioma is found, in 20% two are found, while
fewer than 5% have three or more. Lymphangiomas
are skin bumps caused by enlarged lymph vessels anywhere on the body.

Capillaries—The smallest blood vessels, they connect the arteries and veins.
Corticosteroids—Drugs that fight inflammation.
Hemangioma—A benign skin tumor composed of

Lymph vessels—Part of the lymphatic system, these
vessels connect lymph capillaries with the lymph
nodes; they carry lymph, a thin, watery fluid resembling blood plasma and containing white blood
cells.

Lymphangioma—A benign skin tumor composed
of abnormal lymph vessels.
Nevus—A mark on the skin.

Vascular malformations are poorly formed blood
or lymph vessels that appear at birth or later in life.
One type, the salmon patch (nevus simplex), a pink
mark composed of dilated capillaries, is found on the
back of the neck (also called a stork bite) in 40% of
newborns, and on the forehead and eyelids (also called
an angel’s kiss) in 20%. Stork bites are found in 70%
of white and 60% of black newborns.
Found in fewer than 1% of newborns, port-wine
stains (nevus flammeus), are vascular malformations
composed of dilated capillaries in the upper and lower
layers of the skin of the face, neck, arms, and legs.
Often permanent, these flat pink to red marks develop
into dark purple bumpy areas in later life; 85% appear
on only one side of the body.
Acquired hemangiomas include spider angiomas
(nevus araneus), commonly known as spider veins,
and cherry angiomas (senile angiomas or Campbell
de Morgan spots). Found around the eyes, cheekbones, arms, and legs, spider angiomas are red marks
formed from dilated blood vessels. They occur during
pregnancy in 70% of white women and 10% of black
women, in alcoholics and liver disease patients, and in
50% of children. Cherry angiomas, dilated capillaries
found mainly on the trunk, appear in the 30s, and
multiply with aging.

Causes and symptoms
There are no known causes for congenital skin
angiomas; they may be related to an inherited weakness of vessel walls. Exposure to estrogen causes spider
angiomas in pregnant women or those taking oral
contraceptives. Spider angiomas tend to run in
families, and may be associated with liver disease,
sun exposure, and trauma.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Ulcer—A red, shallow sore on the skin.
Vascular malformation—A poorly formed blood or
lymph vessels.

Hemangiomas
Hemangiomas first appear as single or multiple,
white or pale pink marks, ranging from 2-20 cm (average 2-5 cm) in size. Some are symptomless while others
cause pain or bleeding, or interfere with normal functioning when they are numerous, enlarged, infected, or
ulcerated. Vision is affected by large marks on the
eyelids. Spider and cherry angiomas are unsightly
but symptomless.
Each type of hemangioma has a characteristic
appearance:


Capillary hemangiomas (strawberry marks). These
round, raised marks are bright red and bumpy like
a strawberry, and become white or gray when fading.



Cavernous hemangiomas. These slightly raised,
dome-shaped, blue or purple swellings are sometimes
associated with lymphangiomas or involve the soft
tissues, bone, or digestive tract.



Spider angiomas. These are symptomless, reddish
blue marks formed from blood-filled capillaries
radiating around a central arteriole (small artery) in
the shape of a spider web.



Cherry angiomas. These harmless, dilated capillaries
appear as tiny, bright red-to-violet colored bumps.



Lymphangiomas. These dilated lymph vessels form
light pink or yellow cysts (fluid- filled sacs) or swellings.

KEY TERMS

Birthmarks

Vascular malformations
These are faint, flat, pink stains that grow as the
child grows into larger dark red or purple marks. Some
are symptomless but others bleed if enlarged or injured.
Disfiguring port-wine stains can cause emotional and
social problems. About 5% of port-wine stains on
the forehead and eyelids increase eye pressure due to
involvement of the eye and surrounding nerves.
Abnormalities of the spinal cord, soft tissues, or bone
may be associated with severe port-wine stains.
Each type has a characteristic appearance:


Salmon patches. These symptomless, light red-topink marks usually fade with time.



Port-wine stains. These flat, pink marks progress to
raised, dark red-to-purple grape-like lumps distorting the facial features, arms, or legs.

Diagnosis
Patients are treated by pediatricians (doctors who
specialize in the care of children), dermatologists (skin
disease specialists), plastic surgeons (doctors who specialize in correcting abnormalities of the appearance),
and ophthalmologists (eye disease specialists).
Angiomas and vascular malformations are not difficult to diagnose. The doctor takes a complete medical
history and performs a physical examination including
inspection and palpation of the marks. The skin is
examined for discoloration, scarring, bleeding, infection, or ulceration. The type, location, size, number,
and severity of the marks are recorded. The doctor may
empty the mark of blood by gentle pressure. Biopsies or
specialized x rays or scans of the abnormal vessels and
their surrounding areas may be performed. Patients
with port-wine stains near the eye may require skull x
rays, computed tomography scans, and vision and
central nervous system tests. Most insurance plans
pay for diagnosis and treatment of these conditions.

Treatment
Treatment choices for skin angiomas and vascular
malformations depend on their type, location, and
severity, and whether they cause symptoms, pain, or
disfigurement.
Watchful waiting
No treatment is given, but the mark is regularly
examined. This continues until the mark disappears,
or requires treatment. This approach is particularly
appropriate for the treatment of hemangiomas,
552

which often do not require treatment, since they eventually shrink by themselves.
Drugs
CORTICOSTEROIDS. Daily doses of the antiinflammatory drugs prednisone or prednisolone are
given for up to 2 months with gradual reduction of
the dose. The marks begin to subside within 7-10 days,
but may take up to 2 months to fully disappear. If no
response is seen in 2 weeks, the drug is discontinued.
Treatment may be repeated. Side effects include growth
retardation, increased blood pressure and blood sugar,
cataracts, glandular disorders, and infection. The corticosteroids triamcinolone acetate and betamethasone
sodium phosphate or acetate are injected directly into
the marks with a response usually achieved within a
week; additional injections are given in 4-6 weeks. Side
effects include tissue damage at the injection site.
INTERFERON ALPHA-2A. This drug reduces cell
growth, and is used for vascular marks that affect
vision, and that are unresponsive to corticosteroids.
Given in daily injections under the skin, a response
rate of 50% is achieved after about 7 months. Side
effects include fever, chills, muscle and joint pain,
vision disorders, low white and red blood cell counts,
fatigue, elevated liver enzymes, nausea, blood clotting
problems, and nerve damage.
ANTIBIOTICS. Oral or topical (applied to the skin)
antibiotics are prescribed for infected marks.

Surgery
LASER SURGERY. Lasers create intense heat that
destroys abnormal blood vessels beneath the skin,
without damaging normal skin. Two types of lasers
are used: the flashlamp-pulsed dye laser (FPDL) and
the neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser. The FPDL,
used mainly for strawberry marks and port-wine
stains, penetrates to a depth of 1.8 mm and causes
little scarring, while the Nd:YAG laser penetrates to
a depth of 6 mm, and is used to treat deep hemangiomas. Laser surgery is not usually painful, but can be
uncomfortable. Anesthetic cream is used for FPDL
treatment. Treatment with the Nd:YAG laser requires
local or general anesthesia. Children are usually
sedated or anesthetized. Healing occurs within 2
weeks. Side effects include bruising, skin discoloration, swelling, crusting, and minor bleeding.
SURGICAL EXCISION. Under local or general
anesthesia, the skin is cut with a surgical instrument,
and vascular marks or their scars are removed. The cut
is repaired with stitches or skin clips.

Other treatments



Spider angiomas. These fade following childbirth and
in children, but may recur. About 90% respond to
sclerotherapy, electrodesiccation, or laser therapy.



Cherry angiomas. These are easily removed by
electrodesiccation.



Lymphangiomas. These require surgery.



Salmon patches. Eyelid marks disappear by 6-12
months of age, and forehead marks fade by age 6;
however, 50% of stork bites on the neck persist into
adulthood.



Port-wine stains. Some flat birthmarks are easily
covered with make-up. Treatment during infancy
or childhood improves results. About 95% of the
stains respond to FPDL surgery with minimal scarring;
25% will completely and 70% will partially disappear.
For unknown reasons, 5% show no improvement.

These include:




Sclerotherapy. Injection of a special solution causes
blood clotting and shrinkage with little scarring. Side
effects include stinging, swelling, bruising, scarring,
muscle cramping, and allergic reactions. This treatment is used most commonly for spider angiomas.
Embolization. Material injected into the vessel
blocks blood flow which helps control blood loss
during or reduces the size of inoperable growths. A
serious side effect, stroke, can occur if a major blood
vessel becomes blocked.



Make-up. Special brands are designed to cover birthmarks (Covermark or Dermablend).



Cleaning and compression. Bleeding marks are
cleaned with soap and water or hydrogen peroxide,
and compressed with a sterile bandage for 5-10 minutes.

Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments for strengthening weak
blood vessels include eating high-fiber foods and
those containing bioflavonoids, including citrus fruit,
blueberries, and cherries, supplementing the diet with
vitamin C, and taking the herbs, ginkgo (Ginkgo
biloba) and bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus.)

Prognosis
The various types of birthmarks have different
prognoses:




Capillary hemangiomas. Fewer than 10% require
treatment. Without treatment, 50% disappear by
age 5, 70% by age 7, and 90% by age 9. No skin
changes are found in half while others have some
discoloration, scarring, or wrinkling. From 30-90%
respond to oral corticosteroids, and 45% respond to
injected corticosteroids; 50% respond to interferon
Alpha-2a. About 60% improve after laser surgery.
Cavernous hemangiomas. Some do not disappear
and some are complicated by ulceration or infection.
About 75% respond to Nd:YAG laser surgery but
have scarring. Severe marks respond to oral corticosteroids, but some require excision.

Prevention
Congenital hemangiomas or vascular malformations cannot be prevented, but spider angiomas
may be prevented by exercise, weight control, and a
high-fiber diet, as well as avoidance of sun exposure,
alcohol drinking, or wearing tight hosiery.

Description
Mammals
DOGS. In the United States, where the dog population exceeds 50 million, dogs surpass all other mammals
in the number of bites inflicted on humans. However,
most dog-bite injuries are minor. A telephone survey of
U.S. households conducted in 1994 led researchers to
estimate that 3,737,000 dog bites not requiring medical
attention occurred in the United States that year, versus
757,000 that required medical treatment. Studies also
show that most dog bites are from pets or other dogs
known to the bitten person, that males are more likely
than females to be bitten, and that children face a greater
risk than adults. Each year, about 10-20 Americans,
mostly children under 10 years of age, are killed by dogs.

Dog bites result in an estimated 340,000 emergency
room visits annually throughout the United States.
More than half of the bites seen by emergency departments occur at home. Children under 10 years old,
especially boys between 5 and 9 years of age, are more
likely than older people to visit an emergency room for
bite treatment. Children under 10 years old were also
much more liable to be bitten on the face, neck, and
head. Nearly all of the injuries suffered by people seeking treatment in emergency rooms were of ‘‘low severity,’’ and most were treated and released without being
admitted to the hospital or sent to another facility.
Many of the bites resulted from people attempting to
break up fights between animals.
CATS. Although cats are found in nearly a third of
U.S. households, cat bites are far less common than
dog bites. According to one study, cats inflict perhaps
400,000 harmful bites in the United States each year.
The tissue damage caused by cat bites is usually limited, but they carry a high risk of infection. Whereas
the infection rate for dog bite injuries is 15-20%, the
infection rate for cat bites is 30-40%.
HUMANS. Bites from mammals other than dogs

and cats are uncommon, with one exception—human
bites. There are approximately 70,000 human bites
each year in the United States. Because the human
mouth contains a multitude of potentially harmful
microorganisms, human bites are more infectious
than those of most other animals.
Arthropods
Arthropods are invertebrates belonging to the phylum Arthropoda, which includes insects, arachnids,

crustaceans, and other subgroups. There are more than
700,000 species in all. The list of arthropods that bite or
sting humans is extensive and includes lice, bedbugs, fleas,
mosquitoes, black flies, ants, chiggers, ticks, centipedes,
scorpions, and other species. Spiders, bees, and wasps are
the three kinds of arthropod that most often bite people.
SPIDERS. In the United States, only two kinds of
venomous spider are truly dangerous: widow spiders
and brown (violin or fiddle) spiders. The black widow,
which is found in every state but Alaska, is probably
the most notorious widow spider. It prefers dark, dry
places such as barns, garages, and outhouses, and also
lives under rocks and logs. Disturbing a female black
widow or its web may provoke a bite. Brown spiders
also prefer sheltered places, including clothing, and
may bite if disturbed.
BEES AND WASPS. Bees and wasps will sting
to defend their nests or if they are disturbed. Species

common to the United States include honeybees, bumblebees, yellow jackets, bald-faced hornets, brown hornets, and paper wasps. Of note are also Africanized bee
species, also called ‘‘killer bees’’ that have been found in
the United States since 1990. More than 50 Americans
die each year after being stung by a bee, wasp, or ant.
Almost all of those deaths are the result of allergic
reactions, and not of exposure to the venom itself.
Snakes
There are 20 species of venomous snakes in the
United States. These snakes are found in every state
except Maine, Alaska, and Hawaii. Each year about
8,000 Americans receive a venomous snakebite, but no
more than about 15 die, mostly from rattlesnake bites.
The venomous snakes of the United States are
divided into two families, the Crotalidae (pit vipers)
and the Elapidae. Pit vipers, named after the small
heat-sensing pit that lies between each eye and nostril,
are responsible for about 99% of the venomous snakebites suffered by Americans. Rattlesnakes, copperheads,
and cottonmouths (also called water moccasins) are pit
vipers. This family of snakes delivers its venom through
two long, hinged fangs in the upper jaw. Some pit vipers
carry a potent venom that can threaten the brain and
spinal cord. The venom of others, such as the copperheads, is less harmful.
The Elapidae family includes two kinds of venomous coral snakes indigenous to the southern and
western states. Because coral snakes are bashful creatures that come out only at night, they almost never
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

bite humans, and are responsible for approximately 25
bites a year in the United States. Coral snakes also
have short fangs and a small mouth, which lowers the
risk of a bite actually forcing venom into a person’s
body. However, their venom is quite poisonous.
Marine animals
Several varieties of marine animal may bite or sting.
Jellyfish and stingrays are two kinds that pose a threat
to people who live or vacation in coastal communities.

Causes and symptoms
Mammals
DOGS. A typical dog bite results in a laceration,
tear, puncture, or crush injury. Bites from large,
powerful dogs may even cause fractures and dangerous internal injuries. Also, dogs trained to attack may
bite repeatedly during a single episode. Infected bites
usually cause pain, cellulitis (inflammation of the connective tissues), and a pus-filled discharge at the
wound site within 8-24 hours. Most infections are
confined to the wound site, but many of the microorganisms in the mouths of dogs can cause systemic
and possibly life-threatening infections. Examples are
bacteremia and meningitis, especially severe in people
diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS) or other health condition that increases their
susceptibility to infection. Rabies is rare among pet
dogs in the United States, most of which have been
vaccinated against the disease. Tetanus is also rare but

which are vulnerable to infection because of their
comparatively poor blood supply. This is why cat
bites are much more likely to become infected than
dog bites. Also, people are less inclined to view cat
bites as dangerous and requiring immediate attention;
the risk that infection has set in by the time a medical
professional is consulted is thus greater.

Cat bites are mostly found on the arms and hands.
Sharp cat teeth typically leave behind a deep puncture
wound that can reach muscles, tendons, and bones,

cause infection.
Antibodies—Substances created by the body to
combat infection.
Antihistamines—Drugs used to treat allergic reactions by acting against a substance called histamine.
Arachnid—Large class of arthropods that includes

SPIDERS. As a rule, people rarely see a black
widow bite, nor do they feel the bite as it occurs. The
first (and possibly only) evidence that a person has
been bitten may be a mild swelling of the injured area
and two red puncture marks. Within a short time,
however, some victims begin to experience severe muscle cramps and rigidity of the abdominal muscles.
Other possible symptoms include excessive sweating,
nausea, vomiting, headaches, and vertigo as well as
breathing, vision, and speech problems.

A brown spider’s bite can lead to necrotic arachnidism, in which the tissue in an area of up to several
inches around the bite becomes necrotic (dies), producing an open sore that can take months or years to
disappear. In most cases, however, the bite simply
produces a hard, painful, itchy, and discolored area
that heals without treatment in 2-3 days. The bite may
also be accompanied by a fever, chills, edema (an
accumulation of excess tissue fluid), nausea and vomiting, dizziness, muscle and joint pain, and a rash.
BEES AND WASPS. The familiar symptoms of bee
and wasp stings include pain, redness, swelling, and
itchiness in the area of the sting. Multiple stings can
have much more severe consequences, such as anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction that occurs in
hypersensitive persons.

Lymph nodes—Small, kidney-shaped organs that
filter a fluid called lymph and that are part of the
body’s immune system.
Pus—A thick yellowish or greenish fluid composed
of the remains of dead white blood cells, pathogens
and decomposed cellular debris.

Venomous pit viper bites usually begin to swell
within 10 minutes and sometimes are painful. Other
symptoms include skin blisters and discoloration,
weakness, sweating, nausea, faintness, dizziness,
bruising, and tender lymph nodes. Severe poisoning
can also lead to tingling in the scalp, fingers, and
toes, muscle contractions, an elevated heart rate,
rapid breathing, large drops in body temperature and
blood pressure, vomiting of blood, and coma.

Children often bite other children, but those bites are
hardly ever severe. Human bites are capable of transmitting a wide range of dangerous diseases, including
hepatitis B, syphilis, and tuberculosis.

Many pit viper and coral snake bites (20-60%) fail
to poison (envenomate) their victim, or introduce only a
small amount of venom into the victim’s body. The
wounds, however, can still become infected by the harmful microorganisms that snakes carry in their mouths.

Human bites fall into two categories: occlusional
(true) bites and clenched-fist injuries. The former present a lower risk of infection. The latter, which are very
infectious and can permanently damage the hand,
usually result from a fist hitting teeth during a fight.
People often wait before seeking treatment for a
clenched-fist injury, with the result that about half of
such injuries are infected by the time they are seen by a
medical professional.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Coral snake bites are painful but may be hard to
see. One to seven hours after the bite, a bitten person
begins to experience the effects of the venom, which
include tingling at the wound site, weakness, nausea,
vomiting, excessive salivation, and irrational behavior. Major nerves of the body can become paralyzed
for 6-14 days, causing double vision, difficulty swallowing and speaking, respiratory failure, and other

problems. Six to eight weeks may be needed before
normal muscular strength is regained.
Marine animals
JELLYFISH. Jellyfish venom is delivered by barbs
called nematocysts, which are located on the creature’s tentacles and penetrate the skin of people who
brush up against them. Instantly painful and itchy
red lesions usually result. The pain can continue up
to 48 hours. Severe cases may lead to skin necrosis,
muscle spasms and cramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, excessive sweating, and other symptoms. In rare instances, cardiorespiratory failure may
also occur.
STINGRAYS. Tail spines are the delivery mechan-

ism for stingray venom. Deep puncture wounds result
that can cause an infection if pieces of spine become
embedded in the wound. A typical stingray injury
scenario involves a person who inadvertently steps
on a resting stingray and is lashed in the ankle by its
tail. Stingray venom produces immediate, excruciating
pain that lasts several hours. Sometimes the victim
suffers a severe reaction, including vomiting, diarrhea,
hemorrhage (bleeding), a drop in blood pressure, and
cardiac arrhythmia (disordered heart beat).

Diagnosis

HUMANS. Testing the blood of a person who has
been bitten for immunity to hepatitis B and other
diseases is always necessary after a human bite.
Ideally, the biter should be tested as well for the presence of transmissible disease. Clenched-fist injuries
often require evaluation by a hand surgeon or orthopedist. Because many people will deny having been in a
fight, medical professionals usually consider lacerations
over the fourth and fifth knuckles—the typical result of
a clenched-fist injury—to be evidence of a bite wound.
Medical professionals also look for indications of
spousal or child abuse when evaluating human bites.

Arthropods
SPIDERS. Because bites from widow spiders and
brown spiders require different treatments, capturing
and identifying the spider helps to establish diagnosis.

Snakes
Diagnosis relies on a physical examination of the
victim, information about the circumstances of the
bite, and a look at the snake itself (if it can safely be
killed and brought in for identification). Blood tests
and urinalysis supply important data on the victim’s
condition. Chest x-rays and electrocardiography (a
procedure for measuring heart activity) may also be
necessary.

Mammals
DOGS. Gathering information on the circum-

stances of a dog attack is a crucial part of treatment.
Medical professionals need to know when the attack
occurred (the chances of infection increase dramatically if the wound has been left untreated for more
than eight hours) and what led to the attack (unprovoked attacks are more likely to be associated with
rabies). A person’s general health must also be
assessed, including the tetanus immunization history
if any, as well as information concerning possible
allergies to medication and pre-existing health problems that may increase the risk of infection.
A physical examination requires careful scrutiny of
the wound, with special attention to possible bone,
joint, ligament, muscle, tendon, nerve, or blood-vessel
damage caused by deep punctures or severe crush injuries. Serious hand injuries should be evaluated by a
specialized surgeon. Most of the time, laboratory tests
for identifying the microorganisms in bite wounds are
performed if infection is present. X rays and other
diagnostic procedures may also be necessary.
CATS. The diagnostic procedures used for dog
bites also apply to cat bites.

558

Treatment
Mammals
DOGS. Minor dog bites can be treated at home. The
American Academy of Family Physicians recommends
gently washing the wound with soap and water and then
applying pressure to the injured area with a clean towel
to stop the bleeding. The next step is to apply antibiotic ointment and a sterile bandage to the wound.
To reduce swelling and fend off infection, ice should
be applied and the injured area kept elevated above
the level of the heart. The wound should be cleaned
and covered with ointment twice a day until it heals.

Any dog bite that does not stop bleeding after
15 minutes of pressure must be seen by a medical
professional. The same is true for bites that are deep
or gaping; for bites to the head, hands, or feet; and for
bites that may have broken a bone, damaged nerves,
or caused a major injury of another kind. Bite victims
must also watch for infection. A fever is one sign of
infection, as are redness, swelling, warmth, increased
tenderness, and pus at the wound site. Diabetics, people with AIDS or cancer, individuals who have not had
a tetanus shot in five years, and anyone else who has a
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Medical treatment of dog bites involves washing
the wound with an anti-infective solution. Removal of
dead and damaged tissue (under local, regional, or
general anesthetic) may be required after the wound
has been washed, and any person whose tetanus shots
are not up to date should receive a booster injection.
Some wounds are left open and allowed to heal on
their own, while others require stitches (stitching may
be delayed a few days if infection is a concern). Many
emergency departments prescribe antibiotics for all
people with dog bites, but some researchers suggest
that antibiotics are usually unnecessary and should
be limited to those whose injuries or other health
problems make them likely candidates for infection.
A follow-up visit after one or two days is generally
required for anyone who has received bite treatment.
CATS. Because of the high risk of infection, people
who are bitten by a cat should always see a doctor. Cat
scratches do not require professional medical treatment unless the wound appears infected or the
scratched person has a weakened immune system.

Medical treatment for cat bites generally follows
the procedures used for dog bites. Experts advise,
however, that cat-bite wounds should always be left
open to prevent infection. Persons who have been
bitten by cats generally receive antibiotics as a preventive measure.
HUMANS. Human bites should always be examined by a doctor. Such bites are usually treated with
antibiotics and left open because of the high risk of
infection. A study released in June 2004 showed that
routine use of antibiotics for human bites may not be
necessary, as physicians try to minimize overuse of
antibiotics. Superficial wounds in low-risk areas may
no longer need antibiotic treatment, but more serious
human bites to high-risk areas such as the hands
should be treated with antibiotics to prevent serious
infection. A person who has been bitten may also
require immunization against hepatitis B and other
diseases. Persons who are being treated for a
clenched-fist injury will require a daily follow-up
examination for 3-5 days.

Arthropods
SPIDERS. No spider bite should be ignored.
The antidote for severe widow spider bites is a substance called antivenin, which contains antibodies
taken from the blood serum of horses injected with
spider venom. Doctors exercise caution in using

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

antivenin, however, because it can trigger anaphylactic shock, a potentially deadly (though treatable) allergic reaction, and serum sickness, an inflammatory
response that can give rise to joint pain, a fever, rashes,
and other unpleasant, though rarely serious,
consequences.
An antivenin for brown spider bites exists as well,
but it is not yet available in the United States. The drug
dapsone, used to treat leprosy, can sometimes stop the
tissue death associated with a brown spider bite.
Necrotic areas may need debridement (removal of
dead and damaged tissue) and skin grafts. Pain medications, antihistamines, antibiotics, and tetanus shots are
a few of the other treatments that are sometimes necessary after a bite from a brown spider or widow spider.
BEES AND WASPS. Most stings can be treated at
home. A stinger that is stuck in the skin can be scraped
off with a blade, fingernail, credit card, or piece of
paper (using tweezers may push more venom out of
the venom sac and into the wound). The area should
be cleaned and covered with an ice pack. Aspirin and
other pain medications, oral antihistamines, and calamine lotion are good for treating minor symptoms.
Putting meat tenderizer on the wound has no effect.

Persons who have been stung and experience an
allergic reaction, or who are at risk due to their medical
history, require immediate medical attention. The danger
signs, which usually begin 10 minutes after an individual
is stung (though possibly not for several hours), include
nausea, faintness, chest pain, abdominal cramps,
diarrhea, and difficulty swallowing or breathing.
Snakes
Although most snakes are not venomous, any snakebite should immediately be examined at a hospital.
While waiting for emergency help to arrive, the victim
should wash the wound site with soap and water, and
then keep the injured area still and at a level lower than
the heart. Ice should never be used on the wound site
nor should attempts be made to suck out the venom.
Making a cut at the wound site is also dangerous. It is
important to stay calm and wait for emergency medical
aid if it can arrive quickly. Otherwise, the victim should
proceed directly to a hospital.
When the victim arrives at a hospital, the medical
staff must determine whether the bite was inflicted by
a venomous snake and, if so, whether envenomation
occurred and how much venom the person has
received. Patients may develop low blood pressure,
abnormal blood clotting, or severe pain, all of which
require aggressive treatment. Fortunately, the effects
of some snakebites can be counteracted with

antivenin. Minor rattlesnake envenomations can be
successfully treated without antivenin, as can copperhead and water-moccasin bites. However, coral snake
envenomations and the more dangerous rattlesnake
envenomations require antivenin, sometimes in large
amounts. Other treatment measures include antibiotics
to prevent infection and a tetanus booster injection.
Marine animals
JELLYFISH. Vinegar and other acidic substances
are used to neutralize jellyfish nematocysts still clinging to the skin, which are then scraped off. Anesthetic
ointments, antihistamine creams, and steroid lotions
applied to the skin are sometimes beneficial. Other
measures may be necessary to counter the many harmful effects of jellyfish stings, which, if severe, require
emergency medical care.
STINGRAYS. Stingray wounds should be washed
with saltwater and then soaked in very hot water for
30-90 minutes to neutralize the venom. Afterwards,
the wound should be examined by a doctor to ensure
that no pieces of spine remain.

Alternative treatment
Arthropods
Several alternative self-care approaches are used
to treat minor bee, wasp, and other arthropod stings,
including aromatherapy, ayurvedic medicine, flower
remedies, herbs, homeopathy, and nutritional therapy.

Prognosis
Mammals
Prompt treatment and recognizing that even
apparently minor bites can have serious consequences
are the keys to a good outcome after a mammal bite.

STINGRAYS. Stingray venom kills its human victims on rare occasions.

Prevention
Mammals
DOGS. The risk of a dog bite injury can be reduced
by avoiding sick or stray dogs, staying away from
dogfights (people often get bitten when they try to
separate the animals), and not behaving in ways that
might provoke or upset dogs, such as wrestling with
them or bothering them while they are sleeping, eating,
or looking after their puppies. Special precautions
need to be taken around infants and young children,
who must never be left alone with a dog. Pit bulls,
rottweilers, and German shepherds (responsible for
nearly half of all fatal dog attacks in the United
States in 1997-2000) are potentially dangerous pets in
households where children live or visit. For all breeds
of dog, obedience training as well as spaying or neutering lessen the chances of aggressive behavior.
CATS. Prevention involves warning children to
stay away from strange cats and to avoid rough play
and other behavior that can anger cats and cause them
to bite.

Arthropods
SPIDERS. Common-sense precautions include
clearing webs out of garages, outhouses, and other
places favored by venomous spiders; keeping one’s
hands away from places where spiders may be lurking;
and, when camping or vacationing, checking clothing,
shoes, and sleeping areas.

SPIDERS. Even without treatment, adults usually
recover from black widow bites after 2-3 days. Those
most at risk of dying are very young children, the
elderly, and people with high blood pressure. In the
case of brown spider bites, the risk of death is greatest
for children, though rare.

BEES AND WASPS. When possible, it is advised to
avoid the nests of bees and wasps and to not eat sweet
food or wear bright clothing, perfumes, or cosmetics
that attract bees and wasps.

BEES AND WASPS. The pain and other symptoms of
a bee or wasp sting normally fade away after a few
hours. People who are allergic to such stings, however,

Snakes
Snakes should not be kept as pets. Measures such
as mowing the lawn, keeping hedges trimmed, and
removing brush from the yard also discourages snakes
from living close to human dwellings. Tongs should be
used to move brush, lumber, and firewood, to avoid
exposing one’s hands to snakes that might be lying
underneath. Similarly, golfers should never use their
hands to retrieve golf balls from a water hole, since
snakes can be hiding in the rocks and weeds. Caution
is also necessary when walking through weedy or grassy
areas, and children should be prevented from playing in
weedy, vacant lots and other places where snakes may
live. Leather boots and long pants offer hikers and
campers some protection from bites. Approaching a
snake, even a dead one, can be dangerous, for the
venom of recently killed snakes may still be active.

Definition
Black lung disease is the common name for coal
workers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) or anthracosis, a
lung disease of older workers in the coal industry,
caused by inhalation, over many years, of small

breath, and respiratory and heart failure.
Fibrosis—The growth of scar tissue, often as a
response to injury, infection, or inflammation.

years; the disease typically affects workers over age 50.
Its common name comes from the fact that the inhalation of heavy deposits of coal dust makes miners lungs
look black instead of a healthy pink. Although people
who live in cities often have some black deposits in
their lungs from polluted air, coal miners have much
more extensive deposits.
In the years since the federal government has
regulated dust levels in coal mines, the number of
cases of black lung disease has fallen sharply. Since
the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969,
average dust levels have fallen from 8.0 mg. per cubic
meter to the current standard of 2.0 mg. per cubic
meter. The 1969 law also set up a black lung disability
benefits program to compensate coal miners who have
been disabled by on-the-job dust exposure.
Despite the technology available to control the
hazard, however, miners still run the risk of developing this lung disease. The risk is much lower today,
however; fewer than 10% of coal miners have any x
ray evidence of coal dust deposits. When there is such
evidence, it often shows up as only small black spots
less than 0.4 in (1 cm). in diameter, and may have been
caused by smoking rather than coal dust. This condition is called ‘‘simple CWP’’ and does not lead to
symptoms or disability.

Causes and symptoms
Since the particles of fine coal dust, which a miner
breathes when he is in the mines, cannot be destroyed
within the lungs or removed from them, builds up.
Eventually, this build-up causes thickening and

scarring, making the lungs less efficient in supplying
oxygen to the blood.
The primary symptom of the disease is shortness
of breath, which gradually gets worse as the disease
progresses. In severe cases, the patient may develop
cor pulmonale, an enlargement and strain of the right
side of the heart caused by chronic lung disease. This
may eventually cause right-sided heart failure.
Some patients develop emphysema (a disease in
which the tiny air sacs in the lungs become damaged,
leading to shortness of breath, and respiratory and
heart failure) as a complication of black lung disease.
Others develop a severe type of black lung disease
called progressive massive fibrosis, in which damage
continues in the upper parts of the lungs even after
exposure to the dust has ended. Scientists aren’t sure
what causes this serious complication. Some think
that it may be due to the breathing of a mixture of
coal and silica dust that is found in certain mines.
Silica is far more likely to lead to scarring than coal
dust alone.

Diagnosis
Black lung disease can be diagnosed by checking a
patient’s history for exposure to coal dust, followed by
a chest x-ray to discover if the characteristic spots in
the lungs caused by coal dust are present. A pulmonary
function test may aid in diagnosis.
X rays can detect black lung disease before it
causes any symptoms. If exposure to the dust is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment
There is no treatment or cure for this condition,
although it is possible to treat complications such as
lung infections and cor pulmonale. Further exposure
to coal dust must be stopped.

Prognosis
Those miners with simple CWP can lead a normal
life. However, patients who develop black lung disease
at an early age, or who have progressive massive
fibrosis, have a higher risk of premature death.

Prevention
The only way to prevent black lung disease is to
avoid long-term exposure to coal dust. Coal mines
may help prevent the condition by lowering coal dust
levels and providing protective clothes to coal
miners.

I Bladder cancer
Definition
Bladder cancer is a disease in which the cells lining
the urinary bladder lose the ability to regulate their
growth and start dividing uncontrollably. This abnormal growth results in a mass of cells that form a tumor.

Description
Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer
in the United States. The American Cancer Society
(ACS) estimated that in 2001, approximately 54,300
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

new cases of bladder cancer would be diagnosed
(about 39,200 men and 15,100 women), causing
approximately 12,400 deaths. The rates for men of
African descent and Hispanic men are similar and
are approximately one-half of the rate among white
non-Hispanic men. The lowest rate of bladder cancer
occurs in the Asian population. Among women, the
highest rates also occur in white non-Hispanic females
and are approximately twice the rate for Hispanics.
Women of African descent have higher rates of bladder cancer than Hispanic women.
The urinary bladder is a hollow muscular organ
that stores urine from the kidneys until it is excreted out
of the body. Two tubes called the ureters bring the urine
from the kidneys to the bladder. The urethra carries
the urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.
Bladder cancer has a very high rate of recurrence.
Even after superficial tumors are completely removed,
there is a 75% chance that new tumors will develop
in other areas of the bladder. Hence, patients need
frequent and thorough follow-up care.

Causes and symptoms
Although the exact cause of bladder cancer is not
known, smokers are twice as likely as nonsmokers to get
the disease. Hence, smoking is considered the greatest
risk factor for bladder cancer. Workers who are exposed
to certain chemicals used in the dye industry and in the
rubber, leather, textile, and paint industries are believed
to be at a higher risk for bladder cancer. The disease also
is three times more common in men than in women;
caucasians also are at an increased risk. The risk of
bladder cancer increases with age. Most cases are
found in people who are 50–70 years old. In 2003, studies
showed that hormone replacement therapy (HRT), a
treatment used by many postmenopausal women, significantly increased the risk of bladder and other cancers.
Frequent urinary infections, kidney and bladder
stones, and other conditions that cause long-term
irritation to the bladder may increase the risk of getting
bladder cancer. A past history of tumors in the bladder
also could increase one’s risk of getting other tumors.
One of the first warning signals of bladder cancer is
blood in the urine. Sometimes, there is enough blood to
change the color of the urine to a yellow-red or a dark
red. At other times, the color of the urine appears
normal but chemical testing of the urine reveals the
presence of blood cells. A change in bladder habits
such as painful urination, increased frequency of
urination and a feeling of needing to urinate but not
being able to do so are some of the signs of possible

bladder cancer. All of these symptoms also may be
caused by conditions other than cancer, but it is important to see a doctor and have the symptoms evaluated.
When detected early and treated appropriately, patients
have a very good chance of being cured completely.

Diagnosis
If a doctor has any reason to suspect bladder cancer, several tests can help find out if the disease is
present. As a first step, a complete medical history
will be taken to check for any risk factors. A thorough
physical examination will be conducted to assess all the
signs and symptoms. Laboratory testing of a urine
sample will help to rule out the presence of a bacterial
infection. In a urine cytology test, the urine is examined
under a microscope to look for any abnormal or cancerous cells. A catheter (tube) can be advanced into
the bladder through the urethra, and a salt solution is
passed through it to wash the bladder. The solution
can then be collected and examined under a microscope
to check for the presence of cancerous cells.
A test known as the intravenous pyelogram (IVP)
is an x–ray examination that is done after a dye is
injected into the blood stream through a vein in the
arm. The dye travels through the blood stream and
then reaches the kidneys to be excreted. It clearly outlines the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra.
Multiple x rays are taken to detect any abnormality
in the lining of these organs.
564

The physician may use a procedure known as a
cystoscopy to view the inside of the bladder. A thin
hollow lighted tube is introduced into the bladder
through the urethra. If any suspicious looking masses
are seen, a small piece of the tissue can be removed
from it using a pair of biopsy forceps. The tissue is then
examined microscopically to verify if cancer is present,
and if so, to identify the type of cancer.
If cancer is detected and there is evidence to indicate that it has metastasized (spread) to distant sites in
the body, imaging tests such as chest x rays, computed
tomography scans (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be done to determine which organs
are affected. Bladder cancer generally tends to spread
to the lungs, liver, and bone.

Treatment
Treatment for bladder cancer depends on the
stage of the tumor. The patient’s medical history,
overall health status, and personal preferences also
are taken into account when deciding on an appropriate treatment plan. The three standard modes of treatment available for bladder cancer are surgery,
radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. In addition,
newer treatment methods such as photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy also are being investigated in
clinical trials.
Surgery is considered an option only when the disease is in its early stages. If the tumor is localized to a

small area and has not spread to the inner layers of the
bladder, then the surgery is done without cutting open
the abdomen. A cytoscope is introduced into the bladder through the urethra, and the tumor is removed
through it. This procedure is called a transurethral
resection (TUR). Passing a high-energy laser beam
through the cytoscope and burning the cancer may
treat any remaining cancer. This procedure is known
as electrofulguration. If the cancer has invaded the walls
of the bladder, surgery will be done through an incision
in the abdomen. Cancer that is not very large can be
removed by partial cystectomy, a procedure where a
part of the bladder is removed. If the cancer is large or
is present in more than one area of the bladder, a radical
cystectomy is done. In this operation, the entire bladder
and adjoining organs also may be removed. In men, the
prostate is removed, while in women, the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes are removed.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Photodynamic therapy—A novel mode of treatment that uses a combination of special light
rays and drugs are used to destroy the cancerous
cells. First, the drugs, which make cancerous cells
more susceptible to the light rays, are introduced
into the bladder. Then the light is shone on the
bladder to kill the cells.
Radiation therapy—Treatment using high-energy
radiation from x-ray machines, cobalt, radium, or
other sources.
Radical cystectomy—A surgical procedure that is
used when the cancer is in more than one area of
the bladder. Along with the bladder, the adjoining
organs also are removed. In men, the prostate is
removed, while in women, the ovaries, fallopian
tubes and uterus may be removed.
Stoma—An artificial opening between two cavities or between a cavity and the surface of the
body.
Transurethral resection—A surgical procedure to
remove abnormal tissue from the bladder. The technique involves the insertion of an instrument called a
cytoscope into the bladder through the urethra, and
the tumor is removed through it.
Urostomy—A surgical procedure consisting of cutting the ureters from the bladder and connecting
them to an opening (see stoma) on the abdomen,
allowing urine to flow into a collection bag.

If the entire urinary bladder is removed, an alternate place must be created for the urine to be stored
before it is excreted out of the body. To do this, a piece
of intestine is converted into a small bag and attached
to the ureters. This is then connected to an opening
(stoma) that is made in the abdominal wall. The procedure is called a urostomy. In some urostomy procedures, the urine from the intestinal sac is routed into a
bag that is placed over the stoma in the abdominal
wall. The bag is hidden by the clothing and has to be
emptied occasionally by the patient. In a different
procedure, the urine is collected in the intestinal sac,
but there is no bag on the outside of the abdomen. The
intestinal sac has to be emptied by the patient, by
placing a drainage tube through the stoma.

destroy any remaining cancer cells that may not have
been removed during surgery. If the tumor is in a
location that makes surgery difficult, or if it is large,
radiation may be used before surgery to shrink the
tumor. In cases of advanced bladder cancer, radiation
therapy is used to ease the symptoms such as pain,
bleeding, or blockage. Radiation can be delivered by
external beam, where a source of radiation that is
outside the body focuses the radiation on the area of
the tumor. Occasionally, a small pellet of radioactive
material may be placed directly into the cancer. This is
known as interstitial radiation therapy.
Chemotherapy uses anticancer drugs to destroy
the cancer cells that may have migrated to distant
sites. The drugs are introduced into the bloodstream
by injecting them into a vein in the arm or taking
them orally in pill form. Generally a combination of
drugs is more effective than any single drug in treating
bladder cancer. Chemotherapy may be given following surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells. It also
may be given even when no remaining cancer cells
can be seen. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy.
Anticancer drugs, including thiotepa, doxorubicin,
and mitomycin, also may be instilled directly into
the bladder (intravesicular chemotherapy) to treat
superficial tumors. In 2003, the FDA was giving fast
track designation to a form of paclitaxel, a common
anticancer drug, that was shown effective in treating
metastatic or locally advanced bladder cancer.
A 2003 report stated that giving patients with bladder cancer chemotherapy followed by surgery may
improve their outcomes. In the study of 307 patients,
those with this combination of therapy lived two
years longer than those treated with surgery only.
Immunotherapy, or biological therapy, uses the
body’s own immune cells to fight the disease. To treat
superficial bladder cancer, bacille Calmette-Guerin
(BCG) may be instilled directly into the bladder. BCG
is a weakened (attenuated) strain of the tuberculosis
bacillus that stimulates the body’s immune system to
fight the cancer. This therapy has been shown to be
effective in controlling superficial bladder cancer.
Photodynamic treatment is a novel mode of treatment that uses special chemicals and light to kill the
cancerous cells. First, a drug is introduced into the
bladder that makes the cancer cells more susceptible
to light. Following that, a special light is shone on the
bladder in an attempt to destroy the cancerous cells.
New treatments are continuously being investigated. Scientists have made great strides in gene mapping and research in the twenty-first century. In 2003,
a type of gene therapy was being tested on patients
566

with bladder cancer with success, but further enhancements were needed.

Prognosis
When detected in early stages, the prognosis for
those with bladder cancer is excellent. At least 94% of
people survive five years or more after initial diagnosis. However, if the disease has spread to the nearby
tissues, the survival rate drops to 49%. If it has metastasized to distant organs such as the lung and liver,
commonly only 6% of patients will survive five years
or more. As newer treatment methods are developed,
some prognoses improve. For example, neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, or giving certain chemotherapy drugs
following surgery, may help people live up to
31 months longer than previous treatments allowed.

Prevention
Since the exact causes of bladder cancer are not
known, there is no certain way to prevent it. Avoiding
risk factors whenever possible is the best alternative.
Since smoking doubles one’s risk of getting bladder cancer, avoiding tobacco may prevent at least half
the deaths that result from bladder cancer. Taking
appropriate safety precautions when working with
organic cancer-causing chemicals is another way of
preventing the disease. Women should discuss the
risks vs. benefits of hormone replacement therapy
with their physicians.
If a person has had a history of bladder cancer, or
has been exposed to cancer-causing chemicals, he or
she is considered to be at an increased risk of getting
bladder cancer. Similarly, kidney stones, frequent urinary infections, and other conditions that cause longterm irritation to the bladder also increase the chance
of getting the disease. In such cases, it is advisable to
undergo regular screening tests such as urine cytology,
cystoscopy and x rays of the urinary tract, so that
bladder cancer can be detected at its early stages and
treated appropriately.

Urinary tract—The system of organs that produces
and expels urine from the body. This system begins
at the kidneys, where the urine is formed; passes
through the bladder; and, ends at the urethra,
where urine is expelled.

Causes and symptoms
While the exact causes of the formation of bladder
stones are not completely understood, bladder stones
usually occur because of urinary tract infection (UTI),
obstruction of the urinary tract, enlargement of the
prostate gland in men, or the presence of foreign
bodies in the urinary tract. Diet and the amount of
fluid intake also appear to be important factors in the
development of bladder stones.
Ninety-five percent of all bladder stones occur
in men, most of who have an enlarged prostate gland or
a UTI. These stones are rarely seen in children or
in African Americans. People with gout may develop bladder stones composed almost entirely of uric acid.
The symptoms of bladder stones may become
evident when the wall of the bladder is scratched or
when the urinary tract becomes obstructed by the
stone. These symptoms include:

Bladder stones are crystalline masses that form
from the minerals and proteins, which naturally
occur in urine. These types of stones are much less
common than kidney stones.

Description
Bladder stones can form anywhere in the urinary
tract before depositing in the bladder. They begin as tiny
granules about the size of a grain of sand, but they can
grow to more than an inch in diameter. These stones
can block the flow of urine causing pain and difficulty
with urination. They can also scratch the bladder
wall, which may lead to bleeding or infection.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Some people with bladder stones also may experience an inability to control urination (urinary
incontinence).

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of bladder stones is usually made
after a physical examination, which may include a
rectal examination to check for enlargement of the
prostate gland. Urine tests are then used to determine

Treatment
Many bladder stones can be passed out of the
body in the urine. People with small bladder stones
will be asked to increase their fluid intakes to at least
six to eight eight-ounce glasses of water per day to
increase urinary output. If the stones do not pass
after two weeks, or if the patient’s symptoms become
worse, further medical treatment may be required.
A large bladder stone, or small stone that the patient
cannot pass in the urine, may be broken up into smaller
stones using ultrasound (shock waves). These smaller
stones may then pass in the urine. Stones that cannot
be broken into pieces by these methods, or that the
patient cannot pass, may have to be surgically removed.

Alternative treatment
Traditional herbal remedies for bladder stones
include celery seed and horsetail. Also, because incomplete bladder emptying may cause bladder stones, many
patients may benefit from methods and remedies aimed
at improving overall bladder function. These include
Kegel exercises, which are used to strengthen the
muscles involved in urination; herbal supplements
(cornsilk, hydrangea, juniper berries, parsley, and uva
ursi) used to increase urine flow and flush out sediment
from the bladder; and, the consumption of cranberry
juice and/or fresh, unsweetened, lemon juice.
Cranberry juice helps to control urinary tract infection
and contains a chemical that coats the walls of the
bladder, making them more resistant to infection.
Lemon juice helps to flush out the urinary system.

Prognosis
Most bladder stones can be, and are, passed out of
the body in the urine without any permanent damage
to the bladder or the rest of the urinary tract.
However, most bladder stones arise from an underlying medical condition. Therefore, if this medical
condition is not corrected approximately half of all
patients will experience a recurrence of bladder stones
within five years.

Prevention
Bladder stones may, in some cases, be prevented
by the patient receiving prompt medical treatment for

I Bladder training
Definition
Bladder training is a behavioral modification treatment technique for urinary incontinence that involves
placing a patient on a toileting schedule. The time
interval between urination is gradually increased in
order to train the patient to remain continent.

Purpose
Bladder training is used to treat urinary urge
incontinence. Urge incontinence occurs when an
individual feels a sudden need to urinate and cannot
control the urge to do so and, as a consequence, involuntarily loses urine before making it to the toilet.

Precautions
Incontinence may be controlled through a number of invasive and non-invasive treatment options,
including Kegel exercises, biofeedback, bladder
training, medication, insertable incontinence devices,
and surgery. Each patient should undergo a full
diagnostic work-up to determine the type and cause
of the incontinence in order to determine the best
course of treatment.

Description
Bladder training may be prescribed and implemented by a general physician, urologist, or urogynecologist. A urination schedule is created for the patient.
The schedule typically starts out with fairly short intervals between bathroom breaks (e.g., an hour). As soon
as the patient is able to consistently remain continent
for several days at a certain toileting time interval, the
time span is increased. Bladder training continues until
the patient regularly achieves continence at a time
interval he/she feels comfortable with.

Preparation
A complete evaluation to determine the cause of
urinary incontinence is critical to proper treatment.
A thorough medical history and physical examination
should be performed on patients considering bladder
training. Diagnostic testing may include x rays, ultrasound, urine tests, and a physical examination of
the pelvis. It may include a series of exams called
urodynamic testing that measure bladder pressure
and capacity and the urinary flow. The patient may
also be asked to keep a diary of their urination output
and frequency and episodes of incontinence over a
period of several days or a week.

Risks
Bladder training may not be successful in all
patients with urge incontinence. Patients who demonstrate a strong desire to control their continence and
are committed to sticking with a training program
tend to have the most success with bladder training.

Normal results
Patients who undergo successful bladder training
gain complete or improved control over their urination. In some cases, additional alternate treatment
such as biofeedback or pelvic muscle exercises may

I Blastomycosis
Definition
Blastomycosis is an infection caused by inhaling
microscopic particles (spores) produced by the fungus
Blastomyces dermatitidis. Blastomycosis may be limited
to the lungs or also involve the skin and bones. In its
most severe form, the infection can spread throughout
the body and involve many organ systems (systemic).

Description
Blastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by
Blastomyces dermatitidis. Although primarily an airborne disease, farmers and gardeners may become
infected from contact with spores in the soil through
cuts and scrapes. The fungus that causes the disease is
found in moist soil and wood in the southeastern
United States, the Mississippi River valley, southern
Canada, and Central America. Blastomycosis is also
called Gilchrist’s disease, Chicago disease, or North
American blastomycosis. Another South and Central
American disease, paracoccidioidomycosis, is sometimes called South American blastomycosis, but
despite the similar name, this disease is substantially
different from North American blastomycosis. Canine
blastomycosis, a common dog disease, is caused by the
same fungus that infects humans. However, people do
not get this disease from their dogs except only very
rarely through dog bites.
Blastomycosis is a rare disease infecting only
about 4 in every 100,000 people. It is at least six
times more common in men than in women and
tends to more often infect children and individuals in
the 30–50 year old age group. People who have

diabetes mellitus or who are taking drugs that suppress the immune system (immunocompromised) are
more likely to develop blastomycosis. Although people with AIDS can get blastomycosis because of their
weakened immune system, blastomycosis has not been
one of the more common fungal infections associated
with AIDS.

Causes and symptoms
Once inhaled, the spores of B. dermatitidis can
lodge in the lungs and cause a localized inflammation.
This is known as primary pulmonary blastomycosis.
The disease does not spread from one person to
another. In the early stages, symptoms may include a
dry cough, fever, heavy sweating, fatigue, and a general
feeling of ill health. In approximately 25% of blastomycosis cases, only the lungs are affected. As the disease progresses, small lesions form in the lungs causing
the air sacs deep within the lungs (alveoli) to break
down and form small cavities.
In another 35%, the disease involves both the
lungs and the skin. Bumps develop on the skin,
gradually becoming small, white, crusted blisters
filled with pus. The blisters break open, creating
abscesses that do not heal. Approximately 19% of
infected people have skin sores without infection in
the lungs.
The remaining approximately 20% of the
infected population has blastomycosis that has
spread or disseminated to other systems of the
body. Symptoms may include pain and lesions on
one or more bones, the male genitalia, and/or parts
of the central nervous system. The liver, spleen,
lymph nodes, heart, adrenal glands, and digestive
system may also be infected.

Spores—The small, thick-walled reproductive
structures of fungi.
Sputum—Mucus and other matter coughed up
from airways.
Systemic—Not localized to a single area of the
body but, instead, involving one or more body
systems.

Diagnosis
A positive diagnosis of blastomycosis is made when
the fungus B. dermatitidis is identified by direct microscopic examination of body fluids such as sputum and
prostate fluid or in tissue samples (biopsies) from the
lung or skin. Another way to diagnose blastomycosis is
to culture and isolate the fungus from a sample of
sputum. Chest x rays are used to assess lung damage,
but alone cannot lead to a definitive diagnosis of blastomycosis because any damage caused by other diseases, such as by pneumonia or tuberculosis, may
appear look on the x ray. Because its symptoms vary
widely, blastomycosis is often misdiagnosed.

Treatment
Blastomycosis must be treated or it will gradually
lead to death. Treatment with the fungicidal drug
ketoconazole (Nizoral) taken orally is effective in
about 75% of patients. Amphotericin B (Fungizone)
given intravenously is also very effective, but it has
more toxic side effects than ketoconazole. Treatment
with amphotericin B usually requires hospitalization,
and the patient may also receive other drugs to minimize the its side effects.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Alternative treatment for fungal infections
focuses on creating an internal environment where
the fungus cannot survive. This is accomplished by
eating a diet low in dairy products, sugars, including
honey and fruit juice, and foods like beer that contain
yeast. This is complemented by a diet consisting, in
large part, of uncooked and unprocessed foods.
Supplements of vitamins C, E, A-plus, and B complex
may also be useful. Lactobacillus acidophilus and
Bifidobacterium will replenish the good bacteria in
the intestines. Some antifungal herbs, like garlic
(Allium sativum), can be consumed in relatively large
doses and for an extended period of time in order to
increase effectiveness. A variety of antifungal herbs,
such as myrrh (Commiphora molmol), tea tree oil
(Melaleuca spp.), citrus seed extract, pau d’arco tea
(Tabebuia impetiginosa), and garlic may also be
applied directly to the infected skin.

Prognosis
Left untreated, blastomycosis gradually leads to
death. When treated, however, patients begin to
improve within one week and, with intensive treatment, may be cured within several weeks. The highest
rate of recovery is among patients who only have skin
lesions. People with the disseminated form of the disease are least likely to be cured and and most likely to
suffer a relapse.

Prevention
Because the fungus that causes blastomycosis is
airborne and microscopic, the only form of prevention is to avoid visiting areas where it is found in the
soil. For many people this is impractical. Since the
disease is rare, people who maintain general good
health do not need to worry much about infection.

I Bleeding time
Definition
Bleeding time is a crude test of hemostasis (the arrest
or stopping of bleeding). It indicates how well platelets
interact with blood vessel walls to form blood clots.

Purpose
Bleeding time is used most often to detect qualitative defects of platelets, such as Von Willebrand’s
disease. The test helps identify people who have
defects in their platelet function. This is the ability
of blood to clot following a wound or trauma.
Normally, platelets interact with the walls of blood
vessels to cause a blood clot. There are many factors
in the clotting mechanism, and they are initiated by
platelets. The bleeding time test is usually used on
patients who have a history of prolonged bleeding
after cuts, or who have a family history of bleeding
disorders. Also, the bleeding time test is sometimes
performed as a preoperative test to determine a
patient’s likely bleeding response during and after
surgery. However, in patients with no history of
bleeding problems, or who are not taking antiinflammatory drugs, the bleeding time test is not
usually necessary.

Precautions
Before administering the test, patients should be
questioned about what medications they may be
taking. Some medications will adversely affect the
results of the bleeding time test. These medications
include anticoagulants, diuretics, anticancer drugs, sulfonamides, thiazide, aspirin and aspirin-containing
preparations, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs. The test may also be affected by anemia (a
deficiency in red blood cells). Since the taking of
aspirin or related drugs are the most common cause
of prolonged bleeding time, no aspirin should be taken
two weeks prior to the test.

There are four methods to perform the bleeding
test. The Ivy method is the traditional format for this
test. In the Ivy method, a blood pressure cuff is
placed on the upper arm and inflated to 40 mM
Hg. A lancet or scalpel blade is used to make a stab
wound on the underside of the forearm. An automatic, spring-loaded blade device is most commonly
used to make a standard-sized cut. The area stabbed

KEY TERMS

is selected so that no superficial or visible veins are
cut. These veins, because of their size, may have
longer bleeding times, especially in people with
bleeding defects. The time from when the stab
wound is made until all bleeding has stopped is
measured and is called the bleeding time. Every 30
seconds, filter paper or a paper towel is used to draw
off the blood. The test is finished when bleeding has
stopped completely.
The three other methods of performing the bleeding test are the template, modified template, and Duke
methods. The template and modified template methods are variations of the Ivy method. A blood pressure
cuff is used and the skin on the forearm prepared as in
the Ivy method. A template is placed over the area to
be stabbed and two incisions are made in the forearm
using the template as a location guide. The main difference between the template and the modified method
is the length of the cut made.
For the Duke method, a nick is made in an ear
lobe or a fingertip is pricked to cause bleeding. As in
the Ivy method, the test is timed from the start of
bleeding until bleeding is completely stopped. The
disadvantage to the Duke method is that the pressure
on the blood veins in the stab area is not constant and
the results achieved are less reliable. The advantage to
the Duke method is that no scar remains after the test.
The other methods may result in a tiny, hairline scar
where the wound was made. However, this is largely a
cosmetic concern.

Preparation
There is no special preparation required of the
patient for this test. The area to be stabbed should be
wiped clean with an alcohol pad. The alcohol should
be left on the skin long enough for it to kill bacteria at
the wound site. The alcohol must be removed before
stabbing the arm because alcohol will adversely affect
the tests results by inhibiting clotting.

Aftercare
If a prolonged bleeding time is caused by unknown
factors or diseases, further testing is required to identify
the exact cause of the bleeding problem.
572

A normal bleeding time for the Ivy method is less
than five minutes from the time of the stab until all
bleeding from the wound stops. Some texts extend the
normal range to eight minutes. Normal values for the
template method range up to eight minutes, while for
the modified template methods, up to 10 minutes is
considered normal. Normal for the Duke method is
three minutes.

Abnormal results
A bleeding time that is longer than normal is an
abnormal result. The test should be stopped if the
patient hasn’t stopped bleeding by 20-30 minutes.
Bleeding time is longer when the normal function of
platelets is impaired, or there are a lower-than-normal
number of platelets in the blood.
A longer-than-normal bleeding time can indicate
that one of several defects in hemostasis is present,
including severe thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, vascular defects, Von Willebrand’s disease, or
other abnormalities.

I Bleeding varices
Definition
Bleeding varices are bleeding, dilated (swollen)
veins in the esophagus (gullet), or the upper part of
the stomach, caused by liver disease.

Description
Engorged veins are called varices (plural of varix).
Varices may occur in the lining of the esophagus, the
tube that connects the mouth to the stomach, or in the
upper part of the stomach. Such varices are called
esophageal varices. These varices are fragile and can
bleed easily because veins are not designed to handle
high internal pressures.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Liver disease often causes an increase in the
blood pressure in the main veins that carry blood
from the stomach and intestines to the liver (portal
veins). As the pressure in the portal veins increases,
the veins of the stomach and esophagus swell, until
they eventually become varices. Bleeding varices are a
life-threatening complication of this increase in blood
pressure (portal hypertension). The most common
cause of bleeding varices is cirrhosis of the liver
caused by chronic alcohol abuse or hepatitis.
Bleeding varices occur in approximately one in
every 10,000 people.
Symptoms of bleeding varices include:


vomiting blood, sometimes in massive amounts



black, tarry stools



decreased urine output



excessive thirst



nausea



vomiting



blood in the vomit

If bleeding from the varices is severe, a patient
may go into shock from the loss of blood, characterized by pallor, a rapid and weak pulse, rapid and
shallow respiration, and lowered systemic blood
pressure.

Diagnosis
Bleeding varices may be suspected in a patient
who has any of the above-mentioned symptoms, and
who has either been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the
liver or who has a history of prolonged alcohol abuse.
The definitive diagnosis is established via a specialized
type of endoscopy, namely, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), a procedure that involves the visual
examination of the lining of the esophagus, stomach,
and upper duodenum with a flexible fiberoptic
endoscope.

KEY TERMS
Cirrhosis of the liver—A type of liver disease, most
often caused by chronic alcohol abuse. It is
characterized by scarring of the liver, which
leads to an increase in the blood pressure in the
portal veins.
Endoscopy—Medical imaging technique for visualizing the interior of a hollow organ.
Esophagus—The tube in the body which takes food
from the mouth to the stomach.
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)—An imaging test that involves visually examining the lining
of the esophagus, stomach, and upper duodenum
with a flexible fiberoptic endoscope.
Portal hypertension—Portal hypertension forces
the blood flow backward, causing the portal veins
to enlarge and the emergence of bleeding varices
across the esophagus and stomach from the
pressure in the portal vein. Portal hypertension is
most commonly caused by cirrhosis, but can also
be seen in portal vein obstruction from unknown
causes.
Portal veins—The main veins that carry blood from
the stomach and intestines to the liver.
Shock—A state of depression of the vital processes
of the body characterized by pallor, a rapid and
weak pulse, rapid and shallow respiration, and
lowered blood pressure. Shock results from severe
trauma, such as crushing injuries, hemorrhage,
burns, or major surgery.
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
(TIPS)—A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic
shunt (TIPS) is a radiology procedure in which a
tubular device is inserted in the middle of the liver
to redirect the blood flow.
Varices—A type of varicose vein that develops in
veins in the linings of the esophagus and upper
stomach when these veins fill with blood and
swell due to an increase in blood pressure in the
portal veins.

Treatment
The objective during treatment of bleeding
varices is to stop and/or prevent bleeding and to
restore/maintain normal blood circulation throughout the body. Patients with severe bleeding should be
treated in intensive care since uncontrolled bleeding
can lead to death.
Initial treatment of bleeding varices begins
with standard resuscitation, including intravenous
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

fluids and blood transfusions as needed. Definitive
treatment is usually endoscopic, with the endoscope used to locate the sites of the bleeding. An
instrument, inserted along with the endoscope, is
used either to inject these sites with a clotting agent
or to tie off the bleeding sites with tiny rubber
bands.

Bleeding varices

Causes and symptoms

Blepharoplasty

Repeated endoscopic treatments (usually four/
six) are generally required to eliminate the varices
and to prevent the recurrence of bleeding. These endoscopic techniques are successful in about 90 percent
of cases.
Patients who cannot be treated endoscopically
may be considered for an alternative procedure called
TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt).
This procedure involves placing a hollow metal
tube (shunt) in the liver connecting the portal veins
with the hepatic veins (veins that leave the liver and
drain to the heart). This shunt lowers the pressure in
the portal veins and prevents bleeding and portal
hypertension. The TIPS procedure is performed by a
radiologist and has become an accepted method for
reducing portal vein pressure since 1992. Although the
procedure continues to evolve, TIPS can routinely be
created in more than 93% of patients.
Medications aimed at controlling bleeding
may also be prescribed. These include propanolol,
vasopressin, octreotide acetate, and isosorbide
mononitrate.

Alternative treatment
Some alternative treatments are aimed at preventing the cirrhosis of the liver that often causes bleeding
varices and most are effective. However, once a patient
has reached the bleeding varice stage, standard intervention to stop the bleeding is required or the patient
may die.

Prognosis
Bleeding varices represent one of the most feared
complications of portal hypertension. They contribute
to the estimated 32,000 deaths per year attributed to
cirrhosis. Half or more of patients who survive episodes
of bleeding varices are at risk of renewed esophageal
bleeding during the first one to two years. The risk of
recurrence can be lowered by endoscopic and drug
treatment. Prognosis is usually more related to the
underlying liver disease. Approximately 30 to 50 percent
of people with bleeding varices will die from this condition within the six weeks of the first bleeding episode.

Prevention
The best way to possibly prevent the development
or recurrence of bleeding varices is to eliminate the risk
factors for cirrhosis of the liver. The most common
cause of cirrhosis is prolonged alcohol abuse, and alcohol consumption must be completely eliminated. People
574

with hepatitis B or hepatitis C also have an increased
risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver. Vaccination
against hepatitis B and avoidance of intravenous drug
usage reduce the risk of contracting hepatitis.

I Blepharoplasty
Definition
Blepharoplasty is a cosmetic surgical procedure
that removes fat deposits, excess tissue, or muscle
from the eyelids to improve the appearance of the eyes.

Purpose
The primary use of blepharoplasty is for improving the cosmetic appearance of the eyes. In some older
patients, however, sagging and excess skin surrounding the eyes can be so extensive that it limits the range
of vision. In those cases, blepharoplasty serves a more
functional purpose.

Precautions
Before performing blepharoplasty, the surgeon will
assess whether the patient is a good candidate for the

treatment. A good medical history is important. The
surgeon will want to know about any history of thyroid
disease, hypertension, or eye problems, which may
increase the risk of complications.

Description
Blepharoplasty can be performed on the upper or
lower eyelid; it can involve the removal of excess skin
and fat deposits and the tightening of selected muscles
surrounding the eyelids. The goal is to provide a more
youthful appearance.
The surgeon will begin by deciding whether excess
skin, fat deposits, or muscle looseness are at fault.
While the patient is sitting upright, the surgeon will
mark on the skin where incisions will be made. Care
will be taken to hide the incision lines in the natural
skin folds above and below the eye. The patient then
receives injections of a local anesthetic to numb the
pain. Many surgeons also give the patient a sedative
intravenously during the procedure.
After a small, crescent-shaped section of eyelid
skin is removed, the surgeon will work to tease out
small pockets of fat that have collected in the lids. If
muscle looseness is also a problem, the surgeon may
trim tissue or add a stitch to pull it tighter. Then the
incision is closed with stitches.
In some patients, fat deposits in the lower eyelid
may be the only or primary problem. Such patients
may be good candidates for transconjunctival blepharoplasty. In this procedure the surgeon makes no
incision on the surface of the eyelid, but instead enters

from behind to tease out the fat deposits from a small
incision. The advantage of this procedure is that there
is no visible scar.

Preparation
Prior to surgery, patients meet with their surgeon to discuss the procedure, clarify the results
that can be achieved, and discuss the potential problems that might occur. Having realistic expectations is important in any cosmetic procedure.
Patients will learn, for example, that although blepharoplasty can improve the appearance of the eyelid, other procedures, such as a chemical peel, will be
575

Blood-viscosity reducing drugs

necessary to reduce the appearance of wrinkles
around the eye. Some surgeons prescribe vitamin C
and vitamin K for 10 days prior to surgery in the
belief that this helps the healing process. Patients are
also told to stop smoking in the weeks before and
after the procedure, and to refrain from alcohol and
aspirin.

Aftercare
An antibiotic ointment is applied to the line of
stitches for several days after surgery. Patients also
take an antibiotic several times a day to prevent
infection. Ice-cold compresses are applied to the
eyes continuously for the first day following surgery, and several times a day for the next week or
so, to reduce swelling. Some swelling and discoloration around the eyes is expected with the procedure.
Patients should avoid aspirin or alcoholic beverages
for one week and should limit their activities,
including bending, straining, and lifting. The
stitches are removed a few days after surgery.
Patients can generally return to their usual activities
within a week to 10 days.

Risks
As with any surgical procedure, blepharoplasty can lead to infection and scarring. Good
care of the wound following surgery can minimize
these risks. In cases where too much skin is
removed from the eyelids, the patient may have
difficulty closing his eyes. Dry eye syndrome may
develop, requiring the use of artificial tears to
lubricate the eye. In a rare complication, called
retrobulbar hematoma, a pocket of blood forms
behind the eyeball.

Normal results
Most patients can expect good results from blepharoplasty, with the removal of excess eyelid skin
and fat producing a more youthful appearance.
Some swelling and discoloration is expected immediately following the procedure, but this clears in time.
Small scars will be left where the surgeon has made
incisions; but these generally lighten in appearance
over several months, and, if placed correctly, will not
be readily noticeable.

Abnormal results
As noted, if too much excess skin is removed
from the upper eyelid, the patient may be unable to
576

close his eyes completely; another surgery to correct
the defect may be required. Similarly, too much skin
can be removed from the lower eyelid, allowing too
much of the white of the eye (the sclera) to show. In
extreme cases, the lower lid may be pulled down too
far, revealing the underlying tissue. Called an ectropion, this, too, may require a second, corrective
surgery. The eye’s ability to make tears may also be
compromised, leading to dry eye syndrome. Dry eye
syndrome is potentially dangerous; in rare cases
it leads to damage to the cornea of the eye and
vision loss.

I Blood clots
Definition
A blood clot is a thickened mass in the blood
formed by tiny substances called platelets. Clots form
to stop bleeding, such as at the site of cut. But clots
577

Blood clots

should not form when blood is moving through the
body; when clots form inside blood vessels or when
blood has a tendency to clot too much, serious health
problems can occur.

Description
As soon as a blood vessel wall is damaged—by a
cut or similar trauma—a series of reactions normally
takes place to activate platelets to stop the bleeding.
Platelets are the tiny particles in the blood released
into the bone marrow that gather together and form
a barrier to further bleeding. Several proteins in the
body are involved in the platelets clotting process.
Chief among these proteins are collagen, thrombin,
and von Willebrand factor. Collagen and thrombin
help platelets stick together. As platelets gather at
the site of injury, they change in shape from round
to spiny, releasing proteins and other substances
that help catch more platelets and clotting proteins.
This enlarges the plug that becomes a blood
clot. Formation of blood clots also is called
‘‘coagulation’’.
The series of reactions that cause proteins and
platelets to create blood clots also are balanced by
other reactions that stop the clotting process and dissolve clots after the blood vessel has healed. If this
control system fails, minor blood vessel injuries can
trigger clotting throughout the body. The tendency to
clot too much is called ‘‘hypercoagulation’’. Anytime
clots form inside blood vessels, they can lead to serious
complications.
The formation of a clot in a blood vessels may be
called thrombophlebitis. The term refers to swelling of
one or more veins caused by a blood clot. Although
some clots occur in the arms or small, surface blood
vessels, most occur in the lower legs. When the blood
clot occurs in a deep vein, it is called deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. As many as one of every 1,000
Americans develops DVT each year. The danger of
DVT comes when pieces of the clot, known as emboli,
break off and travel through the bloodstream to an
artery.
A blood clot that blocks an artery to the brain can
cause a stroke. If the clot blocks blood flow to the
lungs pulmonary embolism can occur. A blood clot
that blocks a coronary artery can cause a heart attack.
Certain people are at higher risk for blood clots than
others; surgery, some injuries, childbirth and lying or
sitting still for extended periods of time put people at
higher risk, as do inherited disorders. Once a person
has a blood clot, he or she may have to take bloodthinning drugs to prevent clots from recurring. Men

and women are at similar risk for blood clots. A recent
study in Austria found that men run a higher risk of
recurring blood clots than women, though the reason
is unknown.

Causes and symptoms
Many causes can lead to blood clots, some
genetic and some environmental. An environmental
cause of DVT is prolonged inactivity. For instance,
having to sit in a car or airplane for a long period of
time decreases blood flow in the lower legs. Recent
studies have shown that 1% of air travelers develop
blood clots, usually on long flights of five hours or
more. However, one study in 2004 found that air
travelers developed clots on flights as short as three
hours, though they often dissolved naturally and did
not lead to complications. Other environmental
causes of blood clots include use of hormone replacement therapy to ease menopausal symptoms, oral
contraceptives for birth control, pregnancy (and a
childbirth within the past six weeks), recent surgery
or procedures involving use of a central venous
access catheter, and cancer. Smoking also is an
important and preventable environmental risk for
blood clots.
Some people are born with a higher risk for blood
clots. Hypercoagulation disorders are genetic conditions. Usually the body doesn t produce enough of
the proteins involved in the clotting process, so they
cannot do their job to stop the clotting; in other cases,
they have an extra protein that causes too much
clotting.

may indicate stroke, heart attack, or pulmonary
embolism, it is advised to go to an emergency room
immediately.

Diagnosis
A physician will diagnose blood clots based on
patient history and one of several diagnostic imaging
exams. The patient’s history will help determine possible risk factors that may lead to suspected blood
clots. In addition to family history or known genetic
disorders, the patient may mention an environmental
factor such as recent air travel or use of high-risk
mediations.
To help get a picture of suspected clots inside the
veins, the first test chosen normally is an ultrasound.
Doppler or duplex ultrasound uses sound waves that
travel through tissue and reflect back. A computer
transforms the sound waves into moving images on
the screen that may show the clot, as well as blood flow
near the clot and any abnormalities. Ultrasound does
not use x rays and is a noninvasive method. Computed
tomography (CT) scans also might be used to image
the blood vessels. It is similar to x rays, except the
images are much like cross-section slices with greater
detail that can be computerized and even viewed threedimensionally. A special dye called a contrast agent
may be injected before the exam to help highlight the
veins. Magnetic resonance angiography uses magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) to image the blood vessels.
It also may involve injection of a contrast dye.
Venography is less commonly used, but involves injecting a contrast and using x rays to image the vein.

Treatment
Medicines can help thin blood, making it less
likely to clot. The two most common blood thinners are heparin and warfarin. Heparin works
right away, keeping blood clots from growing. It
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

usually is injected. In recent years, more physicians have been prescribing low-molecular weight
heparin, purified versions of the drug that can be
given with less monitoring. Warfarin (coumadin)
often is used for long-term treatment of blood
clots and is taken orally. Patients must work closely with their physicians to constantly monitor its
effects and adjust dose if necessary. Too little
warfarin can lead to clotting, but too much can
thin the blood so much that causing life-threatening bleeding can occur. The same can be true of
low-molecular weight heparin when used on a
long-term, at-home basis.
Other treatments for blood clots include injecting
clot busting drugs directly into the clot through a
catheter, or in rare instances, installation of a filter to
block a clot from lodging in the lungs. Sometimes,
surgery also is needed to remove a clot blocking a
pelvic or abdominal vein or one that is chronic and
disabling. A cardiovascular surgeon or interventional
radiologist may perform balloon angioplasty or insert
a stent to open a narrowed or damaged vein. In an
emergency situation, a drug called tissue plasminogen
activator, or tPA, may be given to immediately dissolve a life-threatening blood clot to the brain or heart.
In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approved a new, small, corklike device that can be
used to remove blood clots from the brains of patients
who cannot receive clot-busting drugs.

Alternative treatment
Garlic is thought to lower blood clotting potential. Less evidence suggests onions and cayenne pepper
may help keep blood thin. New research from
Australia adds tomato juice to the list of potential
blood thinners. Subjects who drank a glass of tomato
juice a day reduced their risk for DVT, stroke and
cardiovascular disease. Research has shown that a
natural soy and pine product called pinokinase has
been effective in controlling DVT in air travelers.
Patients seeking alternative treatments for blood
clots should work with certified practitioners and
should inform their allopathic provider about their
alternative care.

Prognosis
If detected and controlled with medications,
blood clots can be safely managed. However, if the
clots become dislodged and travel to an artery, they
can cause nearly instant death. For instance, more
than 600,000 people have a pulmonary embolism
each year and more than 10% of them die from the
579

Blood clots

There may be no symptoms of blood clots until
they grow so large that they block the flow of blood
through the vein. Then, symptoms may develop suddenly around the area and include:

Blood count

embolism, most of them within 30 to 60 minutes after
symptoms start.

Definition

Prevention
Clots may be avoided by not smoking, and by not
using medications that add to the risk. Clotting can be
prevented by following physician recommendations
concerning medications. Sometimes, physicians will
prescribe special support stockings that prevent swelling and reduce chances of DVT. When taking an air
flight of six hours or longer, drinking plenty of fluids
to avoid dehydration, avoiding tight clothing around
the waist, and stretching calves every hour can help
prevent DVT. It is advised that those on long flights
get up and move about once an hour during the flight.
If not possible, moving the legs regularly while seated
by flexing the ankles, then pressing the feet against the
seat in the row ahead or on the floor can help stretch
the calves. A physician may advise those at high risk of
DVT wear support stockings during the flight or take
low-molecular weight heparin two to four hours
before departure.

PERIODICALS

One of the most commonly ordered clinical
laboratory tests, a blood count, also called a complete blood count (CBC), is a basic evaluation of
the cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) suspended in the liquid part of the blood
(plasma). It involves determining the numbers, concentrations, and conditions of the different types of
blood cells.

Purpose
The CBC is a useful screening and diagnostic test
that is often done as part of a routine physical examination. It can provide valuable information about the
blood and blood-forming tissues (especially the bone
marrow), as well as other body systems. Abnormal
results can indicate the presence of a variety of conditions—including anemias, leukemias, and infections—
sometimes before the patient experiences symptoms of
the disease.

I Blood count

A complete blood count is actually a series of tests
in which the numbers of red blood cells, white blood
cells, and platelets in a given volume of blood are
counted. The CBC also measures the hemoglobin content and the packed cell volume (hematocrit) of the red
blood cells, assesses the size and shape of the red blood
cells, and determines the types and percentages of
white blood cells. Components of the complete blood
count (hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cells,
platelets, etc.) can also be tested separately, and are
sometimes done that way when a doctor wants to
monitor a specific condition, such as the white cell
count of a patient diagnosed with leukemia, or the
hemoglobin of a patient who has recently received a
blood transfusion. Because of its value, though, as an
indicator of a person’s overall health, the CBC package is most frequently ordered.
The blood count is performed relatively inexpensively and quickly. Most laboratories routinely use
some type of automated equipment to dilute the
blood, sample a measured volume of the diluted suspension, and count the cells in that volume. In addition to counting actual numbers of red cells, white
cells, and platelets, the automated cell counters also
measure the hemoglobin and calculate the hematocrit
and the red blood cell indices (measures of the size and
hemoglobin content of the red blood cells).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

NYC. Reproduced by permission.)

Technologists then examine a stained blood smear
under the microscope to identify any abnormalities
in the appearance of the red blood cells and to report
the types and percentages of white blood cells
observed.
The red blood cell (RBC) count determines the
total number of red cells (erythrocytes) in a sample of
blood. The red cells, the most numerous of the cellular elements, carry oxygen from the lungs to the
body’s tissues. Hemoglobin (Hgb) is the proteiniron compound in the red blood cells that enables
them to transport oxygen. Its concentration corresponds closely to the RBC count. Also closely tied
to the RBC and hemoglobin values is the hematocrit
(Hct), which measures the percentage of red blood
cells in the total blood volume. The hematocrit
(expressed as percentage points) is normally about
three times the hemoglobin concentration (reported
as grams per deciliter).
Red blood cell indices provide information
about the size and hemoglobin content of the red
cells. They are useful in differentiating types of anemias. The indices include four measurements that are
calculated using the RBC count, hemoglobin, and
hematocrit results. Mean corpuscular volume
(MCV) is a measurement of the average size of the
red blood cells and indicates whether that is small,
large or normal. The red blood cell distribution width
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The white blood cell (WBC) count determines the
total number of white cells (leukocytes) in the blood
sample. Fewer in number than the red cells, WBCs
are the body’s primary means of fighting infection.
There are five main types of white cells (neutrophils,
lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils), each of which plays a different role in responding to the presence of foreign organisms in the body.
A differential white cell count is done by staining a
smear of the patient’s blood with a Wright’s stain,
allowing the different types of white cells to be clearly
seen under the microscope. A technologist then
counts a minimum of 100 WBCs and reports each
type of white cell as a percentage of the total white
blood cells counted.
The platelet count is an actual count of the number
of platelets (thrombocytes) in a given volume of blood.
Platelets, the smallest of the cellular elements of blood,
are involved in blood clotting. Because platelets
can clump together, the automated counting method
is subject to a certain level of error and may not
be accurate enough for low platelet counts. For this
reason, very low platelet levels are often counted
manually.

Normal results
Blood count values can vary by age and sex. The
normal red blood cell count ranges from 4.2–5.4 million RBCs per microliter of blood for men and 3.6–5.0
million for women. Hemoglobin values range
from 14–18 grams per deciliter of blood for men and
12–16 grams for women. The normal hematocrit is
42–54% for men and 36–48% for women. The normal
number of white blood cells for both men and women
is approximately 4,000–10,000 WBCs per microliter of
blood.

Abnormal results
Abnormal blood count results are seen in a variety of conditions. One of the most common is anemias, which are characterized by low RBC counts,
hemoglobins, and hematocrits. Infections and leukemias are associated with increased numbers of
WBCs.
581

Blood count

(RDW) is an indication of the variation in RBC size.
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) measures the
average amount (weight) of hemoglobin within a red
blood cell. A similar measurement, mean corpuscular
hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), expresses the
average concentration of hemoglobin in the red
blood cells.

I Blood culture
Definition
A blood culture is done when a person has symptoms of a blood infection, also called bacteremia.
Blood is drawn from the person one or more times
and is tested in a laboratory to find and identify any
microorganism present and growing in the blood. If a
microorganism is found, more testing is done to determine the antibiotics that will be effective in treating the
infection.

Purpose
Bacteremia is a serious clinical condition and can
lead to death. To give the best chance for effective
treatment and survival, a blood culture is done as
soon as an infection is suspected.
Symptoms of bacteremia are fever, chills, mental
confusion, anxiety, rapid heart beat, hyperventilation,
blood clotting problems, and shock. These symptoms
are especially significant in a person who already has
another illness or infection, is hospitalized, or has
trouble fighting infections because of a weak immune
system. Often, the blood infection results from an
infection somewhere else in the body that has now
spread.
Additionally, blood cultures are done to find the
causes of other infections. These include bacterial
pneumonia (an infection of the lung), and infectious
endocarditis (an infection of the inner layer of the
heart). Both of these infections leak bacteria into the
blood.
After a blood infection has been diagnosed, confirmed by culture, and treated, an additional blood

intervals.

culture may be done to make sure the infection is
gone.

Description
Culture strategies
There are many variables involved in performing
a blood culture. Before the person’s blood is drawn,
the physician must make several decisions based on a
knowledge of infections and the person’s clinical condition and medical history.
Several groups of microorganisms, including
bacteria, viruses, mold, and yeast, can cause blood
infections. The bacteria group can be further broken
down into aerobes and anaerobes. Most aerobes do
not need oxygen to live. They can grow with oxygen
(aerobic microbes) or without oxygen (anaerobic
microbes).
Based on the clinical condition of the patient, the
physician determines what group of microorganisms
is likely to be causing the infection and then orders
one or more specific types of blood culture, including
aerobic, anaerobic, viral, or fungal (for yeasts and
molds). Each specific type of culture is handled differently by the laboratory. Most blood cultures test for
both aerobic and anaerobic microbes. Fungal, viral,
and mycobacterial blood cultures can also be done,
but are less common.
The physician must also decide how many blood
cultures should be done. One culture is rarely
enough, but two to three are usually adequate.
Four cultures are occasionally required. Some factors influencing this decision are the specific microorganisms the physician expects to find based on the
person’s symptoms or previous culture results, and

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The time at which the cultures are to be drawn is
another decision made by the physician. During
most blood infections (called intermittent bacteremia) microorganisms enter the blood at various
time intervals. Blood drawn randomly may miss the
microorganisms. Since microorganisms enter the
blood 30–90 minutes before the person’s fever
spikes, collecting the culture just after the fever
spike offers the best likelihood of finding the microorganism. The second and third cultures may be
collected at the same time, but from different places
on the person, or spaced at 30-minute or one-hour
intervals, as the physician chooses. During continuous bacteremia, such as infective endocarditis,
microorganisms are always in the blood and the
timing of culture collection is less important. Blood
cultures should always be collected before antibiotic
treatment has begun.
Laboratory analysis
Bacteria are the most common microorganisms
found in blood infections. Laboratory analysis of a
bacterial blood culture differs slightly from that of a
fungal culture and significantly from that of a viral
culture.
Blood is drawn from a person and put directly
into a blood culture bottle containing a nutritional
broth. After the laboratory receives the blood culture
bottle, several processes must be completed:


provide an environment for the bacteria to grow



detect the growth when it occurs



identify the bacteria that grow



test the bacteria against certain antibiotics to determine which antibiotic will be effective

There are several types of systems, both manual
and automated, available to laboratories to carry out
these processes.
The broth in the blood culture bottle is the first
step in creating an environment in which bacteria will
grow. It contains all the nutrients that bacteria need to
grow. If the physician expects anaerobic bacteria to
grow, oxygen will be kept out of the blood culture
bottle; if aerobes are expected, oxygen will be allowed
in the bottle.
The bottles are placed in an incubator and kept at
body temperature. They are watched daily for signs of
growth, including cloudiness or a color change in the

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

broth, gas bubbles, or clumps of bacteria. When there
is evidence of growth, the laboratory does a gram stain
and a subculture. To do the gram stain, a drop of
blood is removed from the bottle and placed on a
microscope slide. The blood is allowed to dry and
then is stained with purple and red stains and examined under the microscope. If bacteria are seen, the
color of stain they picked up (purple or red), their
shape (such as round or rectangular), and their size
provide valuable clues as to what type of microorganism they are and what antibiotics might work best. To
do the subculture, a drop of blood is placed on a
culture plate, spread over the surface, and placed in
an incubator.
If there is no immediate visible evidence of growth
in the bottles, the laboratory looks for bacteria by
doing gram stains and subcultures. These steps are
repeated daily for the first several days and periodically after that.
When bacteria grows, the laboratory identifies it
using biochemical tests and the gram stain. Sensitivity
testing, also called antibiotic susceptibility testing, is
also done. The bacteria are tested against many different antibiotics to see which antibiotics can effectively
kill it.
All information is passed on to the physician as
soon as it is known. An early report, known as a
preliminary report, is usually available after one day.
This report will tell if any bacteria have been found
yet, and if so, the results of the gram stain. The next
preliminary report may include a description of the
bacteria growing on the subculture. The laboratory
notifies the physician immediately when an organism
is found and as soon as sensitivity tests are complete.
Sensitivity tests may be complete before the bacteria
is completely identified. The final report may not be
available for five to seven days. If bacteria was
found, the report will include its complete identification and a list of the antibiotics to which the bacteria is
sensitive.
One automated system is considered one of
the most important recent technical advances in
blood cultures. It is called continuous-monitoring
blood culture systems (CMCCS). The instruments
automatically monitor the bottles containing the
patient blood for evidence of microorganisms, usually
every 10 minutes. Many data points are collected daily
for each bottle, and fed into a computer for analysis.
Sophisticated mathematical calculations can determine when microorganisms have grown. This, combined with more frequent blood tests, make it possible

to detect microbial growth earlier. In addition, all
CMBCS instruments have the detection system, incubator, and agitation unit in one unit.

Preparation
Ten ml (milliliter) of blood is usually needed for
each blood culture bottle. First a healthcare worker
locates a vein in the inner elbow region. The area of
skin where the blood will be drawn must be disinfected to prevent any microorganisms on a person’s
skin from entering the blood culture bottle and contaminating it. The area is disinfected by wiping the
area with alcohol in a circular fashion, starting with
tiny circles at the spot where the needle will puncture
the skin and enlarging the size of the circles while
wiping away from the puncture site. The same
pattern of wiping is repeated using an iodine or iodophor solution. The top of the bottle is disinfected
using alcohol. After the person’s skin has been
disinfected, the healthcare worker draws the blood
and about 10 ml of blood is injected into each
blood culture bottle. The type of bottles used will
vary based on whether the physician is looking
for bacteria (aerobes or anaerobes), yeast, mold, or
viruses.

consistent with a blood infection caused by the microorganism that was found. The microorganism is
usually found in more than one culture, it usually
grows soon after the bottles are incubated, and it is
often the cause of an infection somewhere else in the
person’s body.
When the culture is positive because of contamination, the patient’s clinical condition usually is not
consistent with an infection from the identified
microorganism. In addition, the microorganism is
often one commonly found on skin, it rarely causes
infection, it is found in only one bottle, and it may
appear after several days of incubation. More than
one microorganism often grow in contaminated
cultures.

Aftercare
Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture
site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to
the puncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising. Warm packs relieve discomfort.

Normal results
Normal results will be negative. A single negative
culture does not rule out a blood infection. False
negatives can occur if the person was started on
antibiotics before the blood was drawn, if the
environment for growth was not right, the timing
was off, or for some unknown reason the microorganism just didn’t grow. Three negative cultures
may be enough to rule out bacteremia in the case of
endocarditis.

Abnormal results
The physician’s skill in interpreting the culture
results and assessing the person’s clinical condition is
essential in distinguishing a blood culture that is positive because of a true infection from a culture that is
positive because it became contaminated. In true
bacteremia, the patient’s clinical condition should be

I Blood donation and registry
Definition
Blood donation refers to the process of collecting,
testing, preparing, and storing blood and blood components. Donors are most commonly unpaid volunteers, but they may also be paid by commercial
enterprises. Blood registry refers to the collection and
sharing of data about donated blood and ineligible
donors.

Purpose
The purpose of the blood collection and distribution system is to help ensure an adequate supply of
blood for accident victims, people needing surgery,
and people suffering from certain diseases, as well as
for medical research.
Sometimes, donors give blood specifically to
benefit a particular person. People preparing for elective surgery may donate their own blood to be held
and then returned to them during surgery. This is
known as autologous blood donation. Directed
donor blood has been donated by someone known

to the intended recipient, such as a family member or
friend.
Each year, more than four million Americans
receive blood transfusions involving more than
26 million units of blood (one unit equals 450 milliliters, or about one pint), or an average of about
32,000 units per day. All of that blood must be
collected, tested, prepared, stored, and delivered
to the appropriate sites. Roughly eight million
people in the United States donate blood each year;
about half of the total amount needed is provided
by the 36 regional blood centers of the American
Red Cross.
Whole blood and the various blood components
have many uses. Red blood cells, which carry oxygen,
are used to treat anemia. Platelets, which play a role in
controlling bleeding, are commonly used in the treatment of leukemia and other cancers. Fresh frozen
plasma is also used to control bleeding in people deficient in certain clotting factors. Cryoprecipitated
AHF, made from fresh frozen plasma, contains a few
specific clotting factors.

Precautions
To ensure the safety of the blood supply, a multitiered process of donor screening and deferral is
employed. This involves donor education, taking a
detailed health history of each prospective donor, and
giving potential donors a simple physical examination
(which includes taking a few drops of blood to test for
anemia). At any point in the process, a potential donor
may be ‘‘deferred,’’ or judged ineligible to donate blood.
This deferral may be temporary or permanent, depending on the reason. Potential donors are also encouraged
to ‘‘self-defer,’’ or voluntarily decline to donate, rather
than put future blood recipients at risk.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

All donated blood is extensively tested before
being used. The first step is determining the blood
type, which indicates who can receive the blood.
Receiving the wrong type of blood can cause
death. Blood is also screened for any antibodies that
could cause complications for recipients. In addition,
blood is tested to screen out donors infected with
the following diseases: Hepatitis B surface antigen
ADD, hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis C
virus antibody, HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody, HIV p24
antigen, HTLV-I and HTLV-II antibodies, and
syphilis. Nucleic Acid Amplification testing is also
performed, and other tests may be done if a doctor
requests them.
In order to detect the greatest possible number of
infections, these screening tests are extremely sensitive. For this reason, however, donors sometimes
receive false positive test results. In these cases,
more specific confirmatory tests are performed, to
help rule out false positive results. Blood found to
be abnormal is discarded, and all items coming into
direct contact with donors are used only once and
then discarded. Donors of infected blood are entered
into the Donor Deferral Register, a confidential
national data base used to prevent deferred people
from donating blood.
In general, blood donors must be at least 17 years
old (some states allow younger people to donate blood
with their parents’ consent), must weigh at least 110
pounds (50 kg), and must be in good health.
Many factors can temporarily or permanently
disqualify potential donors. Most of them have to
do with having engaged in behaviors that put them
at risk of infection or having spent time in certain
specified areas. Among these factors are having had a
tattoo, having had sex with people in high-risk
groups, having had certain diseases, and having
been raped.

Description
There are eight different blood types in all—four
ABO groups, each of which may be either Rh positive
or Rh negative. These types, and their approximate
distribution in the U.S. population, are as follows:
O+ (38%), O- (7%), A+ (34%), A- (6%), B+ (9%),
B- (2%), AB+ (3%), AB- (1%). In an emergency,
anyone can safely receive type O red blood cells,
and people with this blood type are known as
‘‘universal donors.’’ People with type AB blood,
known as ‘‘universal recipients,’’ can receive any type
of red blood cells and can give plasma to all blood
types.
585

Blood donation and registry

KEY TERMS

Blood donation and registry

Blood donations can be made in community
blood centers, at hospitals or in bloodmobiles, which
visit schools, churches and workplaces. The actual
process of donating whole blood takes about 20
minutes. A sterile needle is inserted into a vein in the
donor’s arm. The blood flows through plastic tubing
into a blood bag. Donors may be asked to clench their
fist to encourage blood to flow. Usually, one unit of
blood is collected. Afterward, donors are escorted to
an observation area, given light refreshments, and
allowed to rest.

screening tests, the transmission of infectious diseases via transfusion has been significantly diminished. Nonetheless, there is still a minuscule risk
that blood recipients could contract HIV, Hepatitis
C or other infections via transfusion. Other diseases
that could conceivably be contracted in this way, or
that are of particular concern to blood-collection
agencies, include babesiosis, Chagas disease, HTLVI and -II, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, cytomegalovirus, Lyme disease, malaria, and new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

Plasma, the liquid portion of the blood in which red
blood cells, platelets and other elements are suspended,
is also collected, often by commercial enterprises that
sell it to companies manufacturing clotting factors and
other blood products. This is done using a process
known as apheresis, in which whole blood is collected, the desired blood component is removed, and
the remainder is returned to the donor. Collecting
plasma generally takes one to two hours. Apheresis
may also be used to collect other blood components,
such as platelets and granulocytes.

Autologous blood donors run a tiny risk of having
the wrong blood returned to them due to clerical error.
There is also a faint possibility of bacterial contamination of the autologous blood.

Preparation
Once whole blood has been collected, it is sent to a
lab for testing and processing. Most donated blood is
separated into its constituent components, such as red
blood cells, platelets, and cryoprecipitate. This enables
more than one person to benefit from the same unit of
donated blood.
Different blood components vary in how long
they can be stored. Red blood cells can be refrigerated
for up to 42 days or frozen for as much as 10 years.
Platelets, stored at room temperature, may be kept for
up to five days. Fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitated AHF can be kept for as much as one year.

Aftercare
It generally takes about 24 hours for the donor’s
body to replenish the lost fluid. Replacing the lost red
blood cells, however, may take as much as two
months. Whole blood donors must wait a minimum
of eight weeks before donating again. Some states
place further limits on the frequency and/or total
number of times an individual may donate blood
within a 12-month period.

Risks
Thanks to the use of a multi-tiered screening
system and advances in the effectiveness of
586

Normal results
For most donors, the process is quick and painless
and they leave feeling fine. They may also find satisfaction in knowing that they have contributed to the
nation’s blood supply and may even have helped save
lives.

Abnormal results
Most blood donors suffer no significant aftereffects. Occasionally, however, donors feel faint or
dizzy, nauseous, and/or have pain, redness, or a bruise
where the blood was taken. More serious complications, which rarely occur, include fainting, muscle
spasms, and nerve damage.

Blood gas analysis

I Blood gas analysis
Definition
Blood gas analysis, also called arterial blood gas
(ABG) analysis, is a test which measures the amounts
of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood, as well as
the acidity (pH) of the blood.

Purpose
An ABG analysis evaluates how effectively the
lungs are delivering oxygen to the blood and how
efficiently they are eliminating carbon dioxide from
it. The test also indicates how well the lungs and
kidneys are interacting to maintain normal blood pH
(acid-base balance). Blood gas studies are usually
done to assess respiratory disease and other conditions
that may affect the lungs, and to manage patients
receiving oxygen therapy (respiratory therapy). In
addition, the acid-base component of the test provides
information on kidney function.

Description
Blood gas analysis is performed on blood from an
artery. It measures the partial pressures of oxygen and
carbon dioxide in the blood, as well as oxygen content,
oxygen saturation, bicarbonate content, and blood pH.
Oxygen in the lungs is carried to the tissues through
the bloodstream, but only a small amount of this oxygen can actually dissolve in arterial blood. How much
dissolves depends on the partial pressure of the oxygen
(the pressure that the gas exerts on the walls of the
arteries). Therefore, testing the partial pressure of oxygen is actually measuring how much oxygen the lungs
are delivering to the blood. Carbon dioxide is released
into the blood as a by-product of cell metabolism. The
partial carbon dioxide pressure indicates how well the
lungs are eliminating this carbon dioxide.
The remainder of oxygen that is not dissolved in
the blood combines with hemoglobin, a protein–iron
compound found in the red blood cells. The oxygen
content measurement in an ABG analysis indicates
how much oxygen is combined with the hemoglobin.
A related value is the oxygen saturation, which compares the amount of oxygen actually combined with
hemoglobin to the total amount of oxygen that the
hemoglobin is capable of combining with.
Carbon dioxide dissolves more readily in the blood
than oxygen does, primarily forming bicarbonate and
smaller amounts of carbonic acid. When present in

KEY TERMS
Acid-base balance—The condition that exists
when the body’s carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer
system is in equilibrium, helping to maintain the
blood pH at a normal level of 7.35–7.45.

functions are most efficient. The lungs and kidneys

Blood sugar tests

both participate in maintaining the carbonic acidbicarbonate balance. The lungs control the carbonic
acid level and the kidneys regulate the bicarbonate. If
either organ is not functioning properly, an acid-base
imbalance can result. Determination of bicarbonate
and pH levels, then, aids in diagnosing the cause of
abnormal blood gas values.
The procedure
The blood sample is obtained by arterial puncture
(usually in the wrist, although it could be in the groin
or arm) or from an arterial line already in place. If a
puncture is needed, the skin over the artery is cleaned
with an antiseptic. A technician then collects the blood
with a small sterile needle attached to a disposable
syringe. The patient may feel a brief throbbing or
cramping at the site of the puncture. After the blood
is drawn, the sample must be transported to the
laboratory as soon as possible for analysis.



oxygen content (O2CT): 15–23%



oxygen saturation (SaO2): 94–100%



bicarbonate (HCO3): 22–26 mEq/liter

pH: 7.35–7.45

Abnormal results
Values that differ from those listed above may
indicate respiratory, metabolic, or kidney disease.
These results also may be abnormal if the patient
has experienced trauma that may affect breathing
(especially head and neck injuries). Disorders, such
as anemia, that affect the oxygen-carrying capacity
of blood, can produce an abnormally low oxygen
content value.

Preparation
There are no special preparations. Patients have no
restrictions on drinking or eating before the test. If the
patient is receiving oxygen, the oxygen concentration
must remain the same for 20 minutes before the test; if
the test is to be taken without oxygen, the gas must be
turned off for 20 minutes before the test is taken. The
patient should breathe normally during the test.

Aftercare
After the blood has been taken, the technician
or the patient applies pressure to the puncture site
for 10–15 minutes to stop the bleeding, and then places
a dressing over the puncture.The patient should rest
quietly while applying the pressure to the puncture
site. Health care workers will observe the patient for
signs of bleeding or circulation problems

Risks
Risks are very low when the test is done correctly.
Risks include bleeding or bruising at the site, or delayed
bleeding from the site. Very rarely, there may be a
problem with circulation in the puncture area.

I Blood sugar tests
Definition
Blood sugar tests include several different tests
that measure the amount of sugar (glucose) in a person’s blood. These tests are performed either on an
empty stomach, or after consuming a meal or premeasured glucose drink. Blood sugar tests are done
primarily to diagnose and evaluate a person with
diabetes mellitus.

Purpose
The body uses sugar, also called glucose, to supply
the energy it needs to function. People get sugar from
their diet and from their body tissues. Insulin is made
by the pancreas and affects the outer membrane of
cells, making it easy for glucose to move from the
blood into the cells. When insulin is active, blood
glucose levels fall. Sugar from body tissues is stored
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

After a meal, blood glucose levels rise sharply.
The pancreas responds by releasing enough insulin to
take care of all the newly added sugar found in the
body. The insulin moves the sugar out of the blood
and into the cells. Only then does the blood sugar start
to level off and begin to fall. A person with diabetes
mellitus either does not make enough insulin, or
makes insulin that does not work properly. The result
is blood sugar that remains high, a condition called
hyperglycemia.
Diabetes must be diagnosed as early as possible. If
left untreated, it can damage or cause failure of the
eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, blood vessels, and other
body organs. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, also
may be discovered through blood sugar testing.
Hypoglycemia is caused by various hormone disorders
and liver disease, as well as by too much insulin.

Description
There are a variety of ways to measure a person’s
blood sugar.
Whole blood glucose test
Whole blood glucose testing can be performed by
a person in his or her home, and kits are available for
this purpose. The person pricks his or her finger (a
finger stick) with a sterile sharp blade from the kit. A
single drop of blood is placed on a strip in a portable
instrument called a glucometer. The glucometer
quickly determines the blood sugar and shows the
results on a small screen in usually a few seconds.
New technologies for monitoring glucose levels
will help diabetics better control their glucose levels.
These tests are particularly important for children
and adolescents. In mid-2002, the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new home
test for use by children and adolescents (it had
already been approved for adults) called the Cygnus
GlucoWatch biographer that helped better detect
hypoglycemia. Studies show that more frequent
checks are better; new monitors such as this allow
for simpler frequent testing. Continuous monitoring
was in development in early 2004, as a company
called TheraSense, Inc. received preapproval from
the FDA for clinical trials on its home continuous
glucose monitor. The monitor was designed to provide users with real-time glucose data, alarms for
hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and to show trends
in their blood sugar levels.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Fasting plasma glucose test
The fasting plasma glucose test is done on an
empty stomach. For the eight hours before the test,
the person must fast (nothing to eat or drink, except
water). The person’s blood is drawn from a vein by a
health care worker. The blood sample is collected into
a tube containing an anticoagulant. Anticoagulants
stop the blood from clotting. In the laboratory, the
tube of blood spins at high speed within a machine
called a centrifuge. The blood cells sink to the bottom
and the liquid stays on the top. This straw-colored
liquid on the top is the plasma. To measure the
glucose, a person’s plasma is combined with other
substances. From the resulting reaction, the amount
of glucose in the plasma is determined.
Oral glucose tolerance test
The oral glucose tolerance test is conducted to see
how well the body handles a standard amount of
glucose. This test measures the amount of glucose in
a person’s plasma before and two hours after drinking
a large premeasured beverage containing glucose. The
person must eat a consistent diet, containing at least
5.25 oz (150g) of carbohydrates each day, for three
days before this test. For eight hours before the test,
the person must fast. A health care provider draws the
first sample of blood at the end of the fast to determine
the glucose level at the start of the test. The health care
provider then gives the person a beverage containing
2.6oz (75g) of glucose. Two hours later, the person’s
blood is drawn again. These blood samples are centrifuged and processed in the laboratory. A doctor can
then compare the before and after glucose levels to see
how well the patient’s body processed the sugar.
Two-hour postprandial blood glucose test
The two-hour postprandial blood glucose test measures the amount of glucose in plasma after a person eats
a specific meal containing a certain amount of sugar.
Although the meal follows a predetermined menu, it is
difficult to control many factors associated with this
testing method.
Blood sugar tests can be used in a variety of situations including:


Testing people suspected for diabetes. The American
Diabetic Association (ADA) recommends that either
a fasting plasma glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance test be used to diagnose diabetes. If the person
already has symptoms of diabetes, a blood glucose test
without fasting (called a casual plasma glucose test)
may be done. If the test result is abnormal, it must be
confirmed with another test performed on another
589

Blood sugar tests

in the form of glycogen. When glycogen is active,
blood glucose levels rise.

Blood sugar tests

day. The two tests can be different or they can be the
same, but they must be done on different days. If the
second test also is abnormal, the person has diabetes.
A two-hour postprandial test is not recommended by
the ADA as a test to use for the diagnosis of diabetes.
A doctor may order this test, and follow it with the
oral glucose tolerance test or the fasting plasma glucose test if the results are abnormal.






Testing pregnant women. Diabetes that occurs during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) is dangerous for
both the mother and the baby. Women who may be
at risk are screened when they are 24-28 weeks pregnant. A woman is considered at risk if she is older
than 25 years, is not at her normal body weight, has a
parent or sibling with diabetes, or if she is in an ethnic
group that has a high rate of diabetes (Hispanics,
Native Americans, Asians, African Americans).
The blood sugar test to screen for gestational diabetes is a variation of the oral glucose tolerance test.
Fasting is not required. If the result is abnormal,
a more complete test is done on another day.
Testing healthy people. Healthy people without
symptoms of diabetes should be screened for diabetes when they are 45 years old and again every
three years. Either the fasting plasma glucose or
oral glucose tolerance test is used for screening.
People in high risk groups should be tested before
the age of 45 and tested more frequently.
Testing of people already diagnosed with diabetes.
The ADA recommends that a person with diabetes
keep the amount of glucose in the blood at a normal
level as much as possible. This can be done by the
diabetic person testing his or her own blood at home
one or more times a day.

Preparation
Each blood sugar test that uses plasma requires a
5 mL blood sample. A healthcare worker ties a tight
band (tourniquet) on the person’s upper arm, locates a
vein in the inner elbow region, and inserts a needle into
the vein. Vacuum action draws the blood through the
needle into an attached tube. Collection of the sample
takes only a few minutes.
When fasting is required, the person should have
nothing to eat or drink (except water) for eight hours
before the test and until the test or series of tests is
completed. The person should not smoke before or
during the testing period because this can temporarily
increase the amount of glucose in the blood. Other
factors that can cause inaccurate results are a change
in diet before the test, illness or surgery two weeks
590

before the test, certain drugs, and extended bed rest.
The doctor may tell a person on insulin or taking pills
for diabetes to stop the medication until after the test.

Aftercare
After the test or series of tests is completed (and
with the approval of his or her doctor), the person
should eat, drink, and take any medications that
were stopped for the test.
The patient may feel discomfort when blood is
drawn from a vein. Bruising may occur at the puncture
site or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to
the puncture site until the bleeding stops will reduce
bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve
discomfort.

Risks
If the person experiences weakness, fainting,
sweating, or any other unusual reaction while fasting
or during the test, he or she should immediately tell the
person giving the test.

Normal results
Normal results are:


fasting plasma glucose test less than 120 mg/dL



oral glucose tolerance test, 2 hours less than 140 mg/dL

For the diabetic person, the ADA recommends
an ongoing blood sugar goal of less than or equal to
120 mg/dL.

Abnormal results
These abnormal results indicate diabetes and
must be confirmed with repeat testing:


fasting plasma glucose test less than or equal to
126 mg/dL



oral glucose tolerance test, 2 hours less than or equal
to 200 mg/dL



casual plasma glucose test (nonfasting, with symptoms) less than or equal to 200 mg/dL



gestational oral glucose tolerance test, 1 hour less
than or equal to 140 mg/dL

Brain damage can occur from glucose levels below
40 mg/dL and coma from levels above 470 mg/dL.
A condition known as prediabetes or impaired
glucose tolerance, which may lead to Type 2 diabetes,
usually is indicated with a reading of 100 mg/dL. Other
hormone disorders can cause both hyperglycemia and

typing and
I Blood
crossmatching
Definition
Blood typing is a laboratory test done to determine a person’s blood type. If the person needs a blood
transfusion, another test called crossmatching is done
after the blood is typed to find blood from a donor
that the person’s body will accept.

Purpose
Blood typing and crossmatching are most commonly done to make certain that a person who needs a
transfusion will receive blood that matches (is compatible with) his own. People must receive blood of the
same blood type, otherwise, a serious, even fatal,
transfusion reaction can occur.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Parents who are expecting a baby have their blood
typed to diagnose and prevent hemolytic disease of the
newborn (HDN), a type of anemia also known as
erythroblastosis fetalis. Babies who have a blood type
different from their mothers are at risk for developing
this disease. The disease is serious with certain blood
type differences, but is milder with others.
A child inherits factors or genes from each parent
that determine his blood type. This fact makes blood
typing useful in paternity testing. To determine
whether or not the alleged father could be the true
father, the blood types of the child, mother, and
alleged father are compared.
Legal investigations may require typing of blood
or other body fluids, such as semen or saliva, to identify persons involved in crimes or other legal matters.

Description
Blood typing and crossmatching tests are performed in a blood bank laboratory by technologists
trained in blood bank and transfusion services. The
tests are done on blood, after it has separated into cells
and serum (serum is the yellow liquid left after the
blood clots.) Costs for both tests are covered by insurance when the tests are determined to be medically
necessary.
Blood bank laboratories are usually located in
facilities, such as those operated by the American
Red Cross, that collect, process, and supply blood
that is donated, as well as in facilities, such as most
hospitals, that prepare blood for transfusion. These
laboratories are regulated by the United States Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) and are often
inspected and accredited by a professional association
such as the American Association of Blood Banks
(AABB).
Blood typing and crossmatching tests are based
on the reaction between antigens and antibodies. An
antigen can be anything that causes the body to launch
an attack, known as an immune response, against it.
The attack begins when the body builds a special
protein, called an antibody, that is uniquely designed
to attack and make ineffective (neutralize) the specific
antigen that caused the attack. A person’s body normally doesn’t make antibodies against its own antigens, only against antigens that are foreign to it.
A person’s body contains many antigens. The antigens found on the surface of red blood cells are important because they determine a person’s blood type.
When red blood cells having a certain blood type antigen are mixed with serum containing antibodies against

hypoglycemia. Abnormal results must be interpreted by
a doctor who is aware of the person’s medical condition
and medical history.

that antigen, the antibodies attack and stick to the
antigen. In a test tube, this reaction is observed as the
formation of clumps of cells (clumping).
When blood is typed, a person’s cells and serum
are mixed in a test tube with commercially-prepared
serum and cells. Clumping tells which antigens or
antibodies are present and reveals the person’s blood
type. When blood is crossmatched, patient serum
is mixed with cells from donated blood that might be
used for transfusion. Clumping or lack of clumping
in the test tube tells whether or not the blood is
compatible.
Although there are over 600 known red blood cell
antigens, organized into 22 blood group systems, routine blood typing and crossmatching is usually concerned with only two systems: the ABO and Rh blood
group systems.
Blood typing
ABO BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM. In 1901, Karl
Landsteiner, an Austrian pathologist, randomly combined the serum and red blood cells of his colleagues.
From the reactions he observed in test tubes, he discovered the ABO blood group system. This discovery
earned him the 1930 Nobel Prize in Medicine.

A person’s ABO blood type–A, B, AB, or O–is
based on the presence or absence of the A and B
antigens on his red blood cells. The A blood type has
only the A antigen and the B blood type has only the
B antigen. The AB blood type has both A and B
antigens, and the O blood type has neither A nor B
antigen.
By the time a person is six months old, he naturally will have developed antibodies against the antigens his red blood cells lack. That is, a person with A
blood type will have anti-B antibodies, and a person
with B blood type will have anti-A antibodies. A person with AB blood type will have neither antibody, but
a person with O blood type will have both anti-A and
anti-B antibodies. Although the distribution of each of
the four ABO blood types varies between racial

groups, O is the most common and AB is the least
common.
ABO typing is the first test done on blood when it
is tested for transfusion. A person must receive ABOmatched blood. ABO incompatibilities are the major
cause of fatal transfusion reactions. ABO antigens are
also found on most body organs, so ABO compatibility is also important for organ transplants.
An ABO incompatibility between a pregnant
woman and her baby is a minor cause of HDN and
usually causes no problem for the baby. The structure
of ABO antibodies makes it unlikely they will cross the
placenta to attack the baby’s red blood cells.
Paternity testing compares the ABO blood types of
the child, mother, and alleged father. The alleged father
can’t be the true father if the child’s blood type requires
a gene that neither he nor the mother have. For example, a child with blood type B whose mother has blood
type O, requires a father with either AB or B blood type;
a man with blood type O cannot be the true father.
In some people, ABO antigens can be found in
body fluids other than blood, such as saliva and
semen. ABO typing of these fluids provides clues in
legal investigations.
RH BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM. The Rh, or Rhesus,
system was first detected in 1940 by Landsteiner and
Wiener when they injected blood from rhesus monkeys
into guinea pigs and rabbits. More than 50 antigens have
since been discovered belonging to this system, making
it the most complex red blood cell antigen system.

In routine blood typing and crossmatching tests,
only one of these 50 antigens, the D antigen, also
known as the Rh factor or Rho[D], is tested for.
If the D antigen is present, that person is Rh-positive;
if the D antigen is absent, that person is Rh-negative.
Other important antigens in the Rh system are C,
c, E, and e. These antigens are not usually tested for in
routine blood typing tests. However, testing for the
presence of these antigens is useful in paternity testing,
and when a technologist tries to identify unexpected

Illustrators Group.)

Rh antibodies or find matching blood for a person
with antibodies to one or more of these antigens.
Unlike the ABO system, antibodies to Rh antigens don’t develop naturally. They develop only as an
immune response after a transfusion or during
pregnancy.
The incidence of the Rh blood types varies
between racial groups, but not as widely as the ABO
blood types: 85% of whites and 90% of blacks are
Rh-positive; 15% of whites and 10% of blacks are
Rh-negative.
In transfusions, the Rh system is next in importance after the ABO system. Most Rh-negative people
who receive Rh-positive blood will develop anti-D
antibodies. A later transfusion of Rh-positive blood
could result in a severe or fatal transfusion reaction.
Rh incompatibility is the most common and
severe cause of HDN. This incompatibility can
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

happen when an Rh-negative woman and an Rhpositive man produce an Rh-positive baby. Cells
from the baby can cross the placenta and enter the
mother’s bloodstream, causing the mother to make
anti-D antibodies. Unlike ABO antibodies, the structure of anti-D antibodies makes it likely that they will
cross the placenta and enter the baby’s bloodstream.
There, they can destroy the baby’s red blood cells,
causing severe or fatal anemia.
The first step in preventing HDN is to find out
the Rh types of the expectant parents. If the mother is
Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, the baby is
at risk for developing HDN. The next step is to test the
mother’s serum to make sure she doesn’t already have
anti-D antibodies from a previous pregnancy or transfusion. This procedure is similar to blood typing.
Finally, the Rh-negative mother is given an injection
of Rh Immunoglobulin (RhIg) at 28 weeks of gestation and again after delivery, if the baby is Rh positive.

Blood typing and crossmatching

KEY TERMS
ABO blood type—Blood type based on the presence or absence of the A and B antigens on the
red blood cells.
Antibody—A special protein made by the body as a
defense against foreign material that enters the
body. It is uniquely designed to attack and neutralize the specific antigen that triggered the immune
response.
Antigen—Anything that causes the body to launch
an immune response against that antigen through
the production of antibodies.
Blood bank—A laboratory that specializes in blood
typing, antibody identification, and transfusion
services.
Blood type—Blood categories based on the presence or absence of certain antigens on the red
blood cells.
Crossmatch—A laboratory test done to confirm
that blood from a donor and blood from the recipient are compatible.
Gene—A piece of DNA, located on a chromosome, that determines how traits such as blood
type are inherited and expressed.
Immune response—The body’s attack against an
antigen that it considers foreign to itself. The attack
begins with the production of antibodies against
the antigen.
Rh blood type—Blood type based on the presence
or absence of the D antigen on the red blood cells.
Transfusion—The therapeutic introduction of
blood or a blood component into a patient’s
bloodstream.

The RhIg attaches to any Rh-positive cells from the
baby in the mother’s bloodstream, preventing them
from triggering anti-D antibody production in the
mother. An Rh-negative woman should also receive
RhIg following a miscarriage, abortion, or ectopic
pregnancy.
OTHER BLOOD GROUP SYSTEMS. Several other
blood group systems may be involved in HDN and
transfusion reactions, although they are much less
frequent than ABO and Rh. They are the Duffy,
Kell, Kidd, MNS, and P systems. Tests for antigens
from these systems are not included in routine blood
typing, but they are commonly used in paternity
testing.

594

Like Rh antibodies, antibodies in these systems
do not develop naturally, but as an immune response
after transfusion or during pregnancy. An antibody
screening test is done before a crossmatch to check
for unexpected antibodies to antigens in these systems. A person’s serum is mixed in a test tube with
commercially-prepared cells containing antigens
from these systems. If clumping occurs, the antibody
is identified.
Crossmatching
Crossmatching is the final step in pretransfusion
testing. It is commonly referred to as compatibility
testing, or ‘‘Type and Cross.’’
Before blood from a donor and the recipient are
crossmatched, both are ABO and Rh typed. In addition, antibody screening is done to look for antibodies to certain Rh, Duffy, MNS, Kell, Kidd, and
P system antigens. If an antibody to one of these
antigens is found, only blood without that antigen
will be compatible in a crossmatch. This sequence
must be repeated before each transfusion a person
receives.
To begin the crossmatch, blood from a donor with
the same ABO and Rh type as the rcipient is selected.
In a test tube, serum from the patient is mixed with red
blood cells from the donor. If clumping occurs, the
blood is not compatible; if clumping does not occur,
the blood is compatible. If an unexpected antibody is
found in either the patient or the donor, the blood
bank does further testing to make sure the blood is
compatible.
In an emergency, when there is not enough time
for blood typing and crossmatching, O red blood cells
may be given, preferably Rh-negative. O blood type is
called the universal donor because it has no ABO
antigens for a patient’s antibodies to attack. In contrast, AB blood type is called the universal recipient
because it has no ABO antibodies to attack the antigens on transfused red blood cells. If there is time
for blood typing, red blood cells of the recipient type
(type specific cells) are given. In either case, the crossmatch is continued, even though the transfusion has
begun.

Preparation
To collect the 10 mL blood needed for these tests,
a healthcare worker ties a tourniquet above the
patient’s elbow, locates a vein in the inner elbow
region, and inserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Blood typing and crossmatching must be done
three days or less before a transfusion. A person
doesn’t need to change diet, medications, or activities
before these tests. He should tell his healthcare provider if, during the last three months, he has received a
blood transfusion or a plasma substitute, or has had a
radiology procedure using intravenous contrast
media. These can give false clumping reactions in
both typing and crossmatching tests.

Aftercare
The possible side effects of any blood collection
are discomfort or bruising at the site where the
needle punctured the skin, as well as dizziness or fainting. Bruising is reduced if pressure is applied with a
finger to the puncture site until the bleeding stops.
Discomfort is treated with warm packs to the
puncture site.

Risks
There are no risks from the blood collection or
test procedures. Blood transfusions always have the
risk of an unexpected transfusion reaction. A nurse
watches a patient for signs of a reaction during the
entire transfusion.

I Blood urea nitrogen test
Definition
The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test measures the
level of urea nitrogen in a sample of the patient’s
blood. Urea is a substance that is formed in the liver
when the body breaks down protein. Urea then circulates in the blood in the form of urea nitrogen. In
healthy people, most urea nitrogen is filtered out by
the kidneys and leaves the body in the urine. If the
patient’s kidneys are not functioning properly or if the
body is using large amounts of protein, the BUN level
will rise. If the patient has severe liver disease, the BUN
will drop.

Purpose
The BUN level may be checked in order to assess

Description

Normal results
There is no normal blood type. The desired result
of a crossmatch is that compatible donor blood is
found. Compatibility testing procedures are designed
to provide the safest blood product possible for the
recipient, but a compatible crossmatch is no guarantee
that an unexpected adverse reaction will not appear
during the transfusion.

Abnormal results
Except in an emergency, a person cannot receive a
transfusion without a compatible crossmatch result.
Resources

The BUN test is performed on a sample of the
patient’s blood, withdrawn from a vein into a vacuum
tube. The procedure, which is called a venipuncture,
takes about five minutes.

Preparation
The doctor should check to make sure that the
patient is not taking any medications that can affect
BUN results. These drugs include the antibiotics chloramphenicol, streptomycin, amphotericin B, methicillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin, as well
as diuretics and corticosteroids.
The patient should be advised not to eat large
amounts of meat the day before the test.

KEY TERMS
Urea—A compound containing nitrogen that
occurs in the urine and other body fluids as a result
of protein metabolism.

Risks
The primary risk is the possibility of a bruise or
swelling in the area of the venipuncture. The patient
can apply moist warm compresses.

Normal results
Normal BUN levels are 5-18 mg/dL for children;
7-18 mg/dL for adults; and 8-20 mg/dL in the elderly.

Abnormal results
BUN levels can be too low as well as too high.
Abnormally low BUN
Low levels of BUN may indicate overhydration,
malnutrition, celiac disease [a disease characterized by
the inability ot tolerate foods containing wheat protein (gluten)], liver damage or disease, or use of corticosteroids. Low BUN may also occur in early
pregnancy.

I Body dysmorphic disorder
Definition
Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is defined by
DSM-IV-TR as a condition marked by excessive preoccupation with an imaginary or minor defect in a
facial feature or localized part of the body. The diagnostic criteria specify that the condition must be sufficiently severe to cause a decline in the patient’s social,
occupational, or educational functioning. The most
common cause of this decline is the time lost
in obsessing about the ‘‘defect’’—one study found
that 68 percent of patients in a sample of adolescents
diagnosed with BDD spent three or more hours every
day thinking about the body part or facial feature of
concern. DSM-IV assigns BDD to the larger category
of somatoform disorders, which are disorders characterized by physical complaints that appear to be
medical in origin but that cannot be explained in
terms of a physical disease, the results of substance
abuse, or by another mental disorder.
The earliest known case of BDD in the medical
literature was reported by an Italian physician named
Enrique Morselli in 1886, but the disorder was not
defined as a formal diagnostic category until DSMIII-R in 1987. The World Health Organization
(WHO) did not add BDD to the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD) until 1992. The
word dysmorphic comes from two Greek words that
mean ‘‘bad’’ or ‘‘ugly’’ and ‘‘shape’’ or ‘‘form.’’ BDD
was previously known as dysmorphophobia.

Abnormally high BUN
High levels of BUN may indicate kidney disease or
failure; blockage of the urinary tract by a kidney stone
or tumor; a heart attack or congestive heart failure;
dehydration; fever; shock; or bleeding in the digestive
tract. High BUN levels can sometimes occur during
late pregnancy or result from eating large amounts of
protein-rich foods. A BUN level higher than 100 mg/
dL points to severe kidney damage.

Description
BDD is characterized by an unusual degree of
worry or concern about a specific part of the face or
body, rather than the general size or shape of the body.
It is distinguished from anorexia nervosa and bulimia
nervosa in that patients with eating disorders are
preoccupied with their overall weight and body
shape. As many as 50 percent of patients diagnosed
with BDD undergo plastic surgery to correct their
perceived physical defects.
Since the publication of DSM-IV in 1994, some
psychiatrists have suggested that there is a subtype of
BDD, namely muscle dysmorphia. Muscle dysmorphia is marked by excessive concern with one’s muscularity and/or fitness. Persons with muscle
dysmorphia spend unusual amounts of time working
out in gyms or exercising rather than dieting obsessively or seeking plastic surgery. DSM-IV-TR added
references to concern about body build and excessive

Body image—A term that refers to a person s inner
picture of his or her outward appearance. It has
two components: perceptions of the appearance
of one’s body, and emotional responses to those
perceptions.
Delusion—A false belief that is resistant to reason
or contrary to actual fact. Common delusions
include delusions of persecution, delusions about
one s importance (sometimes called delusions of
grandeur), or delusions of being controlled by
others. In BDD, the delusion is related to the
patient’s perception of his or her body.
Displacement—A psychological process in which
feelings originating from one source are expressed
outwardly in terms of concern or preoccupation
with an issue or problem that the patient considers
more acceptable. In some BDD patients, obsession
about the body includes displaced feelings, often
related to a history of childhood abuse.
Muscle dysmorphia—A subtype of BDD, described
as excessive preoccupation with muscularity and
body building to the point of interference with
social, educational, or occupational functioning.
Serotonin—A chemical produced by the brain that
functions as a neurotransmitter. Low serotonin
levels are associated with mood disorders, particularly depression. Medications known as selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to

depressed mood.

weight lifting to DSM-IV’s description of BDD in
order to cover muscle dysmorphia.
BDD and muscle dysmorphia can both be
described as disorders resulting from the patient’s
distorted body image. Body image refers to a person’s mental picture of his or her outward appearance, including size, shape, and form. It has two
major components: how the person perceives their
physical appearance, and how they feel about their
body. Significant distortions in self-perception can
lead to intense dissatisfaction with one’s body and
dysfunctional behaviors aimed at improving one’s
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

appearance. Some patients with BDD are aware
that their concerns are excessive, but others do
not have this degree of insight; about 50 percent
of patients diagnosed with BDD also meet the
criteria for a delusional disorder.
The usual age of onset of BDD is late childhood or
early adolescence; the average age of patients diagnosed with the disorder is 17. BDD has a high rate of
comorbidity, which means that people diagnosed with
the disorder are highly likely to have been diagnosed
with another psychiatric disorder—most commonly
major depression, social phobia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). About 29% of patients with
BDD eventually try to commit suicide.
BDD is thought to affect 1–2 percent of the general population in the United States and Canada,
although some doctors think that it is underdiagnosed
because it coexists so often with depression and other
disorders. In addition, patients are often ashamed of
grooming rituals and other behaviors associated with
BDD, and may avoid telling their doctor about them.
BDD is thought to affect men and women equally;
however, there are no reliable data as of the early
2000s regarding racial or ethnic differences in the incidence of the disorder.

Causes and symptoms
Causes
The causes of BDD fall into two major categories,
neurobiological and psychosocial.
NEUROBIOLOGICAL CAUSES. Research indicates
that patients diagnosed with BDD have serotonin
levels that are lower than normal. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter— a chemical produced by the brain that
helps to transmit nerve impulses across the junctions
between nerve cells. Low serotonin levels are associated with depression and other mood disorders.
PSYCHOSOCIAL CAUSES. Another important factor in the development of BDD is the influence of the
mass media in developed countries, particularly the
role of advertising in spreading images of physically
‘‘perfect’’ men and women. Impressionable children
and adolescents absorb the message that anything
short of physical perfection is unacceptable. They
may then develop distorted perceptions of their own
faces and bodies.

A young person’s family of origin also has a powerful influence on his or her vulnerability to BDD.
Children whose parents are themselves obsessed with
appearance, dieting, and/or body building, or who are
597

Body dysmorphic disorder

KEY TERMS

Body dysmorphic disorder

highly critical of their children’s looks, are at greater
risk of developing BDD.
An additional factor in some young people is a
history of childhood trauma or abuse. Buried feelings
about the abuse or traumatic incident may emerge
in the form of obsession about a part of the face or
body. This ‘‘reassignment’’ of emotions from the unacknowledged true cause to another issue is called displacement. For example, an adolescent who frequently
felt overwhelmed in childhood by physically abusive
parents may develop a preoccupation at the high
school level with muscular strength and power.
Symptoms
The central symptom of BDD is excessive concern
with a specific facial feature or body part. Research
indicates that the features most likely to be the focus of
the patient’s attention are (in order of frequency) complexion flaws (acne, blemishes, scars, wrinkles); hair
(on the head or the body, too much or too little); and
facial features (size, shape, or lack of symmetry). The
patient’s concerns may, however, involve other body
parts, and may shift over time from one feature to
another.
Other symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder
include:


Ritualistic behavior. Ritualistic behavior refers to
actions that the patient performs to manage anxiety
and that take up excessive amounts of his or her time.
Patients are typically upset if someone or something
interferes with or interrupts their ritual. Ritualistic
behaviors in BDD may include exercise or makeup
routines, assuming specific poses or postures in front
of a mirror, etc.



Camouflaging the ‘‘problem’’ feature or body part
with makeup, hats, or clothing. Camouflaging
appears to be the single most common symptom
among patients with BDD; it is reported by 94%.



Abnormal behavior around mirrors, car bumpers,
large windows, or similar reflecting surfaces. A
majority of patients diagnosed with BDD frequently
check their appearance in mirrors or spend long
periods of time doing so. A minority, however,
react in the opposite fashion and avoid mirrors
whenever possible.



Frequent requests for reassurance from others about
their appearance.



Frequently comparing one’s appearance to others.



Avoiding activities outside the home, including
school and social events.

598

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of BDD in children or adolescents
is often made by physicians in family practice because
they are more likely to have developed long-term relationships of trust with young people. At the adult
level, it is often specialists in dermatology, cosmetic
dentistry, or plastic surgery who may suspect that the
patient suffers from BDD because of frequent requests
for repeated or unnecessary procedures. Reported
rates of BDD among dermatology and cosmetic surgery patients range between 6 and 15 percent. The
diagnosis is made on the basis of the patient’s history
together with the physician’s observations of the
patient’s overall mood and conversation patterns.
People with BDD often come across to others as generally anxious and worried. In addition, the patient’s
dress or clothing styles may suggest a diagnosis of
BDD. It is not unusual, however, for patients with
BDD to take offense if their primary care doctor
suggests referral to a psychiatrist.
Some physicians may use a self-report questionnaire, such as the Multidimensional Body-Self
Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ) or the short form
of the Situational Inventory of Body-Image Dysphoria
(SIBID), to evaluate patients during an office visit.
There are no brain imaging studies or laboratory
tests as of the early 2000s that can be used to diagnose
BDD.

Treatment
The standard course of treatment for body dysmorphic disorder is a combination of medications and
psychotherapy. Surgical, dental, or dermatologic
treatments have been found to be ineffective.
The medications most frequently prescribed for
patients with BDD are the selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, most commonly fluoxetine (Prozac) or sertraline (Zoloft). Other SSRIs that have been used with
this group of patients include fluvoxamine (Luvox)
and paroxetine (Paxil). In fact, it is the relatively high
rate of positive responses to SSRIs among BDD
patients that led to the hypothesis that the disorder
has a neurobiological component related to serotonin
levels in the body. An associated finding is that
patients with BDD require higher dosages of SSRI
medications than patients who are being treated for
depression with these drugs.
The most effective approach to psychotherapy
with BDD patients is cognitive-behavioral restructuring. Since the disorder is related to delusions about one’s
appearance, cognitive-oriented therapy that challenges
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Some doctors recommend couples therapy or
family therapy in order to involve the patient s parents,
spouse, or partner in his or her treatment. This
approach may be particularly helpful if family members are critical of the patient s looks or are reinforcing
his or her unrealistic body image.

Alternative treatment
Although no alternative or complementary
form of treatment has been recommended specifically for BDD, such herbal remedies for depression
as St. John’s wort have been reported as helping some
BDD patients. Aromatherapy appears to be a useful
aid to relaxation techniques as well as a pleasurable
physical experience for BDD patients. Yoga has
helped some persons with BDD acquire more realistic
perceptions of their bodies and to replace obsessions
about external appearance with new respect for their
body’s inner structure and functioning.

Prognosis
As of early 2005, the prognosis of BDD is considered good for patients receiving appropriate treatment. On the other hand, researchers do not know
enough about the lifetime course of body dysmorphic
disorder to offer detailed statistics. DSM-IV-TR notes
that the disorder ‘‘has a fairly continuous course, with
few symptom-free intervals, although the intensity of
symptoms may wax and wane over time.’’

Prevention
Given the pervasive influence of the mass media in
contemporary Western societies, the best preventive
strategy involves challenging their unrealistic images
of attractive people. Parents, teachers, primary health
care professionals, and other adults who work with
young people can point out and discuss the pitfalls of
trying to look ‘‘perfect.’’ In addition, parents or other
adults can educate themselves about BDD and its
symptoms, and pay attention to any warning signs in
their children’s dress or behavior.

I Boils
Definition
Boils and carbuncles are bacterial infections of
hair follicles and surrounding skin that form pustules
(small blister-like swellings containing pus) around
the follicle. Boils are sometimes called furuncles. A
carbuncle is formed when several furuncles merge
to form a single deep abscess with several heads or
drainage points.

Boils

inaccurate self-perceptions is more effective than purely
supportive approaches. Thought-stopping and relaxation techniques also work well with BDD patients
when they are combined with cognitive restructuring.

Boils

Description
Boils and carbuncles are firm reddish swellings
about 0.2–0.4in (5-10 mm) across that are slightly raised
above the skin surface. They are sore to the touch. A
boil usually has a visible central core of pus; a carbuncle
is larger and has several visible heads. Boils occur most
commonly on the face, back of the neck, buttocks,
upper legs and groin area, armpits, and upper torso.
Carbuncles are less common than single boils; they are
most likely to form at the back of the neck. Males are
more likely to develop carbuncles.
Boils and carbuncles are common problems in the
general population, particularly among adolescents
and adults. People who are more likely to develop
these skin infections include those with:


diabetes, especially when treated by injected insulin



alcoholism or drug abuse



poor personal hygiene



crowded living arrangements



jobs or hobbies that expose them to greasy or oily
substances, especially petroleum products



allergies or immune system disorders, including HIV
infection.



family members with recurrent skin infections

Boils often occur from a bacterial infection in a hair follicle or
skin gland. (Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by
permission.)

Causes and symptoms
Boils and carbuncles are caused by Staphylococcus
aureus, a bacterium that causes an infection in an oil
gland or hair follicle. Although the surface of human
skin is usually resistant to bacterial infection, S. aureus
can enter through a break in the skin surface–including
breaks caused by needle punctures for insulin or drug
injections. Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy
creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are
more vulnerable to infection. Bacterial skin infections
can be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close
human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or
carbuncle.
As the infection develops, an area of inflamed tissue gradually forms a pus-filled swelling or pimple that
is painful to touch. As the boil matures, it forms a
yellowish head or point. It may either continue to
swell until the point bursts open and allows the pus to
drain, or it may be gradually reabsorbed into the skin.
It takes between one and two weeks for a boil to heal
completely after it comes to a head and discharges
pus. The bacteria that cause the boil can spread into
other areas of the skin or even into the bloodstream
if the skin around the boil is injured by squeezing. If the

infection spreads, the patient will usually develop chills
and fever, swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenitis), and red
lines in the skin running outward from the boil.
Furunculosis is a word that is sometimes used
to refer to recurrent boils. Many patients have
repeated episodes of furunculosis that are difficult to
treat because their nasal passages carry colonies of
S. aureus. These bacterial colonies make it easy for
the patient’s skin to be reinfected. They are most likely
to develop in patients with diabetes, HIV infection, or
other immune system disorders.
Carbuncles are formed when the bacteria infect
several hair follicles that are close together.
Carbunculosis is a word that is sometimes used to
refer to the development of carbuncles. The abscesses
spread until they merge with each other to form a

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of boils and carbuncles is usually
made by the patient’s primary care doctor on the basis
of visual examination of the skin. In some cases involving recurrent boils on the face, the doctor may need
to consider acne as a possible diagnosis, but for the
most part boils and carbuncles are not difficult to
distinguish from other skin disorders.

Treatment

heads. Patients with carbuncles may also have a lowgrade fever or feel generally unwell.

KEY TERMS
Abscess—A localized collection of pus in the skin
or other body tissue.
Carbuncle—A large, deep skin abscess formed by a
group or cluster of boils.
Follicle—The small sac at the base of a hair shaft.
The follicle lies below the skin surface.
Furunculosis—A condition in which the patient
suffers from recurrent episodes of boils.
Pustule—A small raised pimple or blister-like swelling of the skin that contains pus.

Patient and family education
Patient education is an important part of the
treatment of boils and carbuncles. Patients need to
be warned against picking at or squeezing boils
because of the danger of spreading the infection into
other parts of the skin or bloodstream. It is especially
important to avoid squeezing boils around the mouth
or nose because infections in these areas can be carried
to the brain. Patients should also be advised about
keeping the skin clean, washing their hands carefully
before and after touching the boil or carbuncle, avoiding the use of greasy cosmetics or creams, and keeping
their towels and washcloths separate from those of
other family members. Some doctors may recommend
an antiseptic soap or gel for washing the infected
areas.
If the patient has had several episodes of furunculosis, the doctor may examine family members or close
contacts to see if they are carriers of S. aureus. In many
cases they also need treatment for boils or carbuncles.
Skin infections and reinfections involving small
groups or clusters of people are being reported more
frequently in the United States.
Medications
Boils are usually treated with application of antibiotic creams–usually clindamycin or polymyxin–following
the application of hot compresses. The compresses help
the infection to come to a head and drain.
Carbuncles and furunculosis are usually treated
with oral antibiotics as well as antibiotic creams or
ointments. The specific medications that are given
are usually dicloxacillin (Dynapen) or cephalexin
(Keflex). Erythromycin may be given to patients who
are allergic to penicillin. The usual course of oral antibiotics is 5-10 days; however, patients with recurrent
furunculosis may be given oral antibiotics for longer
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

periods. Furunculosis is treated with a combination of
dicloxacillin and rifampin (Rifadin).
Patients with bacterial colonies in their nasal passages are often given mupirocin (Bactroban) to apply
directly to the lining of the nose.
Surgical treatment
Boils and carbuncles that are very large, or that
are not draining, may be opened with a sterile needle
or surgical knife to allow the pus to drain. The doctor
will usually give the patient a local anesthetic if a knife
is used; surgical treatment of boils is painful and
usually leaves noticeable scars.

Alternative treatment
Naturopathic therapy
Naturopathic practitioners usually recommend
changes in the patient’s diet as well as applying herbal
poultices to the infected area. The addition of zinc
supplements and vitamin A to the diet is reported to
be effective in treating boils. The application of a paste
or poultice containing goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) root is recommended by naturopaths on the
grounds that goldenseal helps to kill bacteria and
reduce inflammation.
Homeopathy
Homeopaths maintain that taking the proper
homeopathic medication in the first stages of a boil
or carbuncle will bring about early resolution of the
infection and prevent pus formation. The most likely
choices are Belladonna or Hepar sulphuris. If the boil
601

Bone biopsy

has already formed, Mercurius vivus or Silica may be
recommended to bring the pus to a head.

Definition

Western herbal therapies
A variety of herbal remedies can be applied topically
to boils to fight infection. These include essential oils
of bergamot (Citrus bergamia), chamomile (Matricaria
recutita), lavender (Lavandula officinalis), and sage
(Salvia officinalis), as well as tea tree oil (Melaleuca
spp.). Herbalists also recommend washing the skin
with a mixture of goldenseal and witch hazel. To
fight the inflammation associated with boils, herbalists
suggest marsh mallow (Althaea officinalis) ointment,
tinctures (herbal solutions made with alcohol) of blue
flag (Iris versicolor) or myrrh (Commiphora molmol), and
slippery elm (Ulmus fulva) made into a poultice.

Bone biopsy is the removal of a piece of bone
for laboratory examination and analysis.

Purpose
Bone biopsy is used to distinguish between malignant tumors and benign bone disease such as osteoporosis and osteomyelitis. This test may be ordered
to determine why a patient’s bones ache or feel sore,
or when a mass or deformity is found on an x ray,
CT scan, bone scan, or other diagnostic imaging
procedure.

Precautions

Prognosis
The prognosis for most boils is excellent. Some
patients, however, suffer from recurrent carbuncles or
furunculosis. In addition, although the spread of infection from boils is relatively unusual, there have been
deaths reported from brain infections caused by
squeezing boils on the upper lip or in the tissue folds
at the base of the nose.

Prevention

The patient’s doctor and the surgeon who performs the bone biopsy must be told about any prescription and over-the-counter medications the
patient is taking, and about allergies or reactions the
patient has had to anesthetics or pain relievers. Special
care must be taken with patients who have experienced
bleeding problems.

Description

There are some precautions that people can take
to minimize the risk of developing bacterial skin
infections:


cleanse skin properly with soap and water, and take
showers rather than tub baths



do not share washcloths, towels, or facial cosmetics
with others



cut down on greasy or fatty foods and snacks



always wash hands before touching the face



consider using antiseptic soaps and shower gels



consult a doctor if furunculosis is a persistent problem–it may indicate an underlying disease such as
diabetes

I Bone biopsy

A bone biopsy involves using a special drill or
other surgical instruments to remove bone from the
patient’s body. The procedure usually lasts about 30
minutes and may be performed in the hospital, a doctor’s office, or a surgical center.
A drill biopsy is generally used to obtain a small
specimen. After the skin covering the bone has been
cleansed with an antiseptic and shaved, the patient
is given a local anesthetic. The doctor will not begin
the procedure until the anesthetic has numbed the
area from which the bone is to be removed, but the
patient may feel pressure or mild pain when
the needle pierces the bone. The surgeon turns the
needle in a half-circle to extract a sample from the
core, or innermost part, of the bone. The sample is
drawn into the hollow stem of the biopsy needle. The
sample is then sent to a laboratory, where it is examined under a microscope.
An open biopsy is used when a larger specimen is
needed. After the area covering the bone has been
cleansed with an antiseptic and shaved, the patient
is given a general anesthetic. After the anesthetic
takes effect and the patient is unconscious, the

surgeon makes an incision and removes a bone specimen. The specimen is sent to the laboratory for
immediate analysis. Results of that analysis may
indicate that additional surgery should be performed
right away.

Preparation
No special preparation is needed for a drill biopsy,
but a patient must fast for at least 12 hours before an
open biopsy.

Aftercare
Pain medication will be prescribed after a biopsy,
and vital signs will be monitored until they return to
normal. Most patients can go home in about an hour.
If bone was removed from the spine, the patient may
stay in the hospital overnight. The surgical site must be
kept clean and dry for 48 hours, and the patient’s
doctor should be notified if any of these symptoms
appear:


fever



headache



pain on movement



inflammation or pus near the biopsy site



bleeding through the bandage at the biopsy site

Risks
Risks include bone fracture, injury to nearby
tissue, and infection. Bleeding is a rare complication.
Factors that increase risk include:

I Bone density test
Definition
A bone density test, or scan, is designed to check
for osteoporosis, a disease that occurs when the bones
become thin and weak. Osteoporosis happens when
the bones lose calcium and other minerals that keep
them strong. Osteoporosis begins after menopause in
many women, and worsens after age 65, often resulting in serious fractures. These fractures may not only

To take a DEXA bone density scan, the patient
lies on a bed underneath the scanner, a curving plastic
arm that emits x rays. These low-dose x rays form a
fan beam that rotates around the patient. During the
test, the scanner moves to capture images of the
patient’s spine, hip or entire body. A computer then
compares the patient’s bone strength and risk of
fracture to that of other people in the United States
at the same age and to young people at peak bone
density. Bones reach peak density at age 30 and then
start to lose mass. The test takes about 20 minutes to
do and is painless. The DEXA bone scan costs about
$250. Some insurance companies and Medicare cover
the cost. pDEXA wrist bone scans in drugstores are
available for about $30.

one-fourth of women who fracture their hip after age
50 die within one year.
Most people today will get a bone density scan
from a machine using a technology called Dual Energy
X-ray Absorptiometry or DEXA for short. This
machine takes a picture of the bones in the spine,
hip, total body and wrist, and calculates their density.
If a DEXA machine is not available, bone density
scans can also be done with dual photon absorptiometry (measuring the spine, hip and total body) and
quantitative computed tomography scans (measuring
the spine). Bone density scanners that use DEXA technology to just measure bone density in the wrist (called
pDEXA scans) provide scans at some drugstores. Yet

I Bone disorder drugs
Definition
Bone disorder drugs are medicines used to treat
diseases that weaken the bones.

Normal results
The patient, when compared with people at
‘‘young normal bone density’’ (called the T-score)
has the same or denser bones than a healthy 30-yearold. T scores above 1 mean that a patient has a healthy
bone mass. Scores from 0 to 1 mean that the patient
has borderline bone mass and should repeat the test in
two to five years.

Abnormal results
The patient has two to four times the risk of a
broken bone as other people in the United States at the
same age and those at peak bone density. If a patient’s T
score ranges from 1 to 2.5 they have low bone mass
and are at risk for osteoporosis. A T score below 2.5
means osteoporosis is already evident. These patients
should have a repeat bone density scan every year or two.

Purpose
The drugs described here are used to treat or prevent osteoporosis (brittle bone disease) in women past
menopause as well as older men. They also are used
prescribed for Paget’s disease, a painful condition that
weakens and deforms bones, and they are used to
control calcium levels in the blood.
Bone is living tissue. Like other tissue, bone is
constantly being broken down and replaced with new
material. Normally, there is a balance between the
breakdown of old bone and its replacement with new
bone. But when something goes wrong with the
process, bone disorders may result.
Osteoporosis is a particular concern for women
after menopause, as well as for older men. In osteoporosis, the inside of the bones become porous and

KEY TERMS
Estrogen—The main sex hormone that controls
normal sexual development in females. During
the menstrual cycle, estrogen helps prepare the
body for possible pregnancy.
Fracture—A break or crack in a bone.
Hormone—A substance that is produced in one
part of the body, then travels through the bloodstream to another part of the body where it has its
effect.
Menopause—The stage in a woman’s life when the
ovaries stop producing egg cells at regular times
and menstruation stops.
Osteoporosis—A disease in which bones become
very porous and weak. The bones are then more
likely to fracture and take longer to heal. The condition is most common in women after menopause
but can also occur in older men.

thin. Over time, this condition weakens the bones
and makes them more likely to break. Osteoporosis
is four times more common in women than in men.
This is because women have less bone mass than men,
tend to live longer and take in less calcium, and need
the female hormone estrogen to keep their bones
strong. If men live long enough, they are also at risk
of getting osteoporosis later in life. Once total bone
mass has peaked–around age 35–all adults start to lose
it. In women, the rate of bone loss speeds up during
menopause, when estrogen levels fall. Bone loss may
also occur if both ovaries are removed by surgery.
Ovaries make estrogen. Hormone replacement therapy
is one approach to preventing osteoporosis. However,
not all people can use hormone replacement therapy.
Bone disorder drugs are a good alternative for people
who already have osteoporosis or who are at risk
of developing it. Risk factors include lack of regular
exercise, early menopause, being underweight, and a
strong family history of osteoporosis.

Description
Bone disorder drugs are available only with a physician’s prescription and come in tablet, nasal spray, and
injectable forms. Commonly used bone disorder drugs
are alendronate (Fosamax), calcitonin (Miacalcin,
Calcimar), and raloxifene (Evista). Raloxifene belongs
to a group of drugs known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), which act like estrogen in
some parts of the body but not in others. This makes
606

the drugs less likely to cause some of the harmful
effects that estrogen may cause. Unlike estrogen,
raloxifene does not increase the risk of breast cancer.
In fact, research suggests that raloxifene may even
reduce that risk.

Recommended dosage
Alendronate
FOR OSTEOPOROSIS. The usual dose is 10 mg once
a day. Treatment usually continues over many years.
FOR PAGET’S DISEASE. The usual dose is 40 mg

once a day for six months.
This medicine works only when it is taken with a
full glass of water first thing in the morning, at least 30
minutes before eating or drinking anything or taking
any other medicine. Do not lie down for at least 30
minutes after taking it because the drug can irritate the
esophagus, the tube that delivers food form the mouth
to the stomach.
Calcitonin
NASAL SPRAY. The usual dose is one spray into the
nose once a day. Alternate nostrils, spraying the right
nostril one day, the left nostril the next day, and so on.
INJECTABLE. The recommended dosage depends
on the condition for which the medicine is prescribed
and may be different for different people. Check with
the physician who prescribed the medicine or the
pharmacist who filled the prescription for the proper
dosage.

Raloxifene
The usual dose is one 60-mg tablet daily.

Precautions
Aldendronate
People with low levels of calcium in their blood
should not take this medicine. It also is not recommended for women on hormone replacement therapy
or for anyone with kidney problems. Before using
alendronate, anyone who has digestive or swallowing
problems should make sure that his or her physician
knows about the condition.
Calcitonin
Calcitonin nasal spray may cause irritation or
small sores in the nose. Check with a physician if this
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The injectable form of calcitonin has caused serious allergic reactions in a few people. The nasal spray
is not known to cause such reactions, but the possibility exists. Before starting treatment with calcitonin,
the physician who prescribes the drug may order an
allergy test to make sure there will not be a problem.

Side effects
Aldendronate
Common side effects include constipation, diarrhea, indigestion, nausea, pain in the abdomen, and
pain in the muscles and bones. These problems usually
go away as the body adjusts to the medicine and do not
need medical attention unless they continue or they
interfere with normal activities.

Raloxifene
A rare, but serious side effect of raloxifene is an
increased risk of blood clots that form in the veins and
may break away and travel to the lungs. This is about
as likely in women who take raloxifene as it is in
women who take estrogen. Because of this possible
problem, women with a history of blood clots in
their veins should not take raloxifene.
Women who have had breast cancer or cancer of
the uterus should check with their physicians about
whether they can safely use raloxifene.
General precautions for bone disorder drugs
To keep bones strong, the body needs calcium and
vitamin D. Dairy products and fish such as salmon,
sardines and tuna are good sources of both calcium and
vitamin D. People who are taking bone disorder drugs
for osteoporosis and who do not get enough of these
nutrients in their diets should check with their physicians about taking supplements. Other important
bone-saving steps are avoiding smoking and alcohol
and getting enough of the kind of exercise that puts
weight on the bones (such as walking or lifting weights).
People who are taking these drugs because they
have too much calcium in their blood may need to
limit the amount of calcium in their diets. Too much
calcium may prevent the medicine from working properly. Discuss the proper diet with the physician who
prescribed the drug, and do not make any diet changes
without the physician’s approval.
Anyone who has had unusual reactions to bone
disorder drugs in the past should let his or her physician know before taking the drugs again. The physician also should be told about any allergies to foods,
dyes, preservatives, or other substances.
Women who are pregnant or who may become
pregnant and women who are breastfeeding should
check with their physicians before using this alendronate or calcitonin. Raloxifene should not be used by
women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant. In laboratory studies of rats, raloxifene caused
birth defects.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Calcitonin
The most common side effects of calcitonin nasal
spray are nose problems, such as dryness, redness,
itching, sores, bleeding and general discomfort. These
problems should go away as the body adjusts to the
medicine, but if they do not or if they are very uncomfortable, check with a physician. Other side effects that
should be brought to a physician’s attention include
headache, back pain and joint pain.
Injectable calcitonin may cause minor side effects
such as nausea or vomiting; diarrhea; stomach pain;
loss of appetite; flushing of the face, ears, hands or
feet; and discomfort or redness at the place on the
body where it is injected. Medical attention is not
necessary unless these problems persist or cause unusual
discomfort.
Anyone who has a skin rash or hives after taking
injectable calcitonin should check with a physician as
soon as possible.
Raloxifene
Common side effects include hot flashes, leg
cramps, nausea and vomiting. Women who have these
problems while taking raloxifene should check with
their physicians.

Interactions
Aldendronate
Taking aspirin with alendronate may increase the
chance of upset stomach, especially if the dose of
alendronate is more than 10 mg per day. If an analgesic is necessary, switch to another drug, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or use buffered aspirin. Ask a
physician or pharmacist for the correct medication
to use.
Some calcium supplements, antacids and other
medicines keep the body from absorbing alendronate.
To prevent this problem, do not take any other medicine within 30 minutes of taking alendronate.

I Bone grafting
Definition
Bone grafting is a surgical procedure by which
new bone or a replacement material is placed into
spaces between or around broken bone (fractures) or
holes in bone (defects) to aid in healing.

Purpose
Bone grafting is used to repair bone fractures that
are extremely complex, pose a significant risk to the
patient, or fail to heal properly. Bone graft is also used
to help fusion between vertebrae, correct deformities,
or provide structural support for fractures of the
spine. In addition to fracture repair, bone graft is
used to repair defects in bone caused by birth defects,
traumatic injury, or surgery for bone cancer.

Description
Bone is composed of a matrix, mainly made up
of a protein called collagen. It is strengthened by

deposits of calcium and phosphate salts, called
hydroxyapatite. Within and around this matrix are
located the cells of the bones, which are of four types.
Osteoblasts produce the bone matrix. Osteocytes
are mature osteoblasts and serve to maintain the
bone. Osteoclasts break down and remove bone tissue. Bone lining cells cover bone surfaces. Together,
these four types of cells are responsible for building
the bone matrix, maintaining it, and remodeling the
bone as needed.
There are three ways in which a bone graft can
help repair a defect. The first is called osteogenesis, the
formation of new bone by the cells contained within
the graft. The second is osteoinduction, a chemical
process in which molecules contained within the graft
(bone morphogenetic proteins) convert the patient’s
cells into cells that are capable of forming bone. The
third is osteoconduction, a physical effect by which the
matrix of the graft forms a scaffold on which cells in
the recipient are able to form new bone.
New bone for grafting can be obtained from other
bones in the patient’s own body (e.g., hip bones or
ribs), called autograft, or from bone taken from other
people that is frozen and stored in tissue banks, called
allograft. A variety of natural and synthetic replacement materials are also used instead of bone, including
collagen (the protein substance of the white fibers of
the skin, bone, and connective tissues); polymers, such
as silicone and some acrylics; hydroxyapatite; calcium
sulfate; and ceramics. A new material, called resorbable
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

polymeric grafts, is also being studied. These resorbable grafts provide a structure for new bone to grow
on; the grafts then slowly dissolve, leaving only the
new bone behind.
To place the graft, the surgeon makes an incision
in the skin over the bone defect and shapes the bone
graft or replacement material to fit into the defect.
After the graft is placed into the defect, it is held in
place with pins, plates, or screws. The incision is closed
with stitches and a splint or cast is used to prevent
movement of the bones while healing.
The costs associated with a bone graft vary. These
costs include: the surgeon’s fee (variable); anesthesiologist’s fees (averaging $350 to $400 per hour); hospital
charges (averaging $1,500 to $1,800 per day, more for
intensive care or private rooms); medication charges
($200 to $400); and additional charges, including an
assisting surgeon, treatment of complications, diagnostic procedures (e.g., blood work or x rays), medical
supplies, and equipment use. The cost for the graft
itself can range from $250 to $900.
This procedure is covered by many third-party
insurers; insurance coverage should be explored for
each individual case.

Aftercare
The time required for convalescence for fractures
or spinal fusion may vary from one to 10 days, and
vigorous exercise may be limited for up to three
months.
Most bone grafts are successful in helping the
bone defect to heal. The extent of recovery will depend
on the size of the defect and the condition of the bone
surrounding the graft at the time of surgery. Severe
defects may take some time to heal and may require
further attention after the initial graft. In one study of
over 1,000 patients who received very large allografts
after surgery for bone cancer, researchers found that
approximately 85% of the patients were able to return
to work or normal physical activities without using
crutches. However, about 25% of these patients
required a second operation, because the first did not
heal properly. Less severe bone defects, though,
should heal completely without serious complications.

Risks
The risks for any surgical procedure requiring
anesthesia include reactions to the medications and
breathing problems. The risks for any surgical procedure include bleeding and infection.

KEY TERMS

The drawbacks of autografts include: the additional surgical and anesthesia time (typically 30 minutes per procedure) to obtain, or harvest, the bone for
grafting; added costs of the additional surgery; pain
and infection that might occur at the site from which
the graft is taken; and the relatively small amount of
bone that is available for grafting.
The drawbacks of allografts include: variability
between lots, since the bone is harvested from a variety
of donors; the bone may take longer to incorporate
with the host bone than an autograft would; the graft
may be less effective than an autograft; and the possibility of transferring diseases to the patient. Other
complications may result from the immune response
mounted by the patient’s immune system against the
grafted bone tissue. With the use anti-rejection agents

I Bone growth stimulation

Description
Electric stimulation can be applied either from the
inside of the body (invasively) or from the outside the
body (noninvasively). Ultrasound is a noninvasive
procedure. The type of stimulation selected depends
on the doctor’s preference, the type and location of the
fracture, and the patient’s motivation to comply with
the treatment schedule. Treatment can take anywhere
from three to six months.

Definition
Bone growth stimulation is the technique of promoting bone growth in difficult to heal fractures by applying
a low electrical current or ultrasound to the fracture.

Purpose
Bone growth stimulation is done when satisfactory healing is not occurring naturally or when the
pace of healing is too slow. This condition is called
fracture nonunion, and it occurs more frequently
among adults than children, in people with severe or
complex fractures, and in people who smoke.
The theory behind applying an electric current to
fractures to stimulate healing is based on the fact that
the concave side of the bone becomes negatively
charged and the convex side is positively charged. It
is believed that artificially encouraging this charging
with an electric current will speed healing. In 1996, the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved
610

Invasive stimulators
Invasive electric stimulators are either fully or
partially implantable. The advantage of these devices
is that they apply a direct electric current to the fracture 24 hours a day. The fully implantable stimulator
requires little daily attention from the patient. Patients
using a semi-implanted stimulator must regulate their
own treatment schedule and have to care for the external power pack. The disadvantage of implantable and
semi-implantable stimulators is that their implantation is a surgical procedure.
Fully implantable direct current stimulators are
installed in a hospital under general or regional
anesthesia. Both the stimulator and the power source
are implanted. The surgeon makes an incision and
places a spiral shaped cathode inside the bone. A
wire leads to the power source and a small anode.
The power source is a battery pack that is implanted
in the nearby muscle. The body transmits electrical
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Partially implanted stimulators use cathode pins
that are implanted at the edge of each bone that is
fractured. Wires lead to the surface of the skin where a
power source and the anode are located. Wires complete the circuit. The external portion of the device is
held in place by a cast. This source of stimulation also
runs continuously.
Noninvasive stimulators
In the noninvasive stimulator, external electromagnetic coils are placed on either side of the fracture
and are held in place by a strap or cuff. Locating the
coils correctly is important, and their location relative
to the fracture is usually confirmed by x rays.
The coils produce a pulsating electromagnetic
field. It is up to the patient to maintain the prescribed
treatment schedule. Effective treatment requires stimulation anywhere from three to ten hours each day
in periods of no less than one hour.
Ultrasound stimulation is the most recent treatment for stimulating bone growth. A device that generates low intensity pulses of sound is applied to the
skin over the fracture. The advantage of this technique
is that it is noninvasive and the period of application of
the sound pulses can be as short as 20-30 minutes each
day. The results of this treatment have been studied
less than the effect of electromagnetic stimulation.

unit works and caring for external devices and the
casts that hold them in place.

Risks
Noninvasive devices have few risks associated
with them. The main risk associated with implantable
devices is the development of infection at the site of
implantation.

Normal results
Success in healing a fracture nonunion using bone
growth stimulation depends on the type, location, and
severity of the fracture and the age and general health
of the patient.

Preparation
Bone growth stimulation is done only when healing has failed to occur for many months. Before it is
started, x rays are done of the fracture area. If the
device is to be implanted, standard preoperative
blood and urine tests are done. The patient may meet
with an anesthesiologist to discuss any conditions that
might affect the administration of anesthesia.

Aftercare
If a noninvasive, pulsating, electromagnetic field
device is used, the patient must not put any stress or
weight on the fracture until it is healed, which is a
matter of months in most cases. In all lower limb
fractures, regardless of the stimulation method used,
the patient can not bear weight on the limb with the
fracture until healing is complete. This limits the

Description
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be
performed by a physician or nurse clinician. Each
procedure takes about 20 to 30 minutes and is usually
performed on an outpatient basis, but can be done in a
hospital if necessary.
The skin covering the biopsy site is cleansed with
an antiseptic, and the patient may be given a mild
sedative. A local anesthetic is administered. The
hematologist or nurse clinician performing the procedure will not begin until the anesthetic has numbed
the area from which the specimen is to be extracted.
In both adults and children, aspiration and biopsy
are most commonly performed on the rear bone of
the hip (posterior iliac crest). In adults, sampling
from the sternum (breastbone) is sometimes done.
The latter location is technically easier, but is
somewhat more painful for the patient and presents
the risk of heart injury. On rare occasions, a long
bone of the leg (tibia) may be used as a sample site
for an infant.
In a bone marrow aspiration, a special needle is
inserted beneath the skin and rotated until it penetrates the cortex, or outer covering of the bone. At
least half a teaspoon of marrow is withdrawn from
the bone by a syringe attached to the needle. The
patient may experience discomfort when the needle
is inserted or when the marrow is aspirated. If more
marrow is needed, the needle is repositioned slightly,
a new syringe is attached, and a second sample is
taken. The samples are transferred from the syringes
to slides and vials, then sent to a laboratory for
analysis.
Bone marrow biopsy may be performed immediately before or after bone marrow aspiration. The
procedure utilizes a special large-bore needle that is
used to drill out a core of marrow. In bone marrow
biopsy, the needle is inserted, rotated from side to side,
withdrawn, and reinserted at a different angle. This
procedure is repeated if needed until a small core,
about 0.4 inches (1 cm) long, is separated from the
bone marrow. The needle is again removed, and a
piece of fine wire threaded through its tip transfers
the specimen onto sterile gauze. The patient may feel
discomfort or pressure when the needle is inserted and
experience a brief, pulling sensation when the marrow
is withdrawn. Unlike aspiration specimens, which are
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

smeared, these samples contain structurally intact
bone marrow. Microscopic examination can show
what material its cells contain and how they are alike
or different from one another. The bone may either be
embedded intact in paraffin (a type of wax), or be
decalcified (a process which takes place overnight)
for a different type of staining and examination.
Each type of preparation has certain advantages.

Preparation
A current history and physical are obtained from
the patient, along with proper consent. The patient is
generally placed in a prone position (lying face down)
for preparation, and local anesthetic, with or without
sedation, is administered.

Aftercare
After the needle is removed, the biopsy site will be
covered with a clean, dry bandage. Pressure is applied
to control bleeding. The patient’s pulse, breathing,
blood pressure, and temperature are monitored until
they return to normal, and the patient may be
instructed to remain in a supine position (lying face
up) for half an hour before getting dressed.
The patient should be able to leave the clinic and
resume normal activities immediately. Patients who
have received a sedative often feel sleepy for the rest
of the day; driving, cooking, and other activities that
require clear thinking and quick reactions should
therefore be avoided.
The biopsy site should be kept covered and dry
for several hours. Walking or taking prescribed pain
medications usually ease any discomfort felt at the
biopsy site, and ice can be used to reduce swelling.
A doctor should be notified if the patient:


feels severe pain more than 24 hours after the procedure.



experiences persistent bleeding or notices more than
a few drops of blood on the wound dressing.



has a temperature above 101  F (38.3  C). Inflammation and pus at the biopsy site and other signs
of infection should also be reported to a doctor without delay.

Risks
Bleeding and discomfort often occur at the biopsy
site. Infection and hematoma may also develop. In
rare instances, the heart or a major blood vessel is
pierced when marrow is extracted from the sternum

I Bone marrow transplantation
Definition
The bone marrow—the sponge-like tissue found
in the center of certain bones—contains stem cells that
are the precursors of white blood cells, red blood cells,
and platelets. These blood cells are vital for normal
body functions, such as oxygen transport, defense
against infection and disease, and clotting. Blood
cells have a limited lifespan and are constantly being
replaced; therefore, healthy stem cells are vital.
In association with certain diseases, stem cells
may produce too many, too few, or otherwise abnormal blood cells. Also, medical treatments may
destroy stem cells or alter blood cell production.
The resultant blood cell abnormalities can be life
threatening.
Bone marrow transplantation involves extracting
bone marrow containing normal stem cells from a
healthy donor, and transferring it to a recipient
whose body cannot manufacture proper quantities of
normal blood cells. The goal of the transplant is to
rebuild the recipient’s blood cells and immune system
and hopefully cure the underlying ailment.

In autologous bone marrow transplantation, stem cells are
collected from the patient. Once the patient has undergone
chemotherapy, the cells are replaced in the blood via an
intravenous catheter. The cells return to the bone marrow
and begin producing healthy new cells. (Illustration by
Argosy Inc.)

Purpose
A person’s red blood cells, white blood cells, and
platelets may be destroyed or may be abnormal due to
disease. Also, certain medical therapies, particularly
chemotherapy or radiation treatment, may destroy a
person’s stem cells. The consequence to a person’s
health is severe. Under normal circumstances, red
blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body and
remove carbon dioxide from the body’s tissues.
White blood cells form the cornerstone of the body’s
immune system and defend it against infection.
Platelets limit bleeding by enabling the blood to clot
if a blood vessel is damaged.
A bone marrow transplant is used to rebuild the
body’s capacity to produce these blood cells and bring
their numbers to normal levels. Illnesses that may be
treated with a bone marrow transplant include both
cancerous and noncancerous diseases.
Cancerous diseases may or may not specifically
involve blood cells; but, cancer treatment can destroy
the body’s ability to manufacture new blood cells. Bone
marrow transplantation may be used in conjunction
with additional treatments, such as chemotherapy, for

Precautions
Bone marrow transplants are not for everyone.
Transplants are accompanied by a risk of infection,
transplant rejection by the recipient’s immune system,
and other complications. The procedure has a lower
success rate the greater the recipient’s age. Complications are exacerbated for people whose health is
already seriously impaired as in late-stage cancers.
Therefore, a person’s age or state of health may
prohibit use of a bone marrow transplant. The typical
cut-off age for a transplant ranges from 40 to 55 years;
however, a person’s general health is usually the more
important factor.
Even in the absence of complications, the transplant and associated treatments are hard on the
recipient. Bone marrow transplants are debilitating. A
person’s ability to withstand the rigors of the transplant
is a key consideration in deciding to use this treatment.

Description
Autologous and allogeneic transplants
Two important requirements for a bone marrow
transplant are the donor and the recipient. Sometimes,
the donor and the recipient may be the same person.
This type of transplant is called an autologous

affects hemoglobin production. (Hemoglobin is the
substance within red blood cells that enables them to

fatal.

transplant. It is typically used in cases in which a
person’s bone marrow is generally healthy but will be
destroyed due to medical treatment for diseases such
as breast cancer and Hodgkin’s disease. Most bone
marrow transplants are autologous. If a person’s
bone marrow is unsuitable for an autologous transplant, the bone marrow must be derived from another
person in an allogeneic transplant.
Allogeneic transplants are more complicated
because of proteins called human lymphocyte antigens
(HLA) that are on the surface of bone marrow cells. If
the donor and the recipient have very dissimilar antigens, the recipient’s immune system regards the
donor’s bone marrow cells as invaders and launches
a destructive attack against them. Such an attack
negates any benefits offered by the transplant.
HLA matching
There are only five major HLA classes or types—
designated HLA–A,–B, –C,–D, and class III—but
much variation within the groupings. For example,
HLA–A from one individual may be similar to, but
not the same as, HLA–A in another individual; such a
situation can render a transplant from one to the other
impossible.
HLA matching is more likely if the donor and
recipient are related, particularly if they are siblings;
however, an unrelated donor may be a potential
match. Only in rare cases is matching HLA types
between two people not an issue: if the recipient has an
identical twin. Identical twins carry the same genes;
therefore, the same antigens. A bone marrow transplant
between identical twins is called a syngeneic transplant.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

A relatively recent development in stem cell
transplantation is the use of peripheral blood cells
instead of stem cells from bone marrow. Peripheral
blood stem cells (PBSCs) are obtained from circulating blood rather than from bone marrow, but
the amount of stem cells found in the peripheral
blood is much smaller than the amount of stem
cells found in the bone marrow. Peripheral blood
stem cells can be used in either autologous or
allogeneic transplants. The majority of PBSC
transplants are autologous. However, recent clinical studies indicate that PBSCs are being used
more frequently than bone marrow for allogeneic
bone marrow transplantation.
The advantages of PBSC transplants when compared to bone marrow transplants are: in allogeneic
transplantation, haematopoietic and immune recovery are faster with PBSCs which reduces the potential
for disease recurrence, primarily graft-versus-hostdisease. In autologous transplantation, the use of
PBSCs can result in faster blood count recoveries.
Also, some medical conditions exist in which the recipient cannot accept bone marrow stem cell transplants,
but can accept PBSC transplants. Some possible disadvantages to PBSC transplant versus bone marrow
transplantation are: so much more fluid volume is
necessary to collect enough PBSCs that, at the time of
infusing the new stem cells into the recipient, the fluid
can collect in the lungs or cause temporary kidney
problems. Also, the time commitment for the donor
for a PBSC transplant is considerable. When the
PBSCs are being collected, several outpatient sessions
are needed and each session lasts approximately two–
four hours.
The transplant procedure
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION. The bone

marrow extraction, or harvest, is the same whether
for an autologous or allogeneic transplant.
Harvesting is done under general anesthesia (i.e., the
donor sleeps through the procedure), and discomfort
is usually minimal afterwards. Bone marrow is drawn
from the iliac crest (the part of the hip bone to either
side of the lower back) with a special needle and a
syringe. Several punctures are usually necessary to
collect the needed amount of bone marrow, approximately 1–2 quarts (0.9–1.91). (This amount is only a
small percentage of the total bone marrow and is
typically replaced within four weeks.) The donor
remains at the hospital for 24–48 hours and can
resume normal activities within a few days.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

If the bone marrow is meant for an autologous
transplant, it is stored at -112 to -320  F (-80 to
-196  C) until it is needed. Bone marrow for an allogeneic transplant is sometimes treated to remove the
donor’s T cells (a type of white blood cell) or to remove
ABO (blood type) antigens; otherwise, it is transplanted without modification.
The bone marrow is administered to the recipient
via a catheter (a narrow, flexible tube) inserted into a
large vein in the chest. From the bloodstream, it
migrates to the cavities within the bones where bone
marrow is normally stored. If the transplant is successful, the bone marrow begins to produce normal blood
cells once it is in place, or engrafted.
PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION. Before collection for a PBSC transplant,

donors receive daily four injections of the drug
G-CSF, or filgrastim. (Patients can give it to themselves at home if need be.) These pretreatments stimulate the body to release stem cells into the blood. After
these pretreatments, the donors’ experience is similar
to that of a whole blood donor’s experience— PBSC
donors’ blood is collected at a clinic or hospital as an
outpatient procedure. The differences are that several
sessions will be needed over days or weeks and the
blood is collected in a process called apheresis. The
blood travels from one arm into a blood cell separator
that removes only the stem cells, and the rest of the
blood is returned back to the donor, in the other arm.
The cells are then frozen for later use.
The PBSCs are administered to the recipient using
the same methods as those used in bone marrow transplantation. As stated, the amount of fluid with PBSCs
infused into the recipient’s body can be an issue.
Costs
Bone marrow transplantation is an expensive procedure. (Bone marrow donors are volunteers and do
not pay for any part of the procedure.) Insurance
companies and health maintenance organizations
(HMOs) may not cover the costs.

Preparation
A bone marrow transplant recipient can expect to
spend four to eight weeks in the hospital. In preparation
for receiving the transplant, the recipient undergoes
‘‘conditioning’’—a preparative regimen in which the
bone marrow and abnormal cells are destroyed.
Conditioning rids the body of diseased cells and
makes room for the marrow to be transplanted. It
typically involves chemotherapy and/or radiation
617

treatment, depending on the disease being treated.
Unfortunately, this treatment also destroys healthy
cells and has many side effects such as extreme weakness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. These side effects
may continue for several weeks.

Aftercare
A two- to four-week waiting period follows the
marrow transplant before its success can begin to be
judged. The marrow recipient is kept in isolation during this time to minimize potential infections. The
recipient also receives antibiotic medications and
blood and platelet transfusions to help fight off infection and prevent excessive bleeding. Further side
effects, such as nausea and vomiting, can be treated
with other medications. Once blood counts are normal
and the side effects of the transplant abate, the recipient is taken off antibiotics and usually no longer needs
blood and platelet transfusions.
Following discharge from the hospital, the recipient is monitored through home visits by nurses or outpatient visits for up to a year. For the first several
months out of the hospital, the recipient needs to be
careful in avoiding potential infections. For example,
contact with other people who may be ill should be
avoided or kept to a minimum. Further blood transfusions and medications may be necessary, but barring
complications, the recipient can return to normal
activities about 6–8 months after the transplant.

Risks
Bone marrow transplants are accompanied by
serious and life-threatening risks. Furthermore, they
are not always an absolute assurance of a cure for the
underlying ailment; a disease may recur in the future.
Approximately 30% of people receiving allogeneic transplants do not survive. Autologous transplants have a
much better survival rate—nearly 90%—but are not
appropriate for all types of ailments requiring a bone
marrow transplant. Furthermore, they have a higher
failure rate with certain diseases, specifically leukemia.
In the short term, there is the danger of pneumonia
or other infectious disease, excessive bleeding, or liver
disorder caused by blocked blood vessels. The transplant may be rejected by the recipient’s immune system,
or the donor bone marrow may launch an immunemediated attack against the recipient’s tissues. This
complication is called acute graft versus host disease,
and it can be a life-threatening condition. Characteristic
signs of the disease include fever, rash, diarrhea, liver
problems, and a compromised immune system.
618

Approximately 25–50% of bone marrow transplant recipients develop long-term complications.
Chronic graft versus host disease symptoms include
skin changes such as dryness, altered pigmentation,
and thickening; abnormal liver function tests;
dry mouth and eyes; infections; and weight loss.
Other long-term complications include cataracts (due
to radiation treatment), abnormal lung function, hormonal abnormalities resulting in reduced growth or
hypothyroidism, secondary cancers, and infertility.

Normal results
In a successful bone marrow transplant, the
donor’s marrow migrates to the cavities in the recipient’s bones and produces normal numbers of healthy
blood cells. Bone marrow transplants can extend a
person’s life, improve quality of life, and may aid in
curing the underlying ailment.
In autologous bone marrow transplantation, stem
cells are collected from the patient. Once the patient has
undergone chemotherapy, the cells are replaced in the
blood via an intravenous catheter. The cells return to the
bone marrow and begin producing healthy new cells.

KEY TERMS
Radioisotope—A radioactive, or radiation-emitting
form, of an element.
Radionuclide—A substance which emits radiation

Purpose
Bone scans are most frequently ordered to check
whether a cancer that originated elsewhere has spread
to the bones. Cancers that begin in the breasts,
kidneys, lungs, prostate, thyroid, or urinary bladder
are most likely to spread, or metastasize, to the bones.
If metastases are found, periodic bone scans may be
ordered to see if therapy is effective against a cancer.
Some cancers arise in bone. These are called primary bone cancers. When an abnormality is found on
an x ray of a bone, a bone scan may be helpful in
deciding if it is a primary bone cancer, or a non-cancerous (benign) condition.
Infection in the bone (osteomyelitis) can be
detected or confirmed by a bone scan, often days or
weeks before an x ray would reveal it. Bone scans are
useful in diagnosing early arthritic changes, and monitoring both the progression of the disease and the
effectiveness of treatment. Unexplained pain may be
evaluated with a bone scan, because it can demonstrate fractures that are difficult to detect on x ray.
Bone scans can be used to see if artificial joints have
loosened or become infected. Suspected child abuse
may be evaluated with a bone scan, due to its ability
to show an overall pattern of repeated trauma.
Abnormalities caused by altered circulation to the
bone may be diagnosed with a bone scan.

Precautions
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should
not have this test. A patient who is unable to remain
still for an extended period of time may require sedation for a bone scan.

Bone nuclear medicine scan

waits from three to four hours, for the substance to
collect within the skeletal system. During this time, he
or she will be instructed to drink several glasses of
water. Patients are free to get up and move around as
they desire during this waiting time, and should urinate frequently. Just before the scanning begins, the
patient should empty his or her bladder again. This
ensures that a lot of radioactive material is not concentrated in the urinary bladder, which could obscure
part of the pelvic bones.
During the scan, the patient lies on his or her back
on a table, but may be repositioned to the stomach or
side during the study. It is important for the patient not
to move, except when directed to by the technologist.
The radionuclide scanner, sometimes called a
gamma camera, or scintillation camera, is positioned
against the body part to be examined. Either the camera, the table, or both, may change position during
the study. For a total body bone scan, the patient is
scanned from head to foot, over a period of 30-60
minutes. Patients should experience no discomfort
from this examination.
A special kind of bone scan, called a SPECT
(Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography)
scan may be added, to study a particular part of the
body in more detail. Suspected diseases of the hips,
lower back, or jaw are often evaluated using this study.
It usually takes an additional 30-45 minutes. The camera circles completely around the area in question or
multiple cameras are used to create a cross-sectional
image. This helps pinpoint the location of the abnormality being evaluated.
The bone scan might be done in phases. The procedure is the same, except the scanning takes place
immediately after the radioactive substance is injected,
then again at set intervals to image how the radioactive
tracer pools and distributes in the body and bone. For
example, a two-phase bone scan for osteomyelitis may
involve a scan about five minutes after injection, then
about three hours later.

radionuclide scanner does not emit any radiation at all,
but detects and records it from the patient.

Aftercare
Fluids are encouraged after the scan to aid in the
excretion of the radioisotope. It is almost completely
eliminated from the body within 24 hours. However,
since increased airport security methods resulting from
the September 11, 2001 attacks, isolated cases of people
who have had recent diagnostic nuclear medicine procedures setting off airport security systems have
occurred. One state’s Homeland Security Department
has warned people having nuclear medicine procedures
and flying soon afterward to bring adequate documentation of the procedure along to the airport.

Normal results
The normal appearance of the scan will vary
according to the patient’s age. In general, a uniform
concentration of radionuclide uptake is present in all
bones in a normal scan.

Abnormal results
A high concentration of radionuclide occurs in
areas of increased bone activity. These regions appear
brighter and may be referred to as ‘‘hot spots.’’ They
may indicate healing fractures, tumors, infections, or
other processes that trigger new bone formation. Lower
concentrations of radionuclide may be called ‘‘cold
spots.’’ Poor blood flow to an area of bone, or bone
destruction from a tumor may produce a cold spot.
The bone scan is a very sensitive test and can detect
subtle conditions more readily than other studies.
However, it is not a very specific examination, and
often cannot distinguish exactly what disease process
is causing an abnormality. Results need to be correlated
with the patient’s medical history, and other radiologic
and laboratory studies to make a definite diagnosis.

Definition
Bone x rays are a diagnostic test in which ionizing
radiation passing through the bones being examined
enables an image to be produced on film.

Purpose
Bone x rays are ordered to detect disease or injury
to the bone such as broken bones, tumors, and other
problems. They can determine bone density, texture,
erosion, and changes in bone relationships. Bone x rays
also evaluate the joints for diseases such as osteoarthritis.

Precautions
Precautions should be taken to protect patients
from unnecessary exposure to radiation. Patients should
be shielded with lead aprons as much as possible.
Women of childbearing age who could be pregnant
should not have x rays of their trunk or pelvic regions.
The fetus is especially at risk during the first trimester of
pregnancy. Women who are pregnant should not have x
rays of their pelvic region, lumbar spine, and abdomen
unless absolutely necessary. If other types of x rays are
necessary, a lead apron should be used to shield the
abdominal and pelvic regions.

Description
X rays are a common diagnostic test in which a
form of energy called x-ray radiation penetrates the
patient’s body. In bone x rays, electrical current passes
through an x-ray tube and produces a beam of ionizing
radiation that passes through the bone(s) being examined. This produces a picture of the inside of the body
on film. The physician reads the developed x ray on a
wall-mounted light box.
Digital x rays are a new type of x ray in which
conventional equipment is used to take the x ray but
the image is produced via computer. In a digital x ray,
the image is created on a reusable plate. After being
read by a laser reader, the information is sent in digital
form to a storage unit connected to a computer network
from which the radiologist reads the image. An electronic report can then be sent to the patient’s physician.
Problems with bones that x rays can detect result
from injury or from disease caused by a malfunction in
the patient’s bone chemistry. Bone injuries, especially
broken bones (fractures), are common and can be
accurately diagnosed by bone x rays. X rays are

especially helpful in diagnosing simple and incomplete
fractures that can’t be detected during a physical
examination. X rays can also be used to check for
bone position in a fracture. Some bone diseases can
be definitively diagnosed with bone x rays while others
require additional tests.
Osteoporosis, a common bone disease, can be
detected in bone x rays but other tests are then ordered
to determine the extent of the disease. For osteomalacia and rickets, a blood test and x rays of the affected
bone are usually definitive; in some cases a bone biopsy
(microscopic analysis of a small amount of tissue) is
also done. In a rare bone disease called Paget’s disease,
x rays may be used in conjunction with bone, blood,
and urine tests to make a diagnosis. In another rare
bone disease, fibrous dysplasia, bone x rays or a bone
biopsy (microscopic analysis of a small amount of
tissue) are used to confirm the diagnosis. Bone x rays
are definitive in diagnosing osteogenesis imperfecta.
For osteomyelitis, bone x rays are used in conjunction
with a blood test, bone scan, or needle biopsy to make
the diagnosis. For arthritis, x rays of the bone are
occasionally used in conjunction with blood tests.
For bone tumors, bone x rays are helpful but they
may not be definitive.
Bone x rays are performed by a technologist, and
interpreted by a radiologist. They are taken in a physician’s office, radiology department, outpatient clinic, or
diagnostic clinic. Bone x rays generally take less than

10 minutes. There is no pain or discomfort associated
with the test, but some people find it difficult to remain
still. The results are often available in minutes.
During the test, the patient lies on a table. The
technologist taking the x ray will check the patient’s
positioning and place the x-ray machine over the part
of the body being examined. After asking the patient
to remain motionless, he or she steps out of the area
and presses a button to take the picture.

Preparation
The patient is asked to remove clothing, jewelry,
and any other metal objects from the area being x rayed.
If appropriate, a lead shield will be placed over other
body parts to minimize exposure to radiation.

Aftercare
The patient can immediately resume normal
activities.

Risks
The human body contains some natural radiation and is also exposed to radiation in the environment. There is a slight risk from exposure to radiation
during bone x rays, however, the amount of radiation
is small and the risk of harm is very low. If reproductive organs are exposed to radiation, genetic
alterations may occur. Excessive or repeated doses
of radiation can cause changes in other types of
body tissue. No radiation remains in the body after
the x ray.

Normal results
Normal bones show no fractures, dislocations, or
other abnormalities.

Abnormal results
Results that indicate the presence of bone injury
or disease differ in appearance according to the nature
of the injury/disease. For example, fractures show up
as clear breaks in the bones, while osteoporotic bone
has the same shape as a normal bone on an x ray but is
less dense. Even though a bone x ray may not show
definite results, it often is the first imaging choice, to be
followed up by another imaging technique such as
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Bone x rays are

I Botulinum toxin injections
Definition
Botulinum is a bacterium (Clostridium botulinum)
that produces seven different toxins that can cause
botulism and is also medically used to block muscle
contractions.

Purpose
Botulinum toxin (Botox) injection is used in
conditions of excessive and inappropriate muscle
contraction, spasticity (persistent states of muscle
contraction), sphincter contraction, eye-movement
disorders, tics and tremors, and cosmetically to
treat facial lines and wrinkles. The FDA approved
Botox for treating excessive underarm sweating in
2004.
Botox has also been used in the treatment of
chronic muscle tension and migraine headaches. The
relief is likely due to the decrease in localized muscle
spasms, as no direct effect of Botox on the sensory
nerves has been established. Researchers in New
Zealand were testing Botox as means to help improve
movement in children with a form of cerebral palsy
called hemiplegia in 2004. The application of the therapy seems to be growing continuously beyond its more
popularly known cosmetic uses.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Antibodies—A protein developed in response to
the presence of a foreign substance.
Immunoresistance—The presence of circulating
antibodies.
Neuromuscular junction—Interface between
motor nerve ending and muscle tissue.
Serotype—Microorganisms differing in the type of
surface antigens.
Antigen—A foreign substance inducing an antibody response within the body.

Precautions
Botulinum toxin is produced from the bacterium
that causes food poisoning in humans. High doses of
the toxin can be fatal; however, doses administered
therapeutically are so small that harmful effects are
uncommon.

Description
The number of potential applications for botulinum toxin extends to every muscle group. The first
therapeutic use of Botox was in the treatment of
strabismus (eyes are unable to direct toward the same
object) and since then it has been used to treat a variety
of involuntary muscle contractions or disorders. Its
cosmetic use is the result of treatment for facial spasms
where smoothing of facial lines was reported by
patients. In general, 90% of injections for facial
spasms are resolved satisfactorily.
Toxin type A has a duration of effect that lasts
approximately three months and is the therapeutic
agent of choice for most conditions.

Preparation
The dosage of Botox must be monitored and
adjusted, with multiple injections showing a lower
incidence of complications versus administration by
one larger dose.

Risks
In over 30 years of therapeutic use in humans,
botulinum toxin has proven to be remarkably safe.
Difficulties associated with administration of toxin
are: different patients may experience different effects
at the same dose, patients new to the treatment may
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

experience exaggerated effects at subsequent visits
and/or neighboring muscles may become activated at
subsequent treatments. Patients should ask about
their provider s experience with injecting Botox before
proceeding with the procedure.
Additional side effects may include excessive muscle weakness at the injection site or adjacent muscles.
These effects typically resolve quickly. Occasionally,
patients report flu-like symptoms but they are usually
self-limited.
A certain percentage of patients may also experience resistance to the toxin. The presence of circulating antibodies to the toxin is presumed to be the
primary reason for resistance to Botox injections.
Patients who have little reaction to Botox ‘A’ may
benefit from injections using one of the other six
serotypes. Using the smallest effective dose limits the
likelihood of immunoresistance in unresponsive
patients.

Normal results
The anticipated outcome of Botox injections is
relaxation of the target muscle tissue. The pharmacological effects of botulinum toxin are typically isolated
to local areas and do not result in tissue destruction or
prolonged paralysis. Varying the dose can deliver a
precise amount of toxin to achieve graded degrees of
paralysis for the desired level of response.

Abnormal results
Most side effects, such as weakness in the injected
muscle or overall muscle soreness, will go away
quickly. Some patients have received too much of the
substance when having Botox for cosmetic purposes
and have been unhappy with the results. Physicians
and patients should discuss the procedure and the
amount to be used. Many clinicians believe that it is
best to err on the side of low dosage with a return trip
for more, rather than too high a dosage that might
result in unwanted cosmetic effects.

Botulism

Definition
Botulism is caused by botulinum toxin, a natural
poison produced by certain bacteria in the Clostridium
genus. Exposure to the botulinum toxin occurs mostly
from eating contaminated food, or in infants, from
certain clostridia growing in the intestine. Botulinum
toxin blocks motor nerves’ ability to release acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter that relays nerve signals to
muscles, and flaccid paralysis occurs. As botulism
progresses, the muscles that control the airway and
breathing fail.

Description
Botulism occurs rarely, but it causes concern
because of its high fatality rate. Clinical descriptions
of botulism possibly reach as far back in history as
ancient Rome and Greece. However, the relationship
between contaminated food and botulism wasn’t
defined until the late 1700s. In 1793 the German physician, Justinius Kerner, deduced that a substance in
spoiled sausages, which he called wurstgift (German
for sausage poison), caused botulism. The toxin’s origin
and identity remained elusive until Emile von
Ermengem, a Belgian professor, isolated Clostridium
botulinum in 1895 and identified it as the poison source.
Three types of botulism have been identified: foodborne, wound, and infant botulism. The main difference between types hinges on the route of exposure to
the toxin. In the United States, there are approximately
110 cases of botulism reported annually. Food-borne
botulism accounts for 25% of all botulism cases and
624

usually can be traced to eating contaminated homepreserved food. Infant botulism accounts for 72% of
all cases, but the recovery rate is good (about 98%)
with proper treatment. From 1990 to 2000, 263 cases of
food-borne cases were reported in the United States,
most of them in Alaska. Though most were related to
home canning, two restaurant-associated outbreaks
affected 25 people.
Though domestic food poisoning is a problem
world-wide, there has been a growing concern regarding the use of botulism toxin in biological warfare and
terrorist acts. The Iraqi government admitted in 1995
that it had loaded 11,200 liters of botulinum toxin into
SCUD missiles during the Gulf War. Luckily, these
special missiles were never used. As of 1999, there
were 17 countries known to be developing biological
weapons, including the culture of botulism toxins.

Causes and symptoms
Toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum is the main culprit in botulism. Other members of
the clostridium genus can produce botulinum toxin,
namely C. argentinense, C. butyricum, and C. baratii,
but they are minor sources. To grow, these bacteria
require a low-acid, oxygen-free environment that is
warm (40-120  F or 4.4–48.8  C) and moist. Lacking
these conditions, the bacteria transform themselves into
spores that, like plant seeds, can remain dormant for
years. Clostridia and their spores exist all over the world,
especially in soil and aquatic sediments. They do not
threaten human or animal health until the spores
encounter an environment that favors growth. The
spores then germinate, and the growing bacteria produce
the deadly botulism toxin.
Scientists have discovered that clostridia can produce at least seven types of botulism toxin, identified
as A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Humans are usually
affected by A, B, E, and very rarely F. Domesticated
animals such as dogs, cattle, and mink are affected by
botulism C toxin, which also affects birds and has
caused massive die-offs in domestic bird flocks and
wild waterfowl. Botulism D toxin can cause illness in
cattle, and horses succumb to botulism A, B, and C
toxin. There have been no confirmed human or animal
botulism cases linked to the G toxin.
In humans, botulinum toxin latches onto specific
proteins in nerve endings and irreversibly destroys
them. These proteins control the release of acetylcholine,
a neurotransmitter that stimulates muscle cells. With
acetylcholine release blocked, nerves are not able to stimulate muscles. Ironically, botulinum toxin has found a
beneficial niche in the world of medicine due to this

muscle is partially paralyzed and normal movement is
retained. This is commonly referred to as Botox injection.
The three types of human botulism include the
following symptoms:


Food-borne. Food that has been improperly preserved or stored can harbor botulinum toxin-producing
clostridia. Botulism symptoms typically appear within
18-36 hours of eating contaminated food, with
extremes of four hours to eight days. Initial symptoms
include blurred or double vision and difficulty swallowing and speaking. Possible gastrointestinal problems
include constipation, nausea, and vomiting. As botulism
progresses, the victim experiences weakness or paralysis, starting with the head muscles and progressing
down the body. Breathing becomes increasingly difficult. Without medical care, respiratory failure and death
are very likely.



Infant. Infant botulism was first described in 1976.
Unlike adults, infants younger than 12 months are
vulnerable to C. botulinum colonizing the intestine.
Infants ingest spores in honey or simply by swallowing spore-containing dust. The spores germinate in
the large intestine and, as the bacteria grow, they
produce botulinum toxin that is absorbed into the
infant’s body. The first symptoms include constipation, lethargy, and poor feeding. As infant botulism
progresses, sucking and swallowing (thus eating)
become difficult. A nursing mother will often notice
breast engorgement as the first sign of her infant’s
illness. The baby suffers overall weakness and cannot
control head movements. Because of the flaccid
paralysis of the muscles, the baby appears ‘‘floppy.’’
Breathing is impaired, and death from respiratory
failure is a very real danger.



Wound. Confirmed cases of wound botulism have
been linked to trauma such as severe crush injuries to
the extremities, surgery, and illegal drug use. Wound
botulism occurs when clostridia colonize an infected
wound and produce botulinum toxin. The symptoms
usually appear four to 18 days after an injury occurs
and are similar to food-borne botulism, although
gastrointestinal symptoms may be absent.

CT scan—The abbreviated term for computed or
computerized axial tomography. The test may involve
injecting a radioactive contrast into the body.
Computers are used to scan for radiation and create
cross-sectional images of internal organs.
Electromyographic test—A medical test which
determines if a muscle’s response to electrical stimuli. The test results allow medical personnel to
assess how nerves to the muscle are functioning.
Flaccid paralysis—Paralysis characterized by limp,
unresponsive muscles.
Lumbar puncture—A procedure in which a small
amount of cerebrospinal fluid is removed from the
lower spine. Examination of this fluid helps diagnose certain illnesses.
MRI—The abbreviated term for magnetic resonance imaging. MRI uses a large circular magnet
and radio waves to generate signals from atoms
in the body. These signals are used to construct
images of internal structures.
Neurotransmitter—A chemical found in nerves that
relays nerve signals to other cells. Acetylcholine is a
neurotransmitter.
Sepsis—The presence of infection-causing organisms or associated toxins in the blood or within
body tissues.
Spores—A state of ‘‘suspended animation’’ that
some bacteria can adopt when conditions are not
ideal for growth. Spores are analogous to plant
seeds and can germinate into growing bacteria
when conditions are right.
Toxin—A poisonous substance produced by a
microorganism, plant, or animal.

hole in the neck to the trachea, or windpipe. It is
sometimes used in conjunction with a respirator.

involuntary and uncontrollable muscle contractions.

muscles inhibits excessive muscle contractions. The

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of botulism can be tricky because symptoms mimic those presented by other diseases. Botulism
may be confused with Guillain-Barre syndrome,
myasthenia gravis, drug reactions, stroke, or nervous
system infection, intoxications (e.g. carbon monoxide
or atropine), or shellfish poisoning. Sepsis is the most
common initial diagnosis for infant botulism. Failure to
thrive may also be suspected. Some reports have linked

Botulism

KEY TERMS

Botulism

infant botulism to 5-15% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS, crib death) cases. Laboratory tests are
used for definitive diagnosis, but if botulism seems
likely, treatment starts immediately.
While waiting for laboratory results, doctors ask
about recently consumed food and work to dismiss
other disease possibilities. A physical examination is
done with an emphasis on the nervous system. As part
of this examination, CT scans, MRIs, electromyographic tests, or lumbar punctures may be ordered.
Laboratory tests involve testing a suspected food and/
or the patient’s serum, feces, or other specimens for
traces of botulinum toxin or clostridia.

Treatment
Drugs
Adults with botulism are treated with an antitoxin
derived from horse serum that is distributed by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The antitoxin (effective against toxin types A, B, and E) inactivates only the botulinum toxin that is unattached to
nerve endings. Early injection of antitoxin (usually
within 24 hours of onset of symptoms) can preserve
nerve endings, prevent progression of the disease, and
reduce mortality.
Infants, however, cannot receive the antitoxin
used for adults. For them, human botulism immune
globulin (BIG) is available in the United States
through the Infant Botulism Treatment and
Prevention Program in Berkeley, California. BIG neutralizes toxin types A, B, C, D, and E before they can
bind to nerves. This antitoxin can provide protection
against A and B toxins for approximately four
months. Though many infants recover with supportive care, BIG cuts hospital stay in half, and therefore
reduces hospital costs by 50% as well.
Aside from antitoxin, no drugs are used to treat
botulism. Antibiotics are not effective for preventing
or treating botulism. In fact, antibiotic use is discouraged for infants because dying bacteria could potentially release more toxin into a baby’s system.
Antibiotics can be used, however, to treat secondary
respiratory tract and other infections.
Respiratory support
Treatment for infants usually involves intensive
respiratory support and tube feeding for weeks or
even months. Once an infant can breathe unaided,
physical therapy is initiated to help the child relearn
how to suck and swallow. A respirator is often required
to help adult patients breathe, and a tracheostomy may
also be necessary.
626

Surgery
Surgery may be necessary to clean an infected
wound and remove the source of the bacteria that is
producing the toxin. Antimicrobial therapy may be
necessary.
Gastric lavage
When botulism is caused by food, it often is necessary to flush the gastrointestinal tract (gastric lavage).
Often cathartic agents or enemas are used. It is important to avoid products that contain magnesium,
since magnesium enhances the effect of the toxin.

Prognosis
With medical intervention, botulism victims can
recover completely, though slowly. It takes weeks to
months to recover from botulism, and severe cases
can take years before a total recovery is attained.
Recovery depends on the nerve endings building
new proteins to replace those destroyed by botulinum
toxin.

Prevention
Vaccines against botulism do not exist to prevent infant botulism or other forms of the disease.
However, scientists announced in 2004 that they
had successfully vaccinated mice and ducks against
type C and D, which may help lead to vaccines for
humans. Food safety is the surest prevention for botulism. Botulinum toxin cannot be seen, smelled, or
tasted, so the wisest course is to discard any food that
seems spoiled without tasting it. Home canners must be
diligent about using sterile equipment and following
U.S. Department of Agriculture canning guidelines. If
any part of a canned food container is rusty or bulging,
the food should not be eaten. Infant botulism is difficult to prevent, because controlling what goes into an
infant’s mouth is often beyond control, especially in
regard to spores in the air. One concrete preventive is
to never feed honey to infants younger than 12 months
since it is one known source of botulism spores. As
infants begin eating solid foods, the same food precautions should be followed as for adults.

I Bowel preparation
Definition
Bowel preparation is a procedure usually undertaken before a diagnostic procedure or treatment can be
initiated for certain colorectal diseases. Bowel preparation is a cleansing of the intestines from fecal matter and
secretions.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely recommended. In some cases of prosthetic heart valves,
antibiotics can be prescribed. Evidence exists that
evacuation of intestinal waste products in conjunction
with antibiotics before (prophylactic) the procedure
reduces the possibility of sepsis (infection which
spreads from the primary site to blood).

Description
Purpose
The ultimate goal of bowel preparation is to empty
and cleanse the bowel for a diagnostic procedure (using
x rays to detect a disease process in the intestines) or for
surgical intervention (such as removal of polyps, cancer,
or narrowing of the intestinal diameter). Colonoscopy is
an effective treatment procedure for polyps (a growing
mass of tissue). This procedure enables the doctor to
visualize the entire large bowel. During a colonoscopy,
polyps can be cauterized (applying an electric current
which incinerates the polyp). The procedure can be both
diagnostic and therapeutic. A sigmoidoscopy scope is a
flexible tube that allows clinicians to view the sigmoid
colon (the part of the large intestine before the rectum).
This procedure is important for detection of colorectal
cancer. It is safe, quick to perform (usually 30–45 minutes in about 90% of cases), and an effective diagnostic
tool for evaluation of:

The bowel is emptied of any contents for such
procedures as barium enema (introducing a compound
containing barium to promote better visualization of
intestines during x rays) or colonoscopy. Preparation of
the bowel distally—from the rectum—is necessary for
such diagnostic procedures as sigmoidoscopy. Bowel
emptying is done through taking oral laxative solutions
that speed up the excretion of the contents of the lower
bowel together with restrictions on solid food intake.
A newer type of imaging study may eventually
make current laxative methods of bowel preparation
obsolete. According to a group of researchers in the
United Kingdom, computed tomography (CT) colonography (sometimes called virtual colonoscopy) has
shown itself to be as accurate in diagnosing colorectal
tumors as optical colonoscopy. CT colonography
allows a radiologist to examine the colon and nearby
organs in less than 30 seconds.

bisacodyl tablets. One of these preparations should be
administered starting at 4:00 p.m. the day before the
procedure. Patients are usually asked to avoid solid
foods for about 36 hours before diagnostic procedures.
Such clear liquids as vegetable or beef broth, apple or
white grape juice, soda pop or fruit-flavored gelatin are
permitted, although some doctors ask patients to avoid
red-colored beverages or gelatin flavors on the grounds
that the red food coloring in these products may make
bleeding more difficult to detect.
In most cases, patients may continue to take other
prescription medications at the usual times while they
are restricted to clear liquids. It is a good idea, however, to check with the doctor beforehand.

Aftercare
Patients should have a friend or relative to drive
them home after the procedure, as the combination of
a period of dietary restriction, frequent bowel movements, and the procedure itself leaves most people
feeling tired and slightly weak. Many doctors advise
patients to postpone vigorous physical activity or
work requiring mental concentration until the day
after the procedure. Patients can resume eating solid
foods as soon as they get home.
Some patients may notice a small amount of blood
on toilet tissue or underwear following a colonoscopy
or other examination of the lower digestive tract.
Spotting is not cause for concern; however, patients
who have steady or heavy bleeding from the rectum
should call their doctor as soon as possible.

Risks
The current standard of care dictates that patients
receive antibiotic prophylaxis if they are at increased risk
of developing an infection. High-risk patients include
those with cardiac diseases or patients with prostheses.
Bowel preparation can be stressful for some
patients, particularly those with pre-existing nutritional problems associated with cancer treatment or
malabsorption. In addition, many patients find the
various oral solutions unpleasant to the taste and
difficult to swallow for that reason. According to one
British study, oral solutions flavored with lemon are
more acceptable to patients than unflavored forms.
Both Colyte and Phospho-Soda are available with
flavoring added; patients may wish to ask their pharmacist for these specific products. Mild nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, intestinal gas, dry mouth, and
increased thirst are common side effects of these products. Some patients are helped by taking an electrolyte
628

supplement along with oral sodium phosphate solution to lower the risk of dehydration.
Some people may have severe allergic reactions
to commonly used oral laxatives used for bowel preparation. Patients who develop hives, swelling of the
face or hands, swelling or tingling in the throat or
mouth, difficulty breathing, or tightness in the chest
should call their doctor at once. This type of reaction is
a medical emergency.

Normal results
Absence of anatomical changes or abnormalities
in the intestines would result in normal diagnosis.

Abnormal results
Polyps can be treated with electrocautery. A
biopsy is taken of any suspicious polyps and further
analyzed. Sigmoidoscopy can detect masses, bleeding,
and ulcerative disease.

x ray after the patient has swallowed a contrast
(dye) substance.

A bowel resection is a surgical procedure in which
a part of the large or small intestine is removed.

Embolism—Blockage of a blood vessel by any small
piece of material traveling in the blood. The emboli
may be caused by germs, air, blood clots, or fat.
Ischemia—A compromise in blood supply to body
tissues that causes tissue damage or death.

Purpose
Bowel resection may be performed to treat various disorders of the intestine, including cancer,
obstruction, inflammatory bowel disease, ruptured
diverticulum, ischemia (compromised blood supply),
or traumatic injury.

Ostomy—A surgically-created opening in the abdomen for elimination of waste products (urine or stool).

Description
The preferred type of bowel resection involves
removal of the diseased portion of intestine, and surgically re-joining the remaining ends. In this procedure, the continuity of the bowel is maintained and
normal passage of stool is preserved. When deemed
necessary by the surgeon, the diseased portion of the
bowel may be removed, and the functioning end of
the intestine may be brought out onto the surface of
the abdomen, forming an temporary or permanent
ostomy. Use of the large intestine to form the ostomy
results in a colostomy; use of small intestine to form the
ostomy results in an ileostomy.

Preparation
As with any surgical procedure, the patient will be
required to sign a consent form after the procedure is
explained thoroughly. Blood and urine studies, along
with various x rays and an electrocardiogram (EKG)
may be ordered as the doctor deems necessary. In
order to empty and cleanse the bowel, the patient
may be placed on a low residue diet for several days
prior to surgery. A liquid diet may be ordered for at
least the day before surgery, with nothing taken by
mouth after midnight. A series of enemas and/or oral
preparations (GoLytely or Colyte), may be ordered to
empty the bowel of stool. Oral anti-infectives (neomycin, erythromycin, or kanamycin sulfate) may be
ordered to decrease bacteria in the intestine and help
prevent post-operative infection. A nasogastric tube is
inserted through the nose into the stomach on the day
of surgery or during surgery. This removes the gastric
secretions and prevents nausea and vomiting. A urinary
catheter (thin tube inserted into the bladder) may also
be inserted to keep the bladder empty during surgery,
giving more space in the surgical field and decreasing
chances of accidental injury.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Aftercare
Post-operative care for the patient who has had a
bowel resection, as with those who have had any major
surgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse,
respirations, and temperature. Breathing tends to be
shallow because of the effect of anesthesia and the
patient’s reluctance to breathe deeply and experience
pain that is caused by the abdominal incision. The
patient is instructed how to support the operative site
during deep breathing and coughing, and is given pain
medication as necessary. Fluid intake and output is
measured, and the operative site is observed for color
and amount of wound drainage. The nasogastric tube
will remain in place, attached to low intermittent suction until bowel activity resumes. Fluids and electrolytes are infused intravenously until the patient’s diet
can gradually be resumed, beginning with liquids and
advancing to a regular diet as tolerated. The patient is
generally out of bed approximately eight to 24 hours
after surgery. Postoperative weight loss follows almost
all bowel resections. Weight and strength are slowly
regained over a period of months.

Risks
Potential complications of this abdominal surgery
include:


excessive bleeding



surgical wound infection



incisional hernia (An organ projects through the
muscle wall that surrounds it. The hernia occurs
through the surgical scar.)

KEY TERMS
Defecate—To pass feces (stool) out of the rectum
through the anus.
Diverticulitis—Infection of outpouchings in the
large bowel.

Normal results
Complete healing is expected without complications after bowel resection. The period of time
required for recovery from the surgery may vary
depending of the patient’s overall health status prior
to surgery.

Fecal impaction—Obstruction of the rectum by a
large mass of feces (stool).
Hiatal hernia—Part of the stomach displaced
through the diaphragm into the chest.

Abnormal results
The doctor should be made aware of any of the
following problems after surgery:


increased pain, swelling, redness, drainage, or bleeding in the surgical area



headache, muscle aches, dizziness, fever



increased abdominal pain or swelling, constipation, nausea or vomiting, rectal bleeding, or black, tarry stools

habits not only improve the quality of life, they help
prevent several common diseases–for example, diverticulitis and fecal impaction. Gall stones, appendicitis,
colon cancer, hiatal hernia, diabetes, and heart disease
have also been related to the quality of bowel movements and the foods that affect them.


One of the most common causes of constipation is
the laxative habit. Repeated artificial stimulation of
the bowels destroys their natural emptying reflex, so
that they will no longer move without artificial stimulants. The laxative habit begins innocently
enough with the correct belief that bowels should
move every day, however, laxatives will cause the
evacuation of several days worth of stool in a single
movement. Impatient for stool to reaccumulate for
the necessary few days, the patient takes another
laxative, and the cycle begins.



The other major cause of constipation is a diet with
insufficient bulk or roughage. The bowel works more
smoothly the more contents it has. Western diets of
highly refined foods have eliminated most of the
residue from food. The result is that most food is
absorbed, leaving little to pass through and be
excreted as feces.



Constipation occurs acutely with impaction–the presence in the rectum of a mass of feces too large to
pass. Fecal impaction is usually the result of poor
bowel habits, a diet with too little liquid and roughage, and inadequate physical activity.



Diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, can disrupt the
bowel’s normal rhythm and lead to irregularity.



Several diseases of the nervous system affect bowel
reflexes.

I Bowel training
Definition
Bowel training helps to reestablish normal bowel
movements in persons who suffer from constipation,
diarrhea, incontinence, or irregularity. Healthy bowel
activity is considered one or two movements of moderate size every day.

Purpose
Many people for many reasons have irregular
bowel function. In some cases, the irregularity lasts
beyond the condition that caused it. The bowels by
themselves develop bad habits that can be retrained
with suitable exercises and education. Normal bowel

Description
Bowel training reestablishes the bowel’s normal
reflexes by repeating a routine until it becomes a habit.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

After gaining the patient’s cooperation, the next
step is to optimize the diet. Healthy bowel movements
require ingestion of a large amount of liquids and bulk
foods. The patient should drink two to three quarts of
liquids every day, with liberal inclusion of prune juice
and perhaps coffee for their natural laxative effect. Bulk
comes from unrefined foods. Oat bran, wheat bran,
brown rice, green vegetables, apples, and pears are a
few examples of high residue foods. Many patients will
benefit from adding bulk preparations of psyllium.
Constipating foods like bananas and cheese should be
avoided until a natural rhythm is well established.
To assure that stools are soft enough to pass easily,
it is a good idea to add a pure stool softener like DOSS
(dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate), two to four per day as
needed. DOSS also helps prevent impaction.
There is usually a time of day when bowel movements are more likely to occur. In anticipation of this
time, the patient should participate in activities that
stimulate a normal bowel movement. Walking, eating
unrefined foods, and drinking prune juice or coffee,
encourage natural evacuation. It is acceptable to use
lubricants such as glycerine suppositories or oil enemas at this time. For severe constipation, water enemas may be needed to initiate a movement.
It is also important for the patient to recognize the
urge to defecate and to respond right away to that
urge. The longer stool sits in the rectum, the more
water the rectum will absorb from it, making it harder
and more difficult to pass.

Normal results
With patience and diligence, normal bowel habits
and the health that comes with them will return in
most patients.

I Brain abscess
Definition
Brain abscess is a bacterial infection within the
brain.

Description
The brain is usually well insulated from infection
by bacteria, protected by the skull, the meninges (tissue layers surrounding the brain), the immune system,
and the highly regulated barrier between the bloodstream and the brain. Under certain circumstances,
however, bacteria can invade the brain and cause a
localized infection called an abscess. Brain abscess is
relatively rare, accounting for 1 in 10,000 hospital
admissions. Single abscess occurs in 75% of cases,
and the remainder of cases involve multiple abscesses.
If not treated, brain abscess is almost always fatal.

Causes and symptoms
One-half of all brain abscesses are caused by the
spread of bacteria from a nearby infection. Sources of
bacteria include:


middle ear infections (otitis media) or infections in the
bony spaces in front of the middle ear (mastoiditis)



sinus infections



an abscessed tooth.

Other sources of bacteria include lung infections,
abdominal infection, infection of the heart’s lining (endocarditis) penetrating heart wounds, and neurosurgery.
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)
or the presence of another immune deficiency greatly
increases the risk of brain abscess. Approximately
25% of cases have no detectable cause of infection.
Brain abscess can be caused by a variety of organisms, many of them related to ear and sinus infections.
Many times brain abscess cases are caused by two or
more bacteria. In 30–60% of cases, the bacteria
combination includes streptococci, microorganisms
that can live without oxygen (anaerobes), and enterobacteria. A small number of cases are caused by
yeast, fungi, and single-cell organisms (protozoa).
The symptoms of brain abscess often develop
slowly, usually within a period of about two weeks.
The most common symptoms are:


headache



neurologic symptoms related to the specific part of
the brain that is infected
631

Brain abscess

Naturally the patient must be able and willing to
cooperate. Some patients are so convinced they need
daily laxatives that they are afraid to do without them.
It takes time for a changed diet to effect the bowels and
for the bowel to regain its normal rhythm. Trust and
patience are necessary.

Brain biopsy

KEY TERMS
Biopsy—The removal of a tissue sample for
examination.
Aspiration—Removal of fluid from a closed space
through a needle.



altered mental status



seizures

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of brain abscess is performed by using
a computed tomography scan (CT) or a magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scan to determine the site of
infection. Tissue removal (biopsy) is usually performed
as well. A biopsy is performed to determine the type of
bacterium involved. Biopsies can also be used to rule
out tumor or other noninfectious localized lesions,
which may look the same on the scans.
Other tests are performed to determine the source
of the infection. These tests include blood cultures,
x rays of the chest, and a physical exam of the ears,
sinuses, and teeth. A test for human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) is usually also performed.

Treatment
Treatment for brain abscess begins with intravenous antibiotics, chosen to match the infecting bacterium if known, or to cover a wide spectrum of
possibilities if not. Treatment usually continues for
six to eight weeks.
Aspiration surgery is almost always done to drain
the abscess. In this procedure, a needle is guided to the
infected site by CT scan, and fluid is removed (aspirated) from the abscess. Aspiration may be repeated
several times until the bacteria are completely killed or
removed. Surgical removal of infected or dead tissue
may be needed in some cases. For patients with many
sites of infection, aspiration or surgical removal is not
done because of the increased difficulty and risk of the
procedure. For these patients, antibiotic therapy alone
is used. Steroid treatment is controversial, but may be
indicated in some cases.

survive have some residual neurological problems,
including seizures in many patients.
There are several reasons why patients with brain
abscess can have a poor prognosis. The illness may
not be diagnosed correctly or an accurate diagnosis
may take additional time. The patient may receive an
antibiotic that does not match the infecting organism. Sometimes the infection may not be limited to a
definite area in the brain, making diagnosis and treatment difficult. The small number of cases caused by
fungal infection may take additional time to diagnose. A patient may also have a poor prognosis
because there is more than one abscess, the location
of the abscess may be deep within the brain, or the
infection may have moved into many locations within
the brain. Severe complications can result from
brain abscess, including comma and brain rupture.
In 80-100% of cases involving brain rupture, the
patient dies.

Prevention
Brain abscess may be preventable by prompt and
aggressive treatment of the infections which give rise
to it, especially sinus and ear infections.

Alzheimer’s disease—A progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of function
and death of nerve cells in several areas of the
brain, leading to loss of mental functions such as
memory and learning.
Computed axial tomography (CT)—Computed
axial tomography (CT) is a x-ray technique that
has the ability to image soft tissue, bone, and
blood vessels.
Cortex—The thin convoluted surface of the brain
comprised primarilyof cell bodies of neurons.
MRI—Magnetic resonance imaging is an imaging
technique that uses radiowaves, magnetic fields,

Stereotactic brain needle biopsy—In this procedure a computer uses information from a CT or MRI
to create a three-dimensional map of the operation
site to better guide the needle to perform the biopsy.

Precautions
Imaging of the brain is performed to determine
the precise positioning of the needle to enter the brain.

Description
When an abnormality of the brain is suspected,
Stereotactic (probing in three dimensions) brain needle biopsy is performed and guided precisely by a
computer system to avoid serious complications. A
small hole is drilled into the skull, and a needle is
inserted into the brain tissue guided by computerassisted imaging techniques (CT or MRI scans).
Historically, the patient’s head was held in a rigid
frame to direct the probe into the brain; however
since the early nineties, it has been possible to perform
these biopsies without the frame. Since the frame was
attached to the skull with screws, this advancement is
less invasive and better tolerated by the patient. The
doctor (pathologist) prepares the sample for analysis
and studies it further under a microscope.

Preparation
A CT or MRI brain scan is done to find the
position where the biopsy will be performed. Prior to
the biopsy, the patient is placed under general
anesthesia.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The patient is monitored in the recovery room for
several hours and is usually required to spend a few
days in the hospital since general anesthesia is required.

Risks
The procedure is invasive and includes risks
associated with anesthesia and surgery. Brain injury
may occur due to removal of brain tissue. The resulting scar, left on the brain has the potential to trigger
seizures.

Normal results
After examining the brain tissue directly, no
abnormalities are detected.

Abnormal results
Various brain abnormalities can be diagnosed
by microscopic analysis of the tissue sample. The
pathologist (a physician trained in how disease affects
the body’s tissues) looks for abnormal growth,
changes in cell membranes, and/or abnormal collections of cells. In Alzheimer’s disease, the cortex of the
brain contains abnormal collections of plaques. If
infection is suspected, the infectious organism can be
cultured from the tissue and identified. Classification
of tumors is also possible after biopsy.

I Brain tumor
Definition
A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue in
the brain. Unlike other tumors, brain tumors spread
by local extension and rarely metastasize (spread)
outside the brain. A benign brain tumor is composed
of non-cancerous cells and does not metastasize
beyond the part of the brain where it originates. A
brain tumor is considered malignant if it contains
cancer cells, or if it is composed of harmless cells
located in an area where it suppresses one or more
vital functions.

Description
Each year, more than 17,000 brain tumors are
diagnosed in the United States. About half of all primary brain tumors are benign, but in life-threatening
locations. The rest are malignant and invasive.
Benign brain tumors

A scan of a brain with a tumor located in the central right
portion of the brain. (Illustration by Argosy Inc.)

Benign brain tumors, composed of harmless cells,
have clearly defined borders, can usually be completely removed, and are unlikely to recur. Benign brain
tumors do not infiltrate nearby tissues but can cause
severe pain, permanent brain damage, and death.
Benign brain tumors sometimes become malignant.

KEY TERMS
Central nervous system (CNS)—The division of the
nervous system that consists of the brain and spinal
cord.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)—Clear liquid that fills
brain cavities and protects the brain and spinal
cord.

Malignant brain tumors
Malignant brain tumors do not have distinct borders. They tend to grow rapidly, increasing pressure
within the brain (IICP) and can spread in the brain or
spinal cord beyond the point where they originate. It is
highly unusual for malignant brain tumors to spread
beyond the central nervous system (CNS).

Gamma knife—High-dose radiation treatment for
intracranial tumors.
Intracranial—Located within or on the surface of
the brain.

Primary brain tumors
Primary brain tumors originate in the brain. They
represent about 1% of all cancers and 2.5% of all
cancer deaths.
Metastatic or secondary brain tumors
Approximately 25% of all cancer patients develop
secondary or metastatic brain tumors when cancer
cells spread from another part of the body to the
brain. Secondary brain tumors are most apt to occur
in patients who have:


breast cancer.



colon cancer.

634



kidney cancer.



lung cancer.



melanoma (cancer) of the skin. These metastatic
brain tumors can develop on any part of the brain
or spinal cord.



cancer within the nasal passages and/or throat that
follow the nerve pathways into the skull, and metastasize to the brain.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Brain tumors can develop at any age, but are
most common in children between the ages of 3-12,
and in adults aged 55-65. Primary brain cancer is the
second most common cause of cancer death between
birth and the age of 34, and the fourth most common
cause of cancer death in men aged 35-54. Primary
tumors of the brain and central nervous system are
often associated with HIV infection. Men and caucasians have a higher risk of developing brain
tumors. Other risk factors being studied include children with a history of previous radiation treatment
to the head for cancer; parents with certain cancers
(nervous system, salivary gland, colon); having an
older father; having well-educated parents; occupational exposure to vinyl chloride, lead, and pesticides; history of epilepsy; history of certain genetic
conditions (tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, von
Hippel Lindau, familial polyposis, Osler-WeberRendu, Li-Fraumeni).
Naming and grading brain tumors
The name of a brain tumor describes where it
originates, how it grows, and what kind of cells it
contains. A tumor in an adult is also graded or staged
according to:


how malignant it is



how rapidly it is growing and how likely it is to
invade other tissues



how closely its cells resemble normal cells. (The more
abnormal a tumor cell looks, the faster it is likely to
grow)

Low-grade brain tumors usually have welldefined borders. Some low-grade brain tumors form
or are enclosed (encapsulated) in cysts. Low-grade
brain tumors grow slowly, if at all. They may spread
throughout the brain, but rarely metastasize to other
parts of the body.
Mid-grade and high-grade tumors grow more
rapidly than low-grade tumors. Described as ‘‘truly
malignant,’’ these tumors usually infiltrate healthy
tissue. The growth pattern makes it difficult to remove
the entire tumor, and these tumors recur more often
than low-grade tumors.
A single brain tumor can contain several different
types of cells. The tumor’s grade is determined by the
highest-grade (most malignant) cell detected under a
microscope, even if most of the cells in the tumor are
less malignant. An infiltrating tumor is a tumor of any
grade that grows into surrounding tissue.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Types of brain tumors
Glioma is the term used to refer to the most prevalent primary brain tumors. Gliomas arise from glial
tissue, which supports and nourishes cells that send
messages from the brain to other parts of the body.
These tumors may be either malignant or benign.
Astrocytomas, ependymomas, and mixed gliomas are
three of the most common gliomas.
ASTROCYTOMAS. Named for the star-like shape of
their cells, astrocytomas can develop on any part of
the brain or spinal cord. Non-infiltrating astrocytomas grow slowly, and rarely spread to nearby tissue.
Mild-to-moderately anaplastic astrocytomas with
well-differentiated borders do not grow as slowly as
non-infiltrating astrocytomas, and they do spread to
surrounding tissues.

Anaplastic astrocytomas, which are also called
Grade III astrocytomas, look more abnormal and
grow more rapidly than non-infiltrating or mild-tomoderately anaplastic tumors.
Grade IV astrocytomas are also called glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors. Accounting for 30%
of all primary brain tumors, GBMs are the most common brain tumors in middle-aged adults. GBMs are
the most malignant of all brain tumors. Because they
contain a greater mixture of cells than any other brain
tumor, they are the most difficult to treat.
EPENDYMOMAS. Also called ependymal tumors,
ependymomas account for 9% of all gliomas, and
5% of all intracranial tumors. These tumors, which
are most common in children and adolescents, begin in
the very thin membranes that help form cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) and line the brain cavities (ventricles) that
contain it.

Ependymomas are usually benign, have welldifferentiated borders, resemble normal cells, and
grow very slowly. The cells of anaplastic (malignant)
ependymomas look abnormal and grow more rapidly
than the cells of benign tumors.
MIXED GLIOMAS. These heterogeneous tumors contain elements of astrocytomas and ependymomas and/
or oligodendrogliomas. These are rare tumors that
usually occur in middle-aged adults, grow slowly, and
do not usually spread beyond the part of the brain where
they originate. Mixed gliomas behave like tumors composed of the highest-grade cells they contain.

Non-glial brain tumors
The most common brain tumors that do not
develop from glial cells are medulloblastomas, meningiomas, and Schwannomas.
635

Brain tumor

Who gets brain tumors

Brain tumor

MEDULLOBLASTOMAS. Scientists once thought
medulloblastomas (MDLs) developed from glial
cells. These fast-growing, malignant tumors are now
believed to originate in developing cells not normally
present in the body after birth. They are sometimes
called primitive neurodectal tumors (PNET).

chemicals have a greater-than-average risk of developing them. There is no evidence that head injury causes
brain tumors, but researchers are trying to determine
the relationship, if any, between brain tumors and
viruses, family history, and long-term exposure to
electromagnetic fields.

MDL tumors are most common in children and
are more common in boys than in girls. Only 30% of
MDL tumors occur in adults. MDL tumors usually
originate in the cerebellum (the part of the brain that
controls coordination and some muscle activity), and
are often carried to other parts of the brain by cerebrospinal fluid. MDL tumors rarely metastasize
beyond the brain and spinal cord.

Symptoms do not usually appear until the tumor
grows large enough to displace, damage, or destroy
delicate brain tissue. When that happens, the patient
may experience:

MENINGIOMAS. Meningiomas, which represent
more than 20% of all primary brain tumors, originate in
the membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord
(meninges). These tumors are usually benign and most
often occur in women aged 30-50 years old. Meningiomas
grow so slowly that the brain can sometimes become
accustomed to their presence. Meningiomas compress,
rather than invade, brain tissue and may grow to be
quite large before any symptoms appear.
SCHWANNOMAS. Schwannomas originate in the
Schwann cells. These cells produce myelin, material
that protects the acoustic nerve, which controls hearing. These benign tumors are twice as common in
women as in men, and are most often diagnosed in
patients between the ages 30-60.

Schwannomas grow very slowly, and many people
adapt to the slight hearing loss and balance problems
that are the tumors’ earliest symptoms. A pear-shaped
Schwannoma can cause sudden or gradual loss of hearing in an ear. As the tumor progresses, it can press on
the nerves that control movement and feeling in the
face, and cause headaches and facial numbness or
tingling. The patient may have trouble walking, swallowing, or controlling eye movements, and the sense of
taste can be affected. A Schwannoma that grows large
enough to press on the brainstem can be deadly.
tumors
that occur in children are described as supratentorial
(in the upper part of the brain) or infratentorial (in
the lowest part of the brain). Astrocytomas and ependymomas are common supratentorial tumors.
Infratentorial tumors include medulloblastomas,
astrocytomas, and ependymomas.

Surgery
Surgery is the treatment of choice for accessible

activity in the brain



allowing neurosurgeons to see exactly how the tumor

Treatment
Brain tumors are treated by multidisciplinary
teams of highly skilled specialists whose decisions are
based on:


results of diagnostic tests



tumor size, position, and growth pattern



classic operation



laser microsurgery (uses high temperatures to vaporize tumor cells



ultrasonic aspiration (uses ultrasound waves to
break up the tumor into smaller bits which can be

Before undergoing brain surgery, patients are
often given:


steroids to reduce swelling of brain tissue



anticonvulsant medications to prevent or control
seizures



radiation treatments to reduce tumor size

Patients whose benign brain tumors can be completely removed may not require any additional treatment, but periodic physical and neurologic
examinations and CT or MRI scans are sometimes
recommended to determine whether the tumor has
returned. Because surgeons cannot be sure that every
bit of an infiltrating or metastasizing tumor has been
removed, radiation and chemotherapy are used to
eradicate cells that may have escaped the scalpel.
If a tumor cannot be completely removed, removing a portion of it (debulking) can alleviate the
patient’s symptoms, enhance the sense of well-being,
and increase the effectiveness of other treatments.

Radiation therapy
External radiotherapy, generally delivered on an
outpatient basis, directs radiation to the tumor and the
area around it. Implant radiation therapy involves
placing tiny pieces of radioactive material in the
brain. Left in place permanently, or for a short time,
these radioactive pellets release measured doses of
radiation each day. This technique is called brachytherapy. Patients are usually hospitalized during
the several days the pellets are most active.
Stereoactic radiosurgery involves fitting the
patient with a frame to stabilize the head, using imaging
techniques to determine the exact location of tumor
cells, and using a sophisticated instrument to administer radiation precisely to that point. Instruments used
for delivery of radiation include the gamma knife,
adapted linear accelerator (LINAC), and cyclotron.
A variety of drugs may also be given during radiation therapy, to protect brain cells from the effects of
radiation (radioprotective drugs), to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to radiation (radiosensitizers), or
to boost radiation’s effects (radioenhancers).
Chemotherapy
One or more cancer-killing drugs may be taken by
mouth or injected into a blood vessel, muscle, or the
cerebrospinal fluid. Chemotherapy may be used with
radiation and surgery as part of a patient’s initial
treatment, or used alone to treat tumors that recur in
the same place or in another part of the body. The
usual chemotherapy regimen for a brain tumor is a
combination approach, most commonly using procarbazine, CCNU, and vincristine.

When a young child has a brain tumor, chemotherapy is often used to eliminate or delay the
need for radiation.
Other treatments
If a brain tumor cannot be cured, treatment is
designed to make the patient as comfortable as possible and preserve as much of his neurologic functioning
as possible. The patient’s doctor may prescribe:


analgesics to relieve pain



anticancer drugs to limit tumor growth



anticonvulsants to control seizures



steroids to reduce swelling of brain tissue
Potential therapies

Scientists are studying ways to empower chemotherapy drugs to penetrate the blood-brain barrier
(which protects the CNS by separating the brain
from blood circulating throughout the body), and
attack cancer cells that have infiltrated tissue
inside it. Agents under investigation include both
mannitol and substances called receptor-mediated
permeabilizers
Brain tumor researchers are also investigating:


Less invasive surgical procedures.



Monoclonal antibodies, which pair antibodies with
radioactive substances. The antibodies are directed
to find and attach to tumor cells, at which time the
radioactive substance kills the tumor cell.



Interleukin and interferon, which are substances produced naturally by the human immune system which
seem to kill tumor cells. Scientists seek to produce
these substances in the laboratory and incorporate
their use in brain tumor treatment.



T-lymphocytes, which are also produced normally
by the human immune system, and are being used
to inject directly into the tumor location during surgery and to infuse into the bloodstream after surgery,
in the hopes that they will boost the immune system’s
ability to fight tumor cells.



Tumor vaccines, which use elements of tumor cells to
stimulate the patient’s immune system.



Methods of incorporating chemotherapy drugs into
tumor cells to reduce the need for radiation.



Laboratory techniques that enable physicians to
select the chemotherapy drugs most likely to kill
particular types of tumors.

New methods of delivering chemotherapy are
being used as well. These include:


interstitial chemotherapy is performed at the time of
surgery. A chemotherapy-soaked wafer is placed in
the cavity left after tumor removal.



Intrathecal chemotherapy instills the medications
right into the spinal fluid.



Intraarterial chemotherapy uses tiny catheter tubes
to delivery high-dose chemotherapy directly into the
arteries of the brain.



Potentially toxic chemotherapy drugs can be
wrapped in special biologic envelopes called liposomes, to allow the drugs to be delivered to the
tumor without adversely affecting other healthy tissues along the way.



Electrochemotherapy uses electric voltage to transport chemotherapy agents into the brain.

Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments have not been shown to
cure brain tumors and should never be substituted
for conventional therapy. However, complementary
therapies (used with, not instead of, standard treatments) can help some patients cope with the stress of
their illness and side effects of their treatment.
Massage, meditation, and reflexology help some
patients relax; while yoga is said to soothe the body,
spirit, and mind. Hydrotherapy uses ice, liquid, and
steam to improve circulation and relieve pain.
Therapeutic touch practitioners say they can relieve
pain and other symptoms by moving their hands in
slow, rhythmic motions several inches above the
patient’s body.
Botanical therapies, homeopathic treatment, traditional Chinese medicine treatments, nutritional
focuses on diet and supplements, and detoxification
can also be incorporated as complementary therapies.

Prognosis
The patient’s prognosis depends on where the
tumor is located, what type of cells it contains, the
size of the tumor, and the effect its already had on
adjacent brain structures. A patient whose tumor is
discovered early and removed completely may make a
full recovery, but the surgery itself can harm or destroy
normal brain tissue and cause:


problems with thought, speech, and coordination



seizures



weakness



personality changes.

Hospices provide a supportive environment and help
patients manage pain and remain comfortable.
Consequences of radiation therapy
Cells killed by radiation can cluster in the brain,
resembling tumors. They can cause headaches, seizures, and memory loss. Children treated with radiation may lose some of their eyesight and develop
learning problems. Radiation damage to the pituitary
gland can hinder normal growth and development.
Consequences of chemotherapy
Some drugs used to treat brain tumors can cause
kidney damage and temporary or permanent tingling
in the fingers and ringing in the ears.
Inoperable tumors
Brain tumors that cannot be removed may cause
irreversible brain damage and death.

Prevention
The cause of primary brain tumors has not been
determined, so there is no known way to prevent
them.
The best way to prevent secondary or metastatic brain tumors is to eliminate such risk
factors as:


poor nutrition and a low-fiber diet; since these contribute to development of intestinal cancers



smoking, which causes lung cancer



excessive use of alcohol, which is associated with
liver cancer



excessive exposure to the sun, which can cause melanoma (a deadly form of skin cancer).

Monthly self-examinations of the breasts and testicles can detect breast and testicular cancer at their
earliest, most curable stages.

Although these post-operative problems may
initially be more severe than the symptoms produced
by the tumor, they will probably diminish or disappear
in time.

ORGANIZATIONS

Occupational therapy can teach patients and their
families new ways to approach daily tasks. Physical
therapy can benefit patients who have difficulty keeping their balance, expressing their thoughts, speaking,
or swallowing. Children may need special tutors before
and after returning to school. For patients who have
incurable brain tumors, hospice care may be available.

Specialized equipment is needed for different types of

biopsy is less invasive than surgical biopsy. It is appropriate for most, but not all situations. However, some
surgeons feel it is far less accurate.

Surgical biopsy

Breast-feeding see Lactation

I Breast biopsy
Definition
A breast biopsy is removal of breast tissue for
examination by a pathologist. This can be accomplished
surgically, or by withdrawing tissue through a needle.

Purpose
A biopsy is recommended when a significant
abnormality is found, either on physical examination
and/or by an imaging test. Examples of abnormality
can include a breast lump felt during physical self
examination or tissue changes noticed from a mammogram test. Before a biopsy is performed, it is important to make sure that the threat of cancer cannot be
disproved or ruled out by a simpler, less invasive
examination. A lump may be obviously harmless
when examined by ultrasound. If this is not decisive,
the presence of cancer or a variety of benign breast
conditions can be determined using a biopsy.

Precautions
The type of biopsy recommended should be considered. This will depend on whether the area can be
640

If an abnormality is not felt during a self examination, there are signs that indicate the need for medical attention. These include:


severe breast pain



changes in the size of a breast or the nipple



changes in the shape of both breast or nipple



pitting, dumpling or redness of the breast skin



nipple redness, irritation, or inversion



changes in the pattern of veins visible on the surface
of the breast



some types of nipple discharge

If the abnormality is not felt, a needle localization
must be done before the actual surgery. After local
anesthetic is administered, a fine wire is placed in the
area of concern. Either x ray or ultrasound guidance is
used. The patient is awake and usually sitting up.
There are two types of breast biopsy considered
here, excisional and incisional. An excisional biopsy is a
surgical procedure, where the entire area of concern
and some surrounding tissue is removed. It is usually
done as an outpatient procedure, in a hospital or free
standing surgery center. The patient may be awake, and
is sometimes given medication to make her drowsy.
The area to be operated on is numbed with local
anesthetic. Infrequently, general anesthesia is used.
An excisional biopsy itself usually takes under one
hour. The total amount of time spent at the facility

Excisional biopsy

A fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin needle to withdraw fluid and cells from the breast to be examined. An excisional

depends on the type of anesthesia used, whether a
needle localization was done, and the extent of the
surgery.
If a mass is very large, an incisional biopsy may be
performed. In this case only a portion of the area is
removed and sent for analysis. The procedure is the
same as an excisional biopsy in other respects.
Needle biopsy
A needle biopsy removes part of the suspicious
area for examination. There are two types, aspiration
biopsy (using a fine needle), and large core needle
biopsy. Either of these may be called a percutaneous
needle biopsy. Percutaneous refers to a procedure
done through the skin.
A fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin
needle to withdraw fluid and cells that can be studied.
It can be done in a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital.
Local anesthetic may be used, but is sometimes withheld, as it may be more painful than the biopsy needle.
The area to place the needle may be located by touch.
No specialized equipment is needed. However, using
ultrasound guidance enables the physician to feel and
see the lesion at the same time. The actual withdrawing
of fluid and cells can be visualized as it occurs. This helps
ensure that the specimen is taken from the right place.
A large core needle biopsy uses a larger diameter
needle to remove small pieces of tissue, about the size
of a grain of rice. It can be done in a clinic or hospital
that has the appropriate facilities. Local anesthetic is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

routinely used. Ultrasound or x ray is used for guidance of a large core needle biopsy.
If the suspicious area is seen best with x ray, a
stereotactic device is used. This means that x rays are
taken from several angles. This information is fed into
a computer, which analyzes the data and guides the
needle to the correct place. The patient may be sitting
up, or she may be lying on her stomach, with her breast
positioned through an opening in the table. The breast
is held firmly, but comfortably between a plastic paddle and a metal plate, similar to those used for mammograms (a set of x rays taken of the front and side of
the breast). X rays may be taken before, during, and
after the tissue is drawn into the needle, to confirm
that the correct spot is biopsied. This procedure may
also be referred to as a stereotactic core biopsy, or a
mammotomy.
Ultrasound is used to guide needle placement for
some lesions. The patient lies on her back or side. After
the area is numbed, sterile gel is applied. The physician
places a transducer, an instrument about the size of an
electric shaver, over the skin. This produces an image
from the reflection of sound waves. A special needle,
usually in a spring loaded device, is used to obtain the
tissue. The procedure is observed on a monitor as it is
happening.

Preparation
A surgical breast biopsy may require the patient to
have nothing to eat or drink for a period of time before
641

Breast cancer

the operation. This will typically be from midnight the
night before, if general anesthesia is planned. No food
restrictions are necessary for needle biopsy. It is advisable to eat lightly before the procedure. This is especially important if the patient will be lying on her
stomach for a stereotactic biopsy.

Aftercare
After a surgical biopsy, the incision will be closed
with stitches, and covered with a bandage. The bandage
can usually be removed in one or two days. Stitches
are taken out approximately one week afterward.
Depending on the extent of the operation, normal activities can be resumed in approximately one to three days.
Vigorous exercise may be limited for one to three weeks.
The skin opening for a needle biopsy is minimal.
It may be closed with thin, clear tape, called a steri strip,
or covered with a bandaid and a small gauze bandage.
The patient can return to her usual routine immediately
after the biopsy. Strenuous activity or heavy lifting is
not recommended for 24 hours. Any bandages can be
removed one or two days after the biopsy.

Abnormal results
An abnormal pathology report indicates a cancer
is present. If a fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed, the pathologist has viewed individual cells
under a microscope to see if they appear cancerous.
Large core needle biopsy and surgical biopsy will be
able to give more information. This includes the type
of cancer, whether it has invaded surrounding tissue,
and how likely it is to spread quickly. There are some
conditions which are not malignant but indicate high
risk for future development of breast cancer. If these
are identified, more frequent monitoring of the area
may be recommended.

Risks
Infection is always a possibility when the skin is
broken, although this rarely occurs. Redness, swelling,
or severe pain at the biopsy site would indicate a
possible infection. Another possible consequence of a
breast biopsy is a hematoma. This is a collection of
blood at the biopsy site. It is usually absorbed naturally by the body. If it is very large and uncomfortable,
it may need to be drained. A surgical breast biopsy
may produce a visible scar on the breast. Sometimes
this may make future mammograms harder to interpret accurately.
A false negative pathology report is another risk.
This means that no cancer was found when a cancer
was present. The incidence of this varies with the
biopsy technique. In general, fine needle aspiration
biopsies have the highest rate of false negative results,
but there may be variation in results between facilities.

Normal results
A normal pathology report indicates no malignancy is present. The tissue sample may be further
classified as a benign breast condition, such as tumor
of the breast (fibroadenoma) or connective tissue that
resembles fiber (fibrosis). Studies have demonstrated
that approximately 80% of all breast biopsies result in
a benign pathology report.
642

I Breast cancer
Definition
Breast cancer is caused by the development of
malignant cells in the breast. The malignant cells
originate in the lining of the milk glands or ducts of
the breast (ductal epithelium), defining this malignancy as a cancer. Cancer cells are characterized by
uncontrolled division leading to abnormal growth
and the ability of these cells to invade normal tissue
locally or to spread throughout the body, in a process
called metastasis.

Description
Breast cancer arises in the milk-producing
glands of the breast tissue. Groups of glands in
normal breast tissue are called lobules. The products
of these glands are secreted into a ductal system that
leads to the nipple. Depending on where in the
glandular or ductal unit of the breast the cancer
arises, it will develop certain characteristics that
are used to sub-classify breast cancer into types.
The pathologist will denote the subtype at the time of
evaluation with the microscope. Ductal carcinoma

begins in the ducts, lobular carcinoma has a pattern
involving the lobules or glands. The more important
classification is related to the evaluated tumor’s capability to invade, as this characteristic defines the
disease as a true cancer. The stage before invasive
cancer is called in situ, meaning that the early malignancy has not yet become capable of invasion. Thus,
ductal carcinoma in situ is considered a minimal
breast cancer.

How breast cancer spreads
The primary tumor begins in the breast itself but
once it becomes invasive, it may progress beyond the
breast to the regional lymph nodes or travel (metastasize) to other organ systems in the body and become
systemic in nature. Lymph is the clear, protein-rich
fluid that bathes the cells throughout the body.
Lymph will work its way back to the bloodstream via
small channels known as lymphatics. Along the way,
the lymph is filtered through cellular stations known
as nodes, thus they are called lymph nodes. Nearly all
organs in the body have a primary lymph node group
filtering fluid that comes from that organ. In the
breast, the primary lymph nodes are under the armpit,
or axilla. Classically, the primary tumor begins in the
breast and the first place to which it is likely to spread
is the regional lymph nodes. Cancer, as it invades in
its place of origin, may also work its way into blood
vessels. If cancer gets into the blood vessels, the blood
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

vessels provide yet another route for the cancer to
spread to other organs of the body.
Breast cancer follows this classic progression
though it often becomes systemic or widespread early
in the course of the disease. By the time one can feel a
lump in the breast it is often 0.4 inches, or one centimeter, in size and contains roughly a million cells. It is
estimated that a tumor of this size may take one to five
years to develop. During that time, the cancer may
metastasize, or spread by lymphatics or blood to areas
elsewhere in the body.
When primary breast cancer spreads, it may first
go to the axillary nodes. If this occurs, regional metastasis exists. If it proceeds elsewhere either by lymphatic
or blood-borne spread, the patient develops systemic
metastasis that may involve a number of other organs
in the body. Favorite sites of systemic involvement for
breast cancer are the lung, bones, liver, and the skin

and soft tissue. As it turns out, the presence of, and the
actual number of, regional lymph nodes containing
cancer remains the single best indicator of whether or
not the cancer has become widely metastatic. Because
tests to discover metastasis in other organs may not be
sensitive enough to reveal minute deposits, the evaluation of the axilla for regional metastasis becomes very
important in making treatment decisions for this
disease.
If breast cancer spreads to other major organs of
the body, its presence will compromise the function of
those organs. Death is the result of extreme compromise of vital organ function.

Benign—Not malignant, noncancerous.
Biopsy—A procedure in which suspicious tissue
is removed and examined by a pathologist for cancer
or other disease. For breast biopsies, the tissue may
be obtained by open surgery, or through a needle.
Estrogen-receptor assay—A test to see if a breast
cancer needs estrogen to grow.
Hormones—Chemicals produced by glands in the
body that circulate in the blood and control the
actions of cells and organs. Estrogens are hormones
that affect breast cancer growth.
Hormone therapy—Treating cancers by changing
the hormone balance of the body, instead of by
using cell-killing drugs.
Lumpectomy—A surgical procedure in which only
the cancerous tumor in the breast is removed,
together with a rim of normal tissue.
Lymph nodes—Small, bean-shaped masses of tissue scattered along the lymphatic system that act as
filters and immune monitors, removing fluids, bacteria, or cancer cells that travel through the lymph
system. Breast cancer cells in the lymph nodes
under the arm or in the chest are a sign that the
cancer has spread, and that it might recur.
Malignant—Cancerous.
Mammography—X-ray imaging of the breast that
can often detect lesions in the tissue too small or too
deep to be felt.
Oncogene—A gene that has to do with regulation of
cancer growth. An abnormality can produce cancer.

Demographics
Every woman is at risk for breast cancer. If she
lives to be 85, there is a one out of nine chance that she
will develop the condition sometime during her life. As
a woman ages, her risk of developing breast cancer
rises dramatically regardless of her family history. The
644

breast cancer risk of a 25-year-old woman is only one
out of 19,608; by age 45, it is one in 93. In fact, less
than 5% of cases are discovered before age 35 and
the majority of all breast cancers are found in women
over age 50.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Causes and symptoms
There are a number of risk factors for the development of breast cancer, including:


family history of breast cancer in mother or sister



early onset of menstruation and late menopause



reproductive history: women who had no children or
have children after age 30 and women who have
never breastfed have increased risk



history of abnormal breast biopsies

Though these are recognized risk factors, it is
important to note that more than 70% of women
who get breast cancer have no known risk factors.
Having several risk factors may boost a woman’s
chances of developing breast cancer, but the interplay
of predisposing factors is complex. In addition to
those accepted factors listed above, some studies suggest that high-fat diets, obesity, or the use of alcohol
may contribute to the risk profile. Another factor that
contributes to a woman’s risk profile is hormone
replacement therapy (HRT).
HRT provides significant relief of menopausal
symptoms, prevention of osteoporosis, and possibly
protection from cardiovascular disease and stroke.
While physicians have long known a small increased
risk for breast cancer was linked to use of HRT, a
landmark study released in 2003 proved the risk was
greater than thought. The Women’s Health Initiative
found that even relatively short-term use of estrogen
plus progestin is associated with increased risk of
breast cancer, diagnosis at a more advanced stage of
the disease, and a higher number of abnormal mammograms. The longer a woman used HRT, the more
her risk increased.
Of all the risk factors listed above, family history
is the most important. In The Biological Basis of
Cancer, the authors estimate that about half of all
familial breast cancer cases (families in which there is
a high breast cancer frequency) have mutations affecting the genes BRCA-1 or BRCA-2. In 2003, scientists
discovered a third gene called EMSY. However, breast
cancer due to heredity is only a small proportion of
breast cancer cases; only 5%–10% of all breast cancer
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

cases will be women who inherited a susceptibility
through their genes. Nevertheless, when the family
history is strong for development of breast cancer, a
woman’s risk is increased.
Not all lumps detected in the breast are cancerous.
Fibrocystic changes in the breast are extremely common. Also known as fibrocystic condition of the breast,
fibrocystic changes are a leading cause of noncancerous lumps in the breast. Fibrocystic changes
also cause symptoms of pain, swelling, or discharge
and may become evident to the patient or physician as
a lump that is either solid or filled with fluid. Complete
diagnostic evaluation of any significant breast
abnormality is mandatory because though women
commonly develop fibrocystic changes, breast cancer
is common also, and the signs and symptoms of fibrocystic changes overlap with those of breast cancer.
Certain benign changes in the breast may now be
linked to increased risk for breast cancer.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of breast cancer is accomplished
by the biopsy of any suspicious lump or mammographic abnormality that has been identified.
(A biopsy is the removal of tissue for examination
by a pathologist. A mammogram is a low-dose,
2-view, x-ray examination of the breast.) The patient
may be prompted to visit her doctor upon finding a
lump in a breast, or she may have noticed skin dimpling, nipple retraction, or discharge from the nipple.
A patient may not have noticed a symptom or
abnormality, and a lump was detected by a screening
mammogram.
When a patient has no signs or symptoms
Screening involves the evaluation of women who
have no symptoms or signs of a breast problem.
Mammography has been helpful in detecting breast
cancer that cannot be identified on physical examination. However, 10%–13% of breast cancer does not
show up on mammography, and a similar number of
patients with breast cancer have an abnormal mammogram and a normal physical examination. These
figures emphasize the need for examination as part of
the screening process.
Screening
It is recommended that women get into the habit of
doing monthly breast self examinations to detect any
lump at an early stage. If an uncertainty or a lump is
found, evaluation by an experienced physician and a
645

Breast cancer

In 2002, 200,000 new cases of breast cancer were
diagnosed. About 45,000 women die of breast cancer
each year, accounting for 16% of deaths caused by
cancer in women. However, deaths from breast cancer
are declining in recent years, a reflection of earlier
diagnosis from screening mammograms and improving therapies.

Breast cancer

mammogram is recommended. The American Cancer
Society (ACS) has made recommendations for the use
of mammography on a screening basis. In 2003, the
ACS updated its guidelines concerning screening mammograms. The most notable change was that women
should begin annual screening at age 40 instead of age
50. (in the past, the ACS, recommended beginning
mammograms at age 40, but only ever one or two
years instead of annually.) Women at higher risk for
breast cancer should benefit from beginning screenings
at earlier ages and at more frequent intervals.
Because of the greater awareness of breast cancer
in recent years, screening evaluations by examinations
and mammography are performed much more frequently than in the past. The result is that the number
of breast cancers diagnosed increased, but the disease is
being diagnosed at an earlier stage than previously. The
earlier the stage of disease at the time it is discovered,
the better the long-term outcome (prognosis) becomes.
When a patient has physical signs or symptoms
A common finding that leads to diagnosis is the
presence of a lump within the breast. Skin dimpling,
nipple retraction, or discharge from the nipple are less
frequent initial findings prompting biopsy. Though
bloody nipple discharge is distressing, it is most often
caused by benign disease. Skin dimpling or nipple
retraction in the presence of an underlying breast
mass on examination is a more advanced finding.
Actual skin involvement, with edema or ulceration of
the skin, are late findings.
The presence of a breast lump is a common sign of
breast cancer. If the lump is suspicious and the patient
has not had a mammogram by this point, a study
should be done on both breasts prior to anything else
so that the original characteristics of the lesion can be
studied. The opposite breast should also be evaluated
mammographically to determine if other problems
exist that were undetected by physical examination.
Whether an abnormal screening mammogram or
one of the signs mentioned above followed by a mammogram prompted suspicion, the diagnosis is established by obtaining tissue by biopsy of the area. There
are different types of biopsy, each utilized with its own
indication. If signs of widespread metastasis are
already present, biopsy of the metastasis itself may
establish diagnosis.
Biopsy
Depending on the situation, different types of biopsy
may be performed. The types include incisional and
excisional biopsies. In an incisional biopsy, the physician
646

takes a sample of tissue, and in excisional biopsy,
the mass is removed. Fine needle aspiration biopsy and
core needle biopsy are kinds of incisional biopsies.
FINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY. In a fine needle
aspiration biopsy, a fine-gauge needle may be passed
into the lesion and cells from the area suctioned into
the needle can be quickly prepared for microscopic
evaluation (cytology). (The patient experiencing nipple discharge also can have a sample taken of the
discharge for cytological evaluation.) Fine needle
aspiration is a simple procedure that can be done
under local anesthesia, and will tell if the lesion is a
fluid-filled cyst or whether it is solid. The sample
obtained will yield much diagnostic information.
Fine needle aspiration biopsy is an excellent technique
when the lump is palpable and the physician can easily
hit the target with the needle. If the lesion is a simple
cyst, the fluid will be evacuated and the mass will
disappear. If it is solid, the diagnosis may be obtained.
Care must be taken, however, because if the mass is
solid and the specimen is non-malignant, a complete
removal of the lesion may be appropriate to be sure.
CORE NEEDLE BIOPSY. Core needle biopsies also are
obtained simply under local anesthesia. The larger piece
of tissue obtained with its preserved architecture may
be helpful in confirming the diagnosis short of open
surgical removal. An open surgical incisional biopsy is
rarely needed for diagnosis because of the needle techniques. If there remains question as to diagnosis, a
complete open surgical biopsy may be required.
EXCISIONAL BIOPSY. When performed, the excisional (complete removal) biopsy is a minimal outpatient procedure often done under local anesthesia.
NON-PALPABLE LESIONS. As screening increases,
non-palpable lesions demonstrated only by mammography are becoming more common. The use of x rays
and computers to guide the needle for biopsy or to
place markers for the surgeon performing the excisional biopsy are commonly employed. Some benign
lesions can be fully removed by multiple directed core
biopsies. These techniques are very appealing because
they are minimally invasive; however, the physician
needs to be careful to obtain a good sample.

Other tests
If a lesion is not palpable and has simple cystic characteristics on mammography, ultrasound may be utilized both to determine that it is a cyst and to guide its
evacuation. Ultrasound may also be used in some cases to
guide fine needle or core biopsies of the breast.
Computed tomography (CT) scans have only rare
in the evaluation of breast lesions. Magnetic resonance

Treatment
Staging
Once diagnosis is established and before treatment
is rendered, more tests are done to determine if the
cancer has spread beyond the breast. These tests include
a chest x ray and blood count with liver function tests.
Along with the liver function measured by the blood
sample, the level of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme
from bone, is also determined. A radionuclear bone
scan may be ordered. This test looks at the places in
the body to which breast cancer usually metastasizes. A
CT scan also may be ordered. The physician will do a
careful examination of the axillae to assess likelihood of
regional metastasis. Sometimes, the physician removed
all of the axillary lymph nodes to assess breast cancer
stage. However, recent studies show great success with
sentinel lymph node biopsy. This technique removes the
sentinel lymph node, or that lymph node that receives
fluid drainage first from the area where the cancer is
located. If this node is free of cancer, staging can be
assigned accordingly. This method saves women the
discomfort and side effects associated with removing
additional lymph nodes in her armpit.
Using the results of these studies, clinical stage is
defined for the patient. This helps define treatment
protocol and prognosis. After surgical treatment, the
final, or pathologic, stage is defined as the true axillary
lymph node status is known. Detailed staging criteria
are available from the American Joint Commission
on Cancer Manual and are generalized here:


Stage 1—The cancer is no larger than 2 cm (0.8 in)
and no cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes.



Stage 2—The cancer is between 2 cm and 5 cm, and
the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.



Stage 3A—Tumor is larger than 5 cm (2 in) or is
smaller than 5 cm, but has spread to the lymph
nodes, which have grown into each other.



Stage 3B—Cancer has spread to tissues near the
breast, (local invasion), or to lymph nodes inside
the chest wall, along the breastbone.



Stage 4—Cancer has spread to skin and lymph nodes
beyond the axilla or to other organs of the body.
Treatment

Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy are all utilized in the treatment of breast cancer. Depending on
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

the stage, they will be used in different combinations
or sequences to effect an appropriate strategy for the
type and stage of the disease being treated.
SURGERY. Historically, surgical removal of the
entire breast and axillary contents along with the muscles down to the chest wall was performed as the lone
therapy, (radical mastectomy). In the last 25 years, as it
has been appreciated that breast cancer often spreads
early, surgery remains a primary option but other
therapies have risen in importance. Recent studies
have suggested that breast conserving treatment
improves the quality of life.

Today, surgical treatment is best thought of as a
combination of removal of the primary tumor and
staging of the axillary lymph nodes. A modified radical mastectomy involves removing the whole breast
along with the entire axillary contents but not the
muscles of the chest wall.
If the tumor is less than 1.5 (4 cm) in size and
located so that it can be removed without destroying
the reasonable cosmetic appearance of the residual
breast, just the primary tumor and a rim of normal
tissue will be removed. The axillary nodes will still be
removed for staging purposes, usually through a separate incision. Because of the risk of recurrence in the
remaining breast tissue, radiation therapy is used to
lessen the chance of local recurrence. This type of
primary therapy is known as lumpectomy, (or segmental mastectomy), and axillary dissection.
Sentinel lymph node biopsy, a technique for identifying which nodes in the axilla drain the tumor, has
been developed to provide selective sampling and
further lessen the degree of surgical trauma the patient
experiences.
When patients are selected appropriately based on
the preoperative clinical stage, all of these surgical
approaches have been shown to produce similar
results. In planning primary surgical therapy, it is
imperative that the operation is tailored to fit the
clinical circumstance of the patient.
The pathologic stage is determined after surgical
treatment absolutely defines the local parameters. In
addition to stage, there are other tests that are very
necessary to aid in decisions regarding treatment such
as adjuvant therapies. Adjuvant therapies are treatments utilized after the primary treatment to help
ensure that no microscopic disease exists and to help
prolong patients’ survival time.
RADIATION THERAPY. Like surgical therapy, radiation therapy is a local modality—it treats the tissue
exposed to radiation and not the rest of the body.

647

Breast cancer

imaging (MRI) has been used more often in recent
years to follow up on suspicious findings from mammograms or for certain patients.

Breast cancer

Radiation is usually given post-operatively after surgical
wounds have healed. The pathologic stage of the primary
tumor is now known and this aids in treatment planning.
The extent of the local surgery also influences the planning. Radiation may not be needed at all after modified
radical mastectomy for stage I disease, but is almost
always utilized when breast-preserving surgery is performed. If the tumor was extensive or if multiple nodes
were involved, the field of tissue exposed will vary
accordingly. Radiation is utilized as an adjunct to surgical therapy and is considered important to gaining local
control of the tumor. The use of radiation therapy does
not affect decisions for adjuvant treatment. In the past,
radiation was used as an alternative to surgery on occasion. However, now that breast-preserving surgical protocols have been developed, primary radiation treatment
of the tumor is no longer performed. Radiation also has
an important role in the treatment of the patient with
disseminated disease, particularly if it involves the skeleton. Radiation therapy can affect pain control and prevention of fracture in this circumstance.
DRUG THERAPY. Many breast cancers, particularly
those originating in post-menopausal women, are
responsive to hormones. These cancers have receptors
on their cells for estrogen and progesterone. Part of
primary tumor assessment after removal of the tumor
is the evaluation for the presence of these estrogen and
progesterone receptors. If they are present on the cancer cells, altering the hormone status of the patient will
inhibit tumor growth and have a positive impact on
survival. The drug tamoxifen binds up these receptors
on the cancer cells so that the hormones can’t have an
effect and, in so doing, inhibits tumor growth. If the
patient has these receptors present, tamoxifen is commonly prescribed for five years as an adjunct to primary
treatment. Adjuvant hormonal therapy with tamoxifen
has few side effects but they have to be kept in mind,
particularly the need for yearly evaluation of the uterus.
Other agents directed at altering hormone environment
are under study. Because of these agents, there is rarely
any need for surgical removal of hormone-producing
glands, such as the ovary or adrenal, that was sometimes necessary in the past.

In late 2003, cancer experts were beginning to
recommend a new group of drugs called aromatase
inhibitors (Arimidex, common name anastrozole, or
more recently Femara and Novartis, common name
letrozole). New guidelines also recommend letrozole
following five years of tamoxifen therapy. These drugs
fight breast cancer differently, but early research shows
they fight it as effectively and with fewer side effects.
Shortly after the modified radical mastectomy
replaced the radical mastectomy as primary surgical
648

treatment, survival after local treatment in stage II
breast cancer was improved by the addition of chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy for an interval
of four to six months is now standard treatment
for patients with stage II disease. The addition of
systemic therapy to local treatment in patients who
have no evidence of disease is performed on the basis
that some patients have metastases that are not currently demonstrable because they are microscopic. By
treating the whole patient early, before widespread
disease is diagnosed, the adjuvant treatment improves
survival rates from roughly 60% for stage II to about
75% at five years after treatment. The standard regimen of cytoxan, methotrexate, and 5-flourouracil,
(CMF), is given for six months and is well tolerated.
The regimen of cytoxan, adriamycin (doxorubicin),
and 5-floururacil, (CAF), is a bit more toxic but only
requires four months. (Adriamycin and cytoxin may
also be used alone, without the fluorouracil.) The two
methods are about equivalent in results. Adjuvant
hormonal therapy may be added to the adjuvant chemotherapy as they work through different routes.
The encouraging results from adjuvant therapy in
stage II disease have led to the study of similar therapy
in stage I disease. The results are not as dramatic, but
they are real. Currently, stage I disease is divided into
categories a, b, and c on the basis of tumor size. Stage
Ia is less than a centimeter in diameter. Adjuvant
hormonal or chemotherapy is now commonly recommended for stage Ib and Ic patients. The toxicity of the
treatment must be weighed individually for the patient
as patients with stage I disease have a survivorship of
over 80% without adjuvant chemotherapy.
If patients are diagnosed with stage IV disease or,
in spite of treatment, progress to a state of widespread
disease, systemic chemotherapy is utilized in a more
aggressive fashion. In addition to the adriamycin-containing regimens, the taxols (docetaxel and paclitaxel)
have been found to be effective in inducing remission.
On the basis of prognostic factors such as total
number of involved nodes over 10, aneuploid DNA
with a high synthesis value, or aggressive findings on
microscopic evaluation, some patients with stage II or
III disease can be predicted to do poorly. If their
performance status allows, they can be considered for
treatment with highly aggressive chemotherapy. The
toxicity is such that bone marrow failure will result. To
get around this anticipated side effect of the aggressive
therapy, either the patients will be transplanted with
their own stem cells, (the cells that will give rise to new
marrow), or a traditional bone marrow transplantation
will be required. This therapy can be a high-risk procedure for patients. It is given with known risk to patients
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

another drug, raloxifene, is as effective as tamoxifen in
reducing breast cancer risk in high-risk patients. That
study was begun in 1999, and participants were to be
monitored for five years.

For patients who are diagnosed with advanced
local disease, surgery may be preceded with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The disease locally regresses
allowing traditional surgical treatment to those who
could not receive it otherwise. Chemotherapy and
sometimes radiation therapy will continue after the
surgery. The regimens of this type are referred to as
neo-adjuvant therapy. This has been proven to be effective in stage III disease. Neo-adjuvant therapy is now
being studied in patients with large tumors that are
stage II in an effort to be able to offer breast preservation to these patients.

And, while most breast cancer can’t be prevented,
it can be diagnosed from a mammogram at an early
stage when it is most treatable. The results of awareness
and routine screening have allowed earlier diagnosis,
which results in a better prognosis for those discovered.

A drug known as Herceptin (trastuzumab), a
monoclonal antibody, is now being used in the treatment of those with systemic disease. The product
of the Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 gene,
(HER-2) is overexpressed in 25%–30% of breast cancers. Herceptin binds to the HER-2 receptors on the
cancer, resulting in the arrest of growth of these cells.

Prognosis
The prognosis for breast cancer depends on the
type and stage of cancer. Over 80% of stage I patients
are cured by current therapies. Stage II patients survive overall about 70% of the time, those with more
extensive lymph nodal involvement doing worse than
those with disease confined to the breast. About 40%
of stage III patients survive five years, and about 20%
of stage IV patients do so. In 2003, research showed
that young women who choose breast-conserving surgery are at higher risk for local recurrence and should
receive indefinite follow-up care from their physicians.

Prevention
The use of tamoxifen and other agents which alter
the hormone status of the patient are under study. The
National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project
(NSABP) with support from the National Cancer
Institute began a study in 1992 (called the Breast
Cancer Prevention Trial, or BCPT) studying the use
of tamoxifen as a breast cancer preventative for highrisk women. The results yielded from the study showed
that tamoxifen significantly reduced breast cancer
risk, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approved the use of tamoxifen to reduce breast cancer
risk for high-risk patients in 1998. Another NSABP
study, known as STAR, is seeking to understand if

Breast enlargement see Breast implants

I Breast implants
Definition
Breast implantation is a surgical procedure for
enlarging the breast. Breast-shaped sacks made of a
silicone outer shell and filled with silicone gel or saline
(salt water), called implants, are used.

Purpose
Breast implantation is usually performed to
make normal breasts larger for cosmetic purposes.
Sometimes a woman having a breast reconstruction
after a mastectomy will need the opposite breast
enlarged to make the breasts more symmetric.
Breasts that are very unequal in size due to trauma
or congenital deformity may also be corrected with an
enlargement procedure.

Precautions
A woman in poor health or with a severe chronic
disease is not a good candidate for this procedure.

Description
A cosmetic breast enlargement is usually an outpatient procedure. It may be done under local or

Stock Market. Reproduced by permission.)

general anesthesia, depending on patient and physician
preference. The incision is made through the armpit,
under the breast, or around the areola (the darkened
area around the nipple). These techniques create the
most inconspicuous scars. The implant is placed
between the breast tissue and underlying chest muscle,
or under the chest muscle. The operation takes approximately one to two hours. The cost of a cosmetic procedure is rarely covered by insurance. However, if
enlargement is part of breast reconstruction after a
mastectomy, health plans may pay for some or all of
it. The surgeon’s fee ranges from $2,700-$4,200 and up.
The procedure may also be called breast augmentation
or augmentation mammaplasty.

Preparation
Before the surgery is performed, the woman
should have a clear understanding of what her new
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Breast infection see Mastitis

Breast reconstruction

breasts will look like. She and her physician should
agree about the desired final result. Many surgeons
find it helpful to have the patient review before and
after pictures, to clarify expectations.

Breast radiography see Mammography

Aftercare
Driving and normal activities may be restricted for
up to one week. Stitches are usually removed in seven to
10 days. Typically, a woman can resume all routines,
including vigorous exercise, in about three weeks. The
scars will be red for approximately one month, but will
fade to their final appearance within one or two years.

Risks
Risks which are common to any surgical procedure include bleeding, infection, anesthesia reaction,
or unexpected scarring. A breast enlargement may
also result in decreased sensation in the breast, or
interference with breast-feeding. Implants can also
make it more difficult to read and interpret mammograms, possibly delaying breast cancer detection. Also,
the implant itself can rupture and leak, or become
displaced. A thick scar that normally forms around
the implant, called a capsule, can become very hard.
This is called capsular contracture, and may result in
pain and/or an altered appearance of the breast. The
older the implant, the greater the chances that these
problems will occur.
There has been intermittent publicity about possible health risks from breast implants. Most concerns
have focused on silicone gel-filled implants. As of
1992, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
restricted the use of this type of implant, and ordered
further studies. Today only saline-filled implants are
used for cosmetic breast surgery. Recent studies have
shown no evidence long-term health risks from silicone implants. However, research on the possible links
between these implants and autoimmune or connective tissue diseases is continuing.

I Breast reconstruction
Definition
Breast reconstruction is a series of surgical procedures performed to recreate a breast. Reconstructions
are commonly done after one or both breasts are
removed as a treatment for breast cancer. Also, a
breast may need to be refashioned for other reasons,
such as trauma or abnormalities that occur during
breast development.

Purpose
Many authorities consider reconstruction an
integral part of the therapy for breast cancer. A
breast that appears natural offers a sense of wholeness and normalcy, which can aid in the psychological recovery from breast cancer. It eliminates the need
for an external prosthesis (false breast), which many
women find physically uncomfortable as well as
inconvenient.

Precautions
Not all women are good candidates for breast
reconstruction. Overall poor physical health, or specific problems such as cigarette smoking, obesity, high
blood pressure, or diabetes, will increase the chance of
complications. Also, a difficult and/or prolonged
recovery period or failure of the reconstruction may
be a result. A woman’s physical ability to cope with
major surgery and recuperation also need to be
considered.

Breast reconstruction is done in two stages, with
the ultimate goal of creating a breast which looks and
feels as natural as possible. It is important to remember that while a good result may mimic a normal
breast closely, there will inevitably be scars and loss
of sensation. The reconstructed breast cannot be
exactly like the original.
The first step is to form a structure called a breast
mound. This can be accomplished using artificial
materials called breast implants, or by using tissues
from other parts of the woman’s body. The second

Latissimus dorsi procedure

TRAM flap procedure
Breast reconstruction surgery may be performed by inserting an artificial substance, or implant, to replace breast tissue.
Autologous reconstruction, in which a woman’s own tissues are used, includes the latissimus dorsi flap, where skin and muscle
taken from the back is rotated around to the breast area, and the TRAM flap, in which abdominal fat and muscle are tunneled
under the skin to the breast area. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)

step involves creating a balance between the newly
constructed breast and the breast on the opposite
side. The nipple and areolar complex (darker area
around the nipple) are recreated. This is usually done
several months after the mound is created, to allow
swelling to go down. Other procedures may be necessary, such as lifting the opposite breast (mastopexy),

or making it larger or smaller to match the reconstructed breast.
Timing, immediate or delayed reconstruction
While immediate reconstruction (IR) is not recommended for women with breast cancer who need to
undergo other, more important treatments, breast

reconstruction can be done almost anytime. It even can
be done during the same procedure as the mastectomy,
or it can be delayed. There are psychological benefits to
IR. The ability to return to normal activities and routines is often enhanced when reconstruction follows
immediately after mastectomy. A better appearance
may result from IR. There is less skin removal, often
resulting in a shorter scar. The surgeon is better able to
preserve the normal boundaries of the breast, so it is
easier to match the opposite breast more closely.
The cost of IR is generally lower than the cost of
delayed reconstruction (DR). There is one fewer operation and hospital stay. Surgeon’s fees may be lower for
a combined procedure than for two separate surgeries.
There are disadvantages of IR as well. The surgery
itself is longer, causing more time under anesthesia.
Post-operative pain and recovery time will be greater
than for mastectomy alone.
Other authorities contend that delayed reconstruction (DR) offers different physical and psychological advantages. The initial mastectomy procedure
alone takes less time, and has a shorter recovery period
and less pain than mastectomy and IR. The patient
has more time to adjust to her diagnosis and recover
from additional therapy. She is better able to research
her options, and to formulate realistic goals for
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The psychological stress of living without a breast
is a disadvantage of DR. The extra procedure DR
entails results in higher costs. Although initial recovery is faster, an additional recuperation period is
required after the delayed operation.
Type of reconstruction
There are two basic choices for breast reconstruction. The breast tissue can be replaced with an implant
or the breast is created using some of the woman’s own
tissues (autologous reconstruction).
ARTIFICIAL IMPLANTS. In general, implant procedures take less time, and are less expensive than autologous ones. Implants are breast shaped pouches.
They are made of silicone outer shells, which may be
smooth or textured. The inside may contain silicone
gel, saline (salt water), or a combination of both.

An implant may be a fixed volume type, which
cannot change its size. Implants that have the capacity
to be filled after insertion are called tissue expanders.
These may be temporary or permanent.
The initial procedure for any implant insertion
uses the mastectomy incision to make a pocket of
tissue, usually underneath the chest wall muscle. In
DR, the mastectomy scar may be re opened and used
for this purpose, or a more cosmetic incision may be
made. The implant is inserted into the pocket, the skin
is stretched as needed and stitched closed.
If there is inadequate tissue to achieve the desired
size, or a naturally sagging breast is desired, a tissue
expander is used. It resembles a partially deflated
balloon, with an attached valve or port through
which saline can be injected. After the initial surgical
incision is healed, the woman returns to the doctor’s
office, on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, to have small
amounts of saline injected. Injections can continue for
about six to eight weeks, until the preferred size is
obtained. In some cases it may be overfilled, and
later partially deflated to allow for a more pliable,
natural result. A temporary tissue expander will be
removed after several months and replaced with a
permanent implant.
IR surgery using an implant takes approximately
two to three hours, and usually requires up to a three
day hospital stay. Implant insertion surgery, as part of
DR, takes one to two hours and can sometimes be

done as an outpatient, or it or it may entail overnight
hospitalization.
AUTOLOGUS RECONSTRUCTION. Attached flap
and free flap are two types of surgery where a woman’s
tissue is used in reconstruction. An attached flap uses
skin, muscle, and fat, leaving blood vessels attached to
their original source of blood. The flap is maneuvered
to the reconstruction site, keeping its original blood
supply for nourishment. This may also be known as a
pedicle flap. The second kind of surgery is called a free
flap. This also uses skin, muscle, and fat, but severs the
blood vessels, and attaches them to other vessels where
the new breast is to be created. The surgeon uses a
microscope to accomplish this delicate task of sewing
blood vessels together. Sometimes the term microsurgery is used to refer to free flap procedures. Either type
of surgery may also be called a myocutaneous flap,
referring to the skin and muscle used.

The skin and muscle used in autologous reconstruction can come from one of several possible places
on the body, including the abdomen (TRAM flap or
‘‘tummy tuck’’), the back (latissimus dorsi flap), or the
buttocks (gluteus maximus free flap).

Routine preoperative preparations, such as taking
nothing to eat or drink the night before surgery are
needed for reconstructive procedures. Blood transfusions are often necessary for autologous reconstructive surgeries. The patient may donate her own blood,
and/or have family and friends donate several weeks
before the surgery.
Emotional preparation is also important. Breast
reconstruction will not resolve a psychological problem
the woman had before mastectomy, nor make an
unstable relationship strong. An expectation of physical perfection is unrealistic. A woman who cites any of
these reasons for reconstruction shows that she has not
been adequately informed or prepared. Complete
understanding of the benefits and limitations of this
surgery is necessary for a satisfactory result.

Aftercare
Finishing the reconstruction
Other procedures may be necessary to achieve the
goal of symmetrical breasts. It may be necessary to
make the opposite breast larger (augmentation), smaller (reduction), or higher (mastopexy). These, or any
other refinements should be completed before the
creation of a nipple and areola. Tissue to form the
new nipple may come from the reconstructed breast
itself, the opposite breast, or a more distant donor site,
such as the inner thigh or behind the ear. The nipple
and areolar construction is usually an outpatient procedure. A final step, often done in the doctor’s office, is
tattooing the new nipple and areola, to match the
color of the opposite nipple and areola as closely as
possible.
Insurance
Insurance coverage for breast reconstruction varies widely. Some policies will allow procedures on the
affected breast, but refuse to pay for alterations to the
opposite breast. Other plans may cover the cost of an
external prosthesis, or reconstructive surgery, but not
both. As of January 1998, 25 states had different laws
regarding required insurance coverage for post mastectomy reconstruction.
Implants may pose additional insurance concerns.
Some companies will withdraw coverage for women
with implants, or add a disclaimer for future implant654

The length of the hospital stay, recovery period,
and frequency of visits to the doctor after surgery varies
considerably with the different kinds of reconstruction.
In general, autologous procedures require longer hospitalization and recovery time than implant procedures.
Bandages and drainage tubes remain in place for at
least a day for all surgeries. Microsurgical or free flaps
are most closely monitored in the first day or two after
surgery. The circulation to the breast may be checked as
often as every hour. Complete breast reconstruction
requires at least one additional surgery to create a
nipple and areola. Scars may remain red and raised
for a month or longer. The true, final appearance of
the breasts will not be visible for at least one year.

Risks
Some women have reported various types of autoimmune related connective-tissue disorders, which
they attribute to their implants–usually involving silicone gel implants. Lawsuits have been filed against the
manufacturers of implants. Food and Drug
Administration guidelines, issued in 1992, now limit
their use to women who need to replace an existing
silicone gel-filled implant, have had surgery for breast
cancer, or have a medical condition which results in
serious breast abnormality. In addition, patients must
sign a consent form which details the potential risks of
silicone gel-filled implants, and become enrolled in a
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The FDA issued a status report on Breast Implant
Safety in 1995, and revised it in March 1997. It noted
that studies so far have not shown a serious increase
in the risk of recognized autoimmune diseases in
women with silicone gel-filled breast implants. It also
addressed concerns about other complications and
emphasized the need for further study of this issue.
There are a number of risks common to any surgical procedure such as bleeding, infection, anesthesia
reaction, or unexpected scarring. Hematoma (accumulation of blood at the surgical site), or seroma (collection of fluid at the surgical site) can delay healing if not
drained. Any breast reconstruction also poses a risk of
asymmetry and/or the need for unplanned surgical revision. Persistent pain is another potential complication
possible with all types of breast reconstruction.
Implants have some unique problems that may
develop. A thick scar, also called a capsule, forms
around the implant, as part of the body’s normal
reaction to a foreign substance. Capsular contracture
occurs when the scar becomes firm or hardened. This
may cause pain and/or change the texture and appearance of the breast. Implants can rupture and leak,
deflate, or become displaced. The chances of capsular
contracture or rupture increase with the age of the
implant. These complications can usually be remedied
with outpatient surgery to loosen the capsule or
remove and/or replace the implant as needed. There
is some evidence that using implants with textured
surfaces may decrease the incidence of these problems.
An implant tends to remain firm indefinitely. It will
not grow larger or smaller as the woman’s weight
changes. Asymmetry can develop if a woman gains
or loses a large amount of weight.
The autologous procedures all carry a risk of flap
failure–loss of blood supply to the tissue forming the
new breast. If a large portion of the flap develops
inadequate blood supply, another reconstructive technique may be necessary. TRAM flap procedures can
result in decreased muscle tone and weakness in the
abdomen and/or abdominal hernia. Arm weakness
may occur after latissimus dorsi flap surgery.

Normal results
A normal result of breast reconstruction depends
on the woman’s goals and expectations. It will not be
the same as the breast it replaces. In general, it should
be similar in size and shape to the opposite breast, but
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

will have less sensation and be less mobile than a
natural breast. A reconstruction using implants will
usually be firmer and rounder than the other breast. It
may feel cooler to touch, depending on the amount of
tissue over it. Scars are unavoidable, but should be as
unobtrusive as possible.
Breast reconstruction surgery may be performed
by inserting an artificial substance, or implant, to
replace breast tissue. Autologous reconstruction, in
which a woman’s own tissues are used, includes the
latissimus dorsi flap, where skin and muscle taken
from the back is rotated around to the breast area,
and the TRAM flap, in which abdominal fat and
muscle are tunneled under the skin to the breast area.

I Breast reduction
Definition
Breast reduction is a surgical procedure performed in order to decrease the size of the breasts.

Purpose
Women with very large breasts (macromastia or
mammary hyperplasia) seek breast reduction for relief
of pain in the back, shoulder, and neck. They may also
feel uncomfortable about their breast size and have
difficulty finding clothing that will fit properly.
Additionally, breast reduction may be needed after
reconstructive surgery following the surgical removal
of cancerous breast tissue (mastectomy), to make the
breasts more symmetric.
Men who have enlarged breasts (gynecomastia)
may also be candidates for breast reduction.
However, excessive alcohol intake, smokingmarijuana,
or using anabolic steroids may cause gynecomastia,
and surgery is not recommended for men who continue to use these products.

Breast reduction

long range study. Saline filled implants are permitted
for all uses, although manufacturers must collect data
on possible risks.

Breast self-examination

KEY TERMS
Gynecomastia—Overly developed or enlarged
breasts in a male.
Macromastia—Excessive size of the breasts.
Mammary hyperplasia—Increased size of the breast.

Precautions
Breast reduction is not recommended for women
whose breasts are not fully developed or who plan to
breast feed.

Description
Breast reduction may also be called reduction mammaplasty. It is most often done in the hospital, under
general anesthetic. However, studies have suggested that
an outpatient procedure, using local anesthetic and mild
sedation may be appropriate for some patients. The
operation takes approximately two to four hours. The
most commonly made incision encircles the areola (darkened area around the nipple) and extends downward
and around the underside of the breast. This produces
the least conspicuous scar. The excess tissue, fat, and
skin are removed, and the nipple and areola are repositioned. In certain cases, liposuction (fat suctioning) is
used to remove extra fat from the armpit area. A hospital stay of up to three days may be needed for recovery.
If deemed medically necessary, breast reduction is
covered by some insurance plans. However, a specified
amount of breast tissue may need to be removed in
order to qualify for coverage. Surgeon’s fees range
from $4,800-$6,500 and up.

Preparation
Consultation between surgeon and patient is
important to ensure that the woman understands and
agrees with the expected final results of the procedure.
Measurements and photographs may be taken. Many
doctors also recommend a mammogram before the
operation, to make sure there is no cancer.

Aftercare
After the surgery, an elastic bandage or special
supportive bra is placed over gauze bandages and drainage tubes. The bandages and tubes are removed in a
day or two. The bra will need to be worn around the
clock for several weeks. Stitches are removed one to
656

three weeks after the operation. Normal activities,
including sexual relations may be restricted for several
weeks. Scars will typically remain red, and perhaps
lumpy for up to several months, but will gradually fade
and become less noticeable. It may take up to a year
before the breasts achieve their final position and size.

Risks
Risks common to any operation include bleeding,
infection, anesthesia reactions, or unexpected scarring.
Breast reduction may result in decreased feeling in the
breasts or nipples and/or impaired ability to breastfeed.
When healing is complete, the breasts may be slightly
uneven, or the nipples may be asymmetric.

Normal results
Smaller breast size should be achieved, and with
that, the accompanying pain and discomfort should be
alleviated.

I Breast self-examination
Definition
A breast self-examination (BSE) is an inspection
by a woman of her breasts to detect breast cancer.

Purpose
A BSE is one of three tests the American Cancer
Society recommends to help detect breast cancer in its
earliest stages. By regularly examining her own
breasts, a woman is more likely to find any changes
that may have occurred. The best time to perform a
BSE is about a week after a woman’s period ends,
when her breasts are not tender or swollen. If her
periods are not regular, a BSE should be completed
on the same day every month. A BSE should also be
regularly completed by women who are pregnant,
breastfeeding, or have breast implants. By combining
a BSE with a mammography and clinical breast

trouble signs that should not be ignored include:


change in breast size or shape



dimpling or puckering of the skin



redness, swelling, or warmth that does not go away



a pain in one area that does not vary with a woman’s
monthly cycle

a nipple that pulls in



discharge from the nipple that begins suddenly and

When lying down, place a pillow under the right
shoulder and position the right arm behind the
head. Using the finger pads of the three middle fingers on the left hand, check the entire breast area.
Use small circles and follow an up-and-down pattern
while pressing firmly enough to know how the breast
feels from month to month. This exam should then
be repeated on the left breast using the finger pads of
the right hand with the pillow under the left shoulder.
When standing before a mirror, any changes in the
shape or look of the breasts should be checked. In
order to look for any skin or nipple changes such as
dimpling or nipple discharge, the arms should first be
placed at the sides and then overhead. Hands are
then placed firmly on hips to flex chest muscles, and
then the body should be bent forward.
When taking a shower, the right arm should be
raised. By using soapy hands and fingers flat the
right breast and outer part of the breast can be
examined. The same small circles and up-and-down
pattern used when lying down should be used in an
upright position. Repeat on the left breast.

Preparation
Before beginning a monthly BSE, a woman’s
breasts should be completely exposed.

Normal results
Each woman’s breasts has their own normal look
and feel. By completing a BSE each month, a woman
can determine what is normal for her and check for
changes that may arise. A regular pattern of lumpiness
in the breasts is normal.

Abnormal results

I Breast ultrasound
Definition
Breast ultrasound (or sonography) is an imaging
technique for diagnosing breast disease, such as cancer. It uses harmless, high frequency sound waves to
form an image (sonogram). The sound waves pass
through the breast and bounce back or echo from
various tissues to form a picture of the internal structures. It is not invasive and involves no radiation.

Purpose
Breast ultrasound may be used in several ways.
The most common application is to investigate a
specific area of the breast where a problem is suspected. A palpable lump and/or a lump or density

examination, a woman is offered the best opportunity
for reducing chances of death from breast cancer
through early detection. Close to 90% of breast cancers are found through a BSE. The American Cancer
Society recommends that beginning at the age of 20,
women complete a BSE each month by feeling for
lumps or anything suspicious, as well as looking at
their breasts carefully in a mirror for any changes in
contour, swelling, dimpling, puckering of the skin, or
changes in the nipple.

Breast ultrasound

KEY TERMS
Cyst—A thin-walled, fluid-filled benign structure
in the breast.
Ductal carcinoma—A type of cancer that accounts
for as much as 80% of breast cancers. These tumors
feel bigger than they look on ultrasound or
mammogram.
Fibroadenoma—A benign breast growth made up
of fibrous tissue. It is the most common mass in
women under 35 years of age, and is found in
both breasts in 3% of cases.

discovered by x-ray imaging (mammogram) can be
further evaluated by ultrasound. It is especially helpful in distinguishing between a fluid-filled cyst and a
solid mass. It also can identify small lesions that are
too tiny to be felt.
Breast ultrasound is often the first study performed to evaluate masses in women under 35 whose
mammograms can be difficult to interpret due to
the density of their breast tissue. In 2003, a new
study found that ultrasound was more accurate than
mammography at diagnosing breast cancer in women
under age 45. However, mammography still works as
a screening tool, with breast ultrasound as the followup examination. Another study in that year found that
combining ultrasound with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) direction greatly improved diagnostic
decisions about breast cancer lesions. The lesions
detected by MRI could also be localized using ultrasound needle guidance for follow-up biopsy.
The lack of radiation used with ultrasound makes
it ideal for studying breast abnormalities in women
who are pregnant. Assessing breast implants for leakage or rupture is another use for ultrasound. Breast
inflammation, where pockets of infection or abscesses
may form, can be diagnosed and monitored by
ultrasound.
Thickened and swollen breast skin may be a sign
of inflammatory breast cancer. Ultrasound can sometimes identify a cancerous growth within the breast
causing the thickened skin. These cases are usually
followed by a core biopsy guided by ultrasound.
Breast ultrasound is employed to observe and
guide a needle for several interventional procedures.
These include cyst aspiration, fine needle aspiration,
large core needle biopsy (as a first step in determining

Infiltrating lobular carcinoma—A type of cancer
that accounts for 8% to 10% of breast cancers. In
breasts that are especially dense, ultrasound can be
useful in identifying these masses.
Microcalcifications—Tiny flecks that are too small

show up on ultrasound and mammogram.
Mucinous (colloid) carcinoma—A type of cancer
that accounts for 1% to 2% of breast cancers.
Resembles medullary carcinoma in ultrasound and
mammogram, but usually affects older women.
Nonpalpable—Cannot be felt by hand. In cancer,
growths that are nonpalpable are too small to be felt,
but may be seen on ultrasound or mammogram.
Papillary carcinoma—A type of breast cancer that
primarily occurs in older women. On ultrasound,
this type of tumor may look like a solid or complex
mass, or it may show up as solid tissue protruding
into a cyst.

for approximately 1% to 2% of breast cancers. Can

treatment for a lesion that is likely to be cancerous),
and needle localization in surgical breast biopsy.
Biopsies guided by ultrasound have distinct advantages. Patients usually find that the procedure is
less traumatic and more comfortable than surgical
biopsies. Ultrasound is known for its accuracy in
determining how far a cancerous growth extends
into the surrounding tissue in lesions that cannot be
felt. Biopsies guided by ultrasound are generally less
costly than surgical biopsies. Additionally, if the
abnormality that requires biopsy can be seen on both
a mammogram and ultrasound, an ultrasound-guided
biopsy is often more comfortable for the patient as no
compression is necessary.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Ultrasound can be done in a doctor’s office or
another outpatient setting, such as a hospital or imaging center.
The patient removes her clothing from the waist
up and puts on a hospital gown, open in the front. She
lies on her back or side on an examining table. A gel
that enhances sound transmission is spread over the
area to be examined. The technologist then places a
transducer, an instrument about the size of an electric
shaver, against the skin. The images from reflected
sound waves appear on a monitor screen.
A physician called a radiologist interprets the
images obtained from ultrasound imaging. In 2003, it
was reported that new computer-aided diagnosis
(CAD) technology that had recently been widely
added to mammography may help improve ultrasound as well. The CAD system uses computer algorithms applied to a three-dimensional ultrasound
image to assign scores to mass characteristics.
Though the technology will not replace human observation and judgment, it may soon be added to support
the radiologist’s interpretation.
A good ultrasound study is difficult to obtain if
the patient is unable to remain quietly in one position.
Obesity may hinder clear viewing of internal structures, and the accuracy of an ultrasound study is
highly dependent on the skill of the person performing
the examination. The images recorded vary with the
angle and pressure of the transducer and the equipment settings. The examination may take from 30 to
45 minutes. Most insurance plans cover the cost of an
ultrasound examination.

Normal results
An ultrasound examination may reveal either normal tissue or a benign condition such as a cyst.
Ultrasound can confidently diagnose a benign structure that has certain characteristics of a simple cyst. In
the case of a simple cyst with no symptoms, additional
treatment beyond continued observation is usually not
needed.

Abnormal results
A potentially malignant mass can be identified by
breast ultrasound. Abnormal results fall into the following categories: benign fibrous nodule, complex
cyst, suspicious lesion, and lesion highly suggestive of
cancer. In cases where ultrasound shows the presence
of a complex cyst or fibrous nodule, a biopsy is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

justified because 10% to 15% of these growths are
malignant. Lesions falling into the last two categories
(suspicious or highly suggestive of cancer) have a
higher chance of being cancerous, and should be investigated further, either by biopsy or surgery.
Breast cancers such as the following may be identified on ultrasound: ductal carcinoma, infiltrating
lobular carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, mucinous
(colloid) carcinoma, tubular carcinoma, and papillary carcinoma. On ultrasound, the shape of a lesion
and the type of edges it has can sometimes indicate if
it is benign or cancerous, but there are exceptions.
For example, benign fibroadenomas are usually oval,
and some cancers can be similarly shaped. Cancerous
tumors usually have jagged edges, but some benign
growths can have these edges as well. Ultrasound is
not a definitive test. Tissue diagnosis is often
required.

I Breech birth
Definition
Breech birth is the delivery of a fetus (unborn
baby) hind end first. Between 3-4% of fetuses will
start labor in the breech position, which is a potentially dangerous situation.
659

Breech Birth

Approximately 3-4% of babies will start labor in the breech
(buttocks first) position. While this is a potentially dangerous situation, many full-term babies can be safely delivered
from the breech position. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators
Group.)

Description
Throughout most of pregnancy, the developing
fetus is completely free to move around within the
uterus. Between 32-36 weeks, it becomes so large that
movement is restricted. It is much harder for the fetus
to turn over, so whatever position it has assumed by
this point is likely to be the same position that he or she
will be in when labor begins.
For reasons that are not fully understood, almost
all unborn babies settle into a head down position. The
fetus is upside down in the uterus, and the head will
lead the way during the birth process.
Unfortunately, some fetuses do not cooperate.
Most of these are in the breech position. The buttocks
lead the way out of the uterus, and the legs are folded
in front of the body (frank breech). Delivery from the
breech position poses far more risks than delivery head
first (vertex position).
The biggest part of the fetus’s body is usually its
head. If the head fits through the mother’s pelvis, then
the rest of the fetus’s body should slip out fairly easily.
If the fetus is born bottom first, it is possible that
the body will fit through the mother’s pelvis, but the
baby’s head will get stuck at the level of the chin. This
condition, known as a trapped head, is very dangerous.
660

When the baby’s head comes first, it has a chance
to ‘‘mold’’ during labor. The bones of the baby’s skull
are not yet fastened together the way they are in a child
or adult’s skull, meaning that the bones of the baby’s
skull can move. During the long hours of labor the
skull can change shape to fit through the pelvis more
easily, which is why many babies are born with a ‘‘cone
head’’. If the baby is born from the breech position,
the skull does not have a chance to change shape to fit
the pelvis, and it is even more likely to get stuck.
If the baby’s head gets trapped, the possibility of
injury is high. Once the baby’s body is born, the umbilical cord usually stops pulsating (just as it would
during a normal delivery). This cuts off the oxygen
supply from the mother to the baby. If the baby’s head
is still inside the uterus the baby cannot yet breathe on
its own. Therefore, it is essential to deliver the baby as
quickly as possible.
The life saving attempts to deliver the baby’s head
can cause injury to the baby’s neck or head resulting in
permanent handicaps. In extreme cases, if the baby
cannot be delivered within a few minutes, the baby
might die. Obviously, it is critical to avoid a breech
delivery with a trapped head.
Of course, many babies are safely delivered from
the breech position. There are certain factors that
make a breech delivery more likely to be successful: if
ultrasound (a technique that uses sound waves to
visualize the fetus) shows that the fetus is in the frank
breech position, the fetus’s head is tucked on its chest,
and the fetus is not big, it is less likely that its head will
get stuck.
Among breech babies born after the full ninemonth term, smaller babies usually do better. This is
not true for premature babies. Premature babies are
more likely to have a trapped head because the body of
a premature baby is usually much smaller than his or
her head. Premature babies are generally not delivered
from the breech position.
The risks of vaginal breech delivery can be
avoided by delivering the baby through a surgical
procedure (cesarean section, also known as c-section).
For the past twenty years, cesarean section has been
recommended when the fetus is breech. More recently,
many providers have offered the option of version,
attempting to turn the fetus within the uterus to a
head first position before labor begins.
Version is based on a very simple idea. If a fetus in
the breech position does a somersault, it will end up
head down. During a version, the obstetrician tries to
make the fetus do a somersault.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

During the procedure, the obstetrician places his
or her hands on the mother’s abdomen to feel the
location of the unborn baby’s buttocks and head.
The buttocks are lifted up slightly and the doctor
pushes on the baby’s head to encourage him to perform a somersault. It may take several tries before the
fetus cooperates, but over half will eventually turn.
A version is not appropriate for every fetus who is
in the breech position at the end of pregnancy. It can
only be tried if there is one fetus in the uterus, if the
placenta is not lying in front of the fetus, and if the
umbilical cord does not appear to be wrapped around
the fetus at any point.

Causes and symptoms
The cause of breech birth is not known. There are
generally no identifiable symptoms. However, some
women can tell the position of the fetus by where
they feel the fetus kicking. Most women cannot tell
what position the fetus is in at any given moment.

Diagnosis
A health care provider can often tell the position
of the fetus by feeling it through the wall of the
mother’s abdomen. Another clue to the position is
the location where the heartbeat is heard best. If the
fetus’s heartbeat is best heard below the level of the
mother’s navel, it is likely to be positioned head first.
On the other hand, if the heartbeat is best heard above
the level of the navel, it is likely to be breech.
The only way to really be sure, however, is to do
an ultrasound exam. Using this technique it is very
easy to tell the position of the fetus.

Treatment
If a fetus is in the breech position in the last weeks
of pregnancy, there are three possible courses of
action: Cesarean section, attempted version, or vaginal breech delivery.
Cesarean section is the most common way to deliver a breech baby. This surgical procedure carries
more risk for the mother, but many women prefer to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

take the risk of surgery on themselves rather than let
the baby face the risks of breech delivery.
Version is gaining in popularity. Version is a medical procedure in which the obstetrician tries to turn
the breech fetus to the head first position. Version is
successful more than 50% of the time. However, some
babies who are successfully turned will turn back to
the breech position after the procedure is done.
Some women choose breech vaginal delivery. This
should only be attempted if ultrasound shows that the
fetus is in a favorable breech position. Most babies
will do very well during a breech delivery, but it is
always possible that the fetus will be injured, perhaps
seriously.

Prevention
There is no way to prevent a fetus from settling
into the breech position at the end of pregnancy. A
woman who has had one breech fetus is more likely
than average to have another.

I Bronchiectasis
Definition
Bronchiectasis is a condition in which an area of
the bronchial tubes is permanently and abnormally
widened (dilated), with accompanying infection.

Description
The bronchial tubes are the networks of branching
tubes which deliver air to the tiny sacs of the lungs
(alveoli). In bronchiectasis, the diameter of the bronchi
is unusually large. Examination of the walls of the

Bronchiectasis

A version should only be done in a hospital, with
an ultrasound machine used to guide the obstetrician
in turning the fetus. The fetus should be monitored
with a fetal monitor before and after the version. Some
obstetricians give the mother an injection of medication to relax the mother’s uterus and prevent any
contractions.

Bronchiectasis

KEY TERMS
Bronchi—The network of tubular passages which
carry air to the lung and allow air to be expelled
from the lungs.
Cilia—Hair-like projections which line the bronchial tubes (also present in other areas of the body).
Normal cilia beat consistently, sweeping the
bronchi clean of bacteria, viruses, and mucus.

bronchial tubes reveals destruction of the normal structural elements, with replacement by scar tissue. Pus
collects within the bronchi, and the normal flow of
oxygen into the lungs, and carbon dioxide out of the
lungs (air exchange) is impaired. The bronchi show
signs of inflammation, with swelling and invasion by a
variety of immune cells. The inflamed areas show signs
of increased growth of blood vessels. The area of the
lung which should be served by a diseased bronchial
tube is also prone to inflammation and infection.

Causes and symptoms
Prior to the widespread use of immunizations,
bronchiectasis was often the result of a serious infection with either measles or whooping cough. Currently,
viruses that cause influenza (flu) or influenza-like
syndromes, as well as a number of bacteria may precede the development of bronchiectasis. Patients who
have been infected with tuberculosis or the virus which
causes AIDS (HIV or human immunodeficiency virus)
also have an increased chance of bronchiectasis.
A number of pre-existing conditions may cause an
individual to be more susceptible than normal to infection, with increased risk of bronchiectasis developing.
These conditions include disorders of cilia, and
immune disorders.
Cilia are the tiny hairs which usually line the
bronchial tubes. Cilia wave constantly, sweeping the
bronchial tubes clean of bacterial or viral invaders,
and cleaning away excess secretions (mucus, sputum)
which may be produced by the bronchi. When these
cilia are abnormal or absent at birth, various bacterial
or viral invaders may remain in the respiratory tract,
multiply, and cause serious infections.
662

Immune disorders include decreased production
of certain immune chemicals (immunoglobulins)
which usually serve to fight off infection by bacterial
or viral invasion. When these immunoglobulins are
not produced in large enough quantity, bacterial
and viral invaders are not effectively killed off, and
infection occurs.
Other causes of bronchiectasis include an abnormally blocked (obstructed) airway. This can be due to
tumor growth within the bronchial tube, or due to a
child accidentally inhaling a small object which then
blocks off the bronchial tube. People with the disease
called cystic fibrosis (CF) often have their bronchial
tubes obstructed by the thick, sticky mucus which is a
hallmark of CF. Toxic exposures (breathing ammonia, for example) can harm the bronchi, and lead to
bronchiectasis. An extreme allergic response of the
immune system to the presence of certain fungi (especially one called Aspergillus) can also damage the
bronchial tubes enough to result in bronchiectasis.
Symptoms of bronchiectasis include constant
cough and the production of infected sputum (sputum
is a mixture of mucus and pus), which may be bloody.
In some cases, there may be wheezing and shortness of
breath. The constant, low-level of infection may flare,
resulting in increased production of sputum, worsening of the cough, and fever. The area of the lung served
by the affected bronchial tube may become severely
infected, resulting in pneumonia.

Diagnosis
Chest x ray may reveal evidence of bronchiectasis,
and CT scans are particularly good at revealing the
thick, dilated bronchial walls of bronchiectasis.
Sputum will need to be collected and cultured (grown
in a laboratory dish), in order to examine it microscopically for the specific type of organism responsible
for infection. A careful search for other underlying
diseases is important, looking in particular for ciliary
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment
Treatment should involve efforts to resolve any
underlying disorder. Infections will require antibiotics,
obstruction may require the removal of a foreign
object or tumor. Medications are available to help
thin the sputum, so that it can be more effectively
coughed up. Rhythmic clapping on the chest and
back, while the patient assumes a number of positions
(head down, primarily), may help the lungs to drain
more effectively. This is called chest physical therapy,
or percussion and postural drainage.
When a particular area of the lung is constantly
and severely infected, surgery may be needed to
remove it. When bleeding occurs from irritated bronchial tubes and overgrown bronchial blood vessels,
surgery may be required either to remove an area of
the bronchial tube, or to inject the bleeding blood
vessel with a material to stop the bleeding.
In some patients, bronchiectasis eventually leads
to a constantly low level of blood oxygen, despite
other treatments. These patients usually have an associated increase in the size of the right side of their
hearts, along with a decrease in the heart’s ability to
pump blood through the lungs. Some patients with
extremely severe symptoms and disability have been
treated with lung transplantation.

Prognosis
Prognosis varies widely, depending on how widespread or focal the bronchiectasis, and the presence of
other underlying disorders.

I Bronchiolitis
Definition
Bronchiolitis is an acute viral infection of the
small air passages of the lungs called the bronchioles.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS
Bronchiole—A thin air passage in the lung that
branches off a larger airway.
Congenital—A condition that an individual is born
with.

Description
Bronchiolitis is extremely common. It occurs
most often in children between the ages of two and
24 months, with peak infection occurring between
three and six months of age. About 25% of infants
have bronchiolitis during their first year, and 95%
have had the disease by their second birthday. In
temperate climates, bronchiolitis peaks from winter
to late spring. In subtropical climates, the disease
peaks from October to February.
Children who attend daycare or who live in
crowded conditions and those who are exposed to
second-hand smoke at home are more likely to develop
bronchiolitis. Premature infants and children born with
heart and lung defects or HIV/AIDS are more likely to
have severe, life-threatening infections. Bronchiolitis
occurs more often in boys than girls, with boys being
hospitalized at 1.5 times the rate of girls. Bronchiolitis
is a significant cause of respiratory disease worldwide.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has funded
research to develop a vaccine against the disease, but
thus attempts have been unsuccessful.

Causes and symptoms
Bronchiolitis is caused by several different viruses.
The most common of these is respiratory syncytial
virus (RVS), which is responsible for about 100,000
hospitalizations of children under age four each year.
Two subtypes of RSV have been identified, one of
which causes most of the severe bronchiolitis infections. In addition, bronchiolitis can be caused by influenza, parainfluenza, and adenoviruses, all of which are
common from fall through spring. These viruses are
spread in tiny drops of fluid from an infected person’s
nose and mouth through direct contact, such as shaking hands, or kissing. The viruses can also live several
hours on countertops, toys, or used tissues and easily
infect people who handle contaminated items. The
time from infection to the appearance of symptoms
varies from two to seven days.
Bronchiolitis affects individuals differently
depending on their age. In adults, older children, and
663

Bronchiolitis

abnormalities, cystic fibrosis, or immunoglobulin
deficiencies.

Bronchiolitis

some infants, bronchiolitis viruses causes symptoms
similar to a mild cold—runny nose, stuffy head, and
mild cough. The lungs are not involved, and these
symptoms clear up without any medical treatment. In
some children under age two, the cold-like upper
respiratory symptoms worsen after a day or two. The
lung tissue begins to swell and produce mucus, and
the cells lining the bronchioles begin to slough off
into the air passages. As the airways narrow from
swelling, and mucus accumulation, breathing becomes
difficult, and the child makes a wheezing or whistling
sound with each breath. Lung involvement can occur
quite rapidly.
The most common signs of bronchiolitis involve
the infant’s struggle to breathe. The child may take
50–60 breaths per minute and may develop brief periods when they stop breathing (apnea) and begin to
turn blue (cyanosis). This occurs most often in babies
who were born very prematurely or who are under six
weeks of age and babies with congenital heart and lung
problems and compromised immune systems. Babies
may also stop eating, because it is becomes difficult
for them to swallow and breathe at the same time.
They may have a low fever, cough, and vomiting.

Diagnosis
Bronchiolitis is usually diagnosed through a physical examination by a pediatrician or family physician. The physician often finds an increased heart
rate, rapid, labored breathing, and crackles in the
lungs when the child inhales. Signs of ear infection
(otitis media) and throat infection (pharyngitis) are
sometimes present.
Although laboratory tests are available that can
within in a few hours confirm the presence of RSV,
these tests are not routinely necessary. The oxygen
level in the blood may be measured through pulse
oximetry in babies who are having difficulty breathing.
Inadequate oxygen in the blood is an indication that
hospitalization is necessary. Chest x-rays may be done
on severely ill children to rule out other conditions.

Treatment
The degree of respiratory distress determines
treatment. Individuals with mild symptoms are treated
as if they have a cold with rest, fluids, and a cool
air humidifier. Babies who are struggling to breath
may hospitalized and given supplemental humidified
oxygen. Their breathing will be monitored and if
necessary fluids will be given intravenously to prevent
dehydration. Occasionally infants need mechanical
664

ventilation to fill and empty the lungs until the airways
open.
Those children with compromised immune systems from diseases such as congenital HIV/AIDS
and transplant patients are at highest risk for severe
infections, serious complications, and death. Children
with congenital heart and lung disorders are also at
higher risk, as are infants under six weeks old. These
high risk children may be admitted to pediatric intensive care units and treated with ribvarin (Virazole), a
drug that keeps the virus from reproducing. This drug
is reserved for the most critical cases.

Alternative treatment
Although there are alternative treatments for
cold symptoms, such as echinacea and zinc, parents
should consult their health practitioner about the
appropriateness of using these treatments in very
young children.

Prognosis
The majority of children who get bronchiolitis,
even severe infections, recover without complications
in one to two weeks, although fatigue and a light
cough may linger longer. About 60% of people
develop only cold-like symptoms without lung involvement. However, the disease accounts for about
100,000 pediatric hospitalizations and 4,500 deaths
each year. Deaths usually occur because medical care
is not sought soon enough.
Although many viral illnesses, like chicken pox,
can be contracted only once, after which individuals
develop immunity, people can get bronchiolitis multiple times. However, after the first infection, the symptoms are usually mild.

Prevention
The viruses that cause bronchiolitis spread very
easily, making prevention difficult. Common sense
measures such as frequent hand washing and keeping
children away from crowds and sick individuals are
only partially effective. Certain very high risk babies
can be treated during the peak virus season with
monthly injections of antiviral immunoglobulins to
protect against RSV infection. These injections cost
several thousand dollars per child per season and are
reserved for children whose life could be at risk if they
became infected. Antiviral immunoglobulins are used
only for prevention and are not effective as a treatment
once the infection has been acquired.

I Bronchitis
Definition
Bronchitis is an inflammation of the air passages
between the nose and the lungs, including the windpipe or trachea and the larger air tubes of the lung that
bring air in from the trachea (bronchi). Bronchitis can
either be of brief duration (acute) or have a long course
(chronic). Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a viral
infection, but can also be caused by a bacterial infection and can heal without complications. Chronic
bronchitis is a sign of serious lung disease that may
be slowed but cannot be cured.

Description
Although acute and chronic bronchitis are both
inflammations of the air passages, their causes and
treatments are different. Acute bronchitis is most prevalent in winter. It usually follows a viral infection,
such as a cold or the flu, and can be accompanied by
a secondary bacterial infection. Acute bronchitis
resolves within two weeks, although the cough may
persist longer. Acute bronchitis, like any upper airway
inflammatory process, can increase a person’s likelihood of developing pneumonia.
Anyone can get acute bronchitis, but infants,
young children, and the elderly are more likely to get
the disease because people in these age groups generally
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Acute—Disease or condition characterized by the
rapid onset of severe symptoms.
Bronchi—The larger air tubes of the lung that bring
air in from the trachea.
Chronic—Disease or condition characterized by
slow onset over a long period of time.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)—
A term used to describe chronic lung diseases, like
chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma.
Emphysema—One of the several diseases called
chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, emphysema involves the destruction of air sac walls to
form abnormally large air sacs that have reduced
gas exchange ability and that tend to retain air
within the lungs. Symptoms include labored
breathing, the inability to forcefully blow air out
of the lungs, and an increased susceptibility to
respiratory tract infections.

have weaker immune systems. Smokers and people
with heart or other lung diseases are also at higher
risk of developing acute bronchitis. Individuals exposed
to chemical fumes or high levels of air pollution also
have a greater chance of developing acute bronchitis.
Chronic bronchitis is a major cause of disability
and death in the United States. The American Lung
Association estimates that about 14 million Americans
suffer from the disease. Like acute bronchitis, chronic
bronchitis is an inflammation of airways accompanied by coughing and spitting up of phlegm. In
chronic bronchitis, these symptoms are present for
at least three months in each of two consecutive
years.
Chronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling bronchial
irritants, especially cigarette smoke. Until recently,
more men than women developed chronic bronchitis,
but as the number of women who smoke has
increased, so has their rate of chronic bronchitis.
Because this disease progresses slowly, middle-aged
and older people are more likely to be diagnosed
with chronic bronchitis.
Chronic bronchitis is one of a group of diseases
that fall under the name chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Other diseases in this category
include emphysema and chronic asthmatic bronchitis.
Chronic bronchitis may progress to emphysema, or
both diseases may be present together.

Bronchitis

Causes and symptoms
Acute bronchitis
Acute bronchitis usually begins with the symptoms of a cold, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and
dry cough. However, the cough soon becomes deep
and painful. Coughing brings up a greenish yellow
phlegm or sputum. These symptoms may be accompanied by a fever of up to 102  F (38.8  C). Wheezing
after coughing is common.
In uncomplicated acute bronchitis, the fever and
most other symptoms, except the cough, disappear
after three to five days. Coughing may continue for
several weeks. Acute bronchitis is often complicated
by a bacterial infection, in which case the fever and a
general feeling of illness persist. To be cured, the
bacterial infection should be treated with antibiotics.
Chronic bronchitis
Chronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling respiratory tract irritants. The most common irritant is
cigarette smoke. The American Lung Association
estimates that 80-90% of COPD cases are caused by
smoking. Other irritants include chemical fumes, air
pollution, and environmental irritants, such as mold
or dust.
Chronic bronchitis develops slowly over time. The
cells that line the respiratory system contain fine, hairlike outgrowths from the cell called cilia. Normally,
the cilia of many cells beat rhythmically to move
mucus along the airways. When smoke or other irritants are inhaled, the cilia become paralyzed or snap
off. When this occurs, the cilia are no longer able to
move mucus, and the airways become inflamed, narrowed, and clogged. This leads to difficulty breathing
and can progress to the life-threatening disease
emphysema.
A mild cough, sometimes called smokers’ cough, is
usually the first visible sign of chronic bronchitis.
Coughing brings up phlegm, although the amount varies considerably from person to person. Wheezing and
shortness of breath may accompany the cough.
Diagnostic tests show a decrease in lung function. As
the disease advances, breathing becomes difficult and
activity decreases. The body does not get enough oxygen, leading to changes in the composition of the blood.

Diagnosis
Initial diagnosis of bronchitis is based on observing
the patient’s symptoms and health history. The physician will listen to the patient’s chest with a stethoscope
666

for specific sounds that indicate lung inflammation,
such as moist rales and crackling, and wheezing, that
indicates airway narrowing. Moist rales is a bubbling
sound heard with a stethoscope that is caused by fluid
secretion in the bronchial tubes.
A sputum culture may be performed, particularly
if the sputum is green or has blood in it, to determine
whether a bacterial infection is present and to identify
the disease-causing organism so that an appropriate
antibiotic can be selected. Normally, the patient will
be asked to cough deeply, then spit the material that
comes up from the lungs (sputum) into a cup. This
sample is then grown in the laboratory to determine
which organisms are present. The results are available
in two to three days, except for tests for tuberculosis,
which can take as long as two months.
Occasionally, in diagnosing a chronic lung disorder, the sample of sputum is collected using a procedure called a bronchoscopy. In this procedure, the
patient is given a local anesthetic, and a tube is passed
into the airways to collect a sputum sample.
A pulmonary function test is important in diagnosing chronic bronchitis and other variations of COPD.
This test uses an instrument called a spirometer to
measure the volume of air entering and leaving the
lungs. The test is done in the doctor’s office and is
painless. It involves breathing into the spirometer
mouthpiece either normally or forcefully. Volumes
less than 80% of the normal values indicate an
obstructive lung disease.
To better determine what type of obstructive lung
disease a patient has, the doctor may do a chest x ray,
electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood tests. An electrocardiogram is an instrument that is used to measure
the electrical activity of the heart and is useful in the
diagnosis of heart conditions. Other tests may be used
to measure how effectively oxygen and carbon dioxide
are exchanged in the lungs.

Treatment
Acute bronchitis
When no secondary infection is present, acute
bronchitis is treated in the same way as the common
cold. Home care includes drinking plenty of fluids,
resting, not smoking, increasing moisture in the air
with a cool mist humidifier, and taking acetaminophen
(Datril, Tylenol, Panadol) for fever and pain. Aspirin
should not be given to children because of its association with the serious illness, Reye’s syndrome.
Expectorant cough medicines, unlike cough suppressants, do not stop the cough. Instead they are used
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

If a secondary bacterial infection is present, the
infection is treated with an antibiotic. Patients need
to take the entire amount of antibiotic prescribed.
Stopping the antibiotic early can lead to a return of the
infection. Tetracycline or ampicillin are often used to
treat adults. Other possibilities include trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim or Septra) and the newer
erythromycin-like drugs, such as azithromycin
(Zithromax) and clarithromycin (Biaxin). Children
under age eight are usually given amoxicillin (Amoxil,
Pentamox, Sumox, Trimox), because tetracycline discolors permanent teeth that have not yet come in.
Chronic bronchitis
The treatment of chronic bronchitis is complex
and depends on the stage of chronic bronchitis and
whether other health problems are present. Lifestyle
changes, such as quitting smoking and avoiding secondhand smoke or polluted air, are an important first
step. Controlled exercise performed on a regular basis
is also important.
Drug therapy begins with bronchodilators. These
drugs relax the muscles of the bronchial tubes and
allow increased air flow. They can be taken by mouth
or inhaled using a nebulizer. A nebulizer is a device that
delivers a regulated flow of medication into the airways.
Common bronchodilators include albuterol (Ventolin,
Proventil, Apo-Salvent) and metaproterenol (Alupent,
Orciprenaline, Metaprel, Dey-Dose).
Anti-inflammatory medications are added to
reduce swelling of the airway tissue. Corticosteroids,
such as prednisone, can be taken orally or intravenously. Other steroids are inhaled. Long-term steroid
use can have serious side effects. Other drugs, such as
ipratropium (Atrovent), are given to reduce the quantity of mucus produced.
As the disease progresses, the patient may need
supplemental oxygen. Complications of COPD are
many and often require hospitalization in the latter
stages of the disease.

Alternative treatment
Alternative practitioners focus on prevention by
eating a healthy diet that strengthens the immune
system and practicing stress management. Bronchitis
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

can become serious if it progresses to pneumonia,
therefore, antibiotics may be required. In addition,
however, there are a multitude of botanical and herbal
medicines that can be formulated to treat bronchitis.
Some examples include inhaling eucalyptus or other
essential oils in warm steam. Herbalists recommend a
tea made of mullein (Verbascum thapsus), coltsfoot
(Tussilago farfara), and anise seed (Pimpinella anisum). Homeopathic medicine and traditional Chinese
medicine may also be very useful for bronchitis, and
hydrotherapy can contribute to cleaning the chest and
stimulating immune response.

Prognosis
When treated, acute bronchitis normally resolves
in one to two weeks without complications, although
a cough may continue for several more weeks. The
progression of chronic bronchitis, on the other hand,
may be slowed, and an initial improvement in symptoms may be achieved. Unfortunately, however,
there is no cure for chronic bronchitis, and the disease
can often lead to or coexist with emphysema. Taken
together, all forms of COPD are a leading cause of
death.

Prevention
The best way to prevent bronchitis is not to begin
smoking or to stop smoking. Smokers are ten times
more likely to die of COPD than non-smokers.
Smokers who stop show improvement in lung function. Other preventative steps include avoiding
chemical and environmental irritants, such as air
pollution, and maintaining good overall health.
Immunizations against certain types of pneumonia
(as well as influenza) are an important preventative
measure for anyone with lung or immune system
diseases.

cough up. This type of cough medicine may be helpful
to individuals suffering from bronchitis. People who

for an explanation.

Bronchodilators

I Bronchodilators
Definition
Bronchodilators are medicines that help open the
bronchial tubes (airways) of the lungs, allowing more
air to flow through them.

Purpose
People with asthma have trouble breathing, because
their airways are inflamed and become narrowed.
Normally, air moves smoothly from the mouth and
nose through the airways and into the tiny air sacs of
the lungs as a person breathes in. Breathing out (exhaling) happens automatically when the person stops
breathing in. In a person with asthma, breathing in
(inhaling) is not a problem. Incoming air can slide
around the blockage, because the act of breathing in
makes the airways expand. The problem comes when
the person with asthma tries to breathe out. The air can
no longer get past the blockage, and it remains trapped
in the lungs. The person can then only take shallow
breaths. Bronchodilators work by relaxing the smooth
muscles that line the airways. This makes the airways
open wider and allows air to leave the lungs. These drugs
also are used to relieve breathing problems associated
with emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and other lung
diseases.

Description
Some bronchodilators are inhaled, using a nebulizer
or an inhalation aerosol. Others are taken as injections
or by mouth. Most are available only by prescription,
but a few, such as ephedrine, can be bought without
a physician’s prescription. Examples of bronchodilators are albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), epinephrine
(Primatene), ipratropium (Atrovent), metaproterenol
(Alupent, Metaprel), and terbutaline (Brethine).

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
bronchodilator and may be different for different
patients. The physician who prescribed the drug or
the pharmacist who filled the prescription can recommend correct dosage.

Precautions
Bronchodilators come with patient instructions
that must be carefully read before using the medicine.
If there is any confusion about how to use the

medicine, patients should check with the physician or
pharmacist. These medicines must be used exactly as
directed. Taking larger than recommended doses or
using the medicine too often can lead to serious side
effects and even death.
If symptoms do not improve or if they get worse
after using a bronchodilator, the patient should call a
physician right away.
Although some bronchodilators are available
without a physician’s prescription, these medicines
should not be used unless a physician has diagnosed
the patient’s condition as asthma.
Research shows that frequent bronchodilator use
over time can tighten airway muscles in some people.
Some physicians advise patients to consider controlling asthma with anti-inflammatory drugs including
inhaled steroids such as beclomethasone dipropionate
(Beclovent, Vanceril), flunisolide (AeroBid) or triamcinolone acetonide (Azmacort). A 2004 Canadian study
has questioned a standard practice of increasing steroids
after asthma attacks or worsened symptoms. Also,
research in 2004 showed that people with asthma who
worked closely with their physicians to self-manage
their asthma had fewer attacks, which reduces the need
for bronchodilators. Carefully managing asthma also
reduces visits to the emergency department and
hospitalizations.
Persons with diabetes should be aware that the
bronchodilator epinephrine may raise their blood
sugar levels.

OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using
bronchodilators, people with any of these medical
problems should make sure their physicians are
aware of their conditions:

Some bronchodilator products contain sulfites
that trigger an allergic reaction in certain people.
Anyone who has a sulfite allergy should read the
label carefully or check with a physician or pharmacist

USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Using bronchodilators with certain other drugs may affect the way the
drugs work or may increase the chance of side effects.

Side effects
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if
they use bronchodilators. Before using these drugs, a
physician should be made aware of any of these
conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to any bronchodilator or an inhaled form of
any other drug in the past should let his or her physician know before taking the drugs again. The physician should also be told about any allergies to foods,
dyes, preservatives, or other substances.

Patients who are allergic to soybeans, soy lecithin,
peanuts, or drugs based on atropine should not use the
bronchodilator ipratropium (Atrovent).
PREGNANCY. In studies of laboratory animals,

some bronchodilators cause birth defects or miscarriage when the animals are given doses many times
the usual human dose. Whether these drugs cause such
problems in humans in unknown. Any woman who is
pregnant or plans to become pregnant should check
with her physician before using a bronchodilator.

Some patients have a dry or irritated throat or a
dry mouth after using bronchodilators. To help prevent these problems, gargling and rinsing the mouth or
taking a sip of water after each dose.
The most common side effects are nervousness or
restlessness and trembling. These problems usually go
away as the body adjusts to the drug and do not
require medical treatment. Less common side effects,
such as bad taste in the mouth, coughing, dizziness or
lightheadedness, drowsiness, headache, sweating, fast
or pounding heartbeat, muscle cramps or twitches,
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sleep problems and weakness also may occur and do not need medical attention
unless they do not go away or they interfere with
normal activities.
More serious side effects are not common, but
may occur. If any of the following side effects occur,
the physician who prescribed the medicine should be
contacted as soon as possible:


chest pain or discomfort



irregular or fluttery heartbeat



unusual bruising



hives or rash



swelling

BREASTFEEDING. Some bronchodilators pass into

breast milk. Breastfeeding mothers should check with
their physicians before using bronchodilators.

Bronchodilators

Patients who are using an aerosol bronchodilator
and an aerosol form of either ipratropium or a corticosteroid such as beclomethasone dipropionate
(Beclovent, Vanceril) should use the bronchodilator
first, then wait 5 minutes before using the other medicine. A physician should be consulted before using
any other inhaled medications or other asthma medicines. The physician must determine the proper
amount of time between doses.

Other side effects are possible. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after using a bronchodilator
should get in touch with his or her physician.

Interactions
Bronchodilators may interact with a number of
other medicines. When this happens, the effects of one
or both of the drugs may change or the risk of side
effects may be greater. Anyone who takes these drugs
should let the physician know all other medicines he or
she is taking. Among the drugs that may interact with
bronchodilators are:


monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors)
such as phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine
(Parnate), used to treat depression



other bronchodilators



tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline
(Elavil) and imipramine (Tofranil)



beta blockers such as propranolol (Inderal) and
atenolol (Tenormin), used to control high blood
pressure



digitalis medicines, used to treat heart conditions,
such as digoxin (Lanoxin)



drugs, such as certain diuretics (water pills), that
lower potassium levels



ergoloid mesylates such as Hydergine, used to treat
symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease or multiple small
stokes



ergotamine (Cafergot, Ergostat, and other brands),
used to treat migraine and cluster headaches



the antidepressant maprotiline (Ludiomil).

The list above does not include every drug that
may interact with bronchodilators. Be sure to check
with a physician or pharmacist before combining
bronchodilators with any other prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicine.

I Bronchoscopy
Definition
Bronchoscopy is a procedure in which a cylindrical fiberoptic scope is inserted into the airways. This
scope contains a viewing device that allows the visual
examination of the lower airways.

Purpose
During a bronchoscopy, a physician can visually
examine the lower airways, including the larynx, trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. The procedure is used
to examine the mucosal surface of the airways for
abnormalities that might be associated with a variety
of lung diseases. Its use includes the visualization of
airway obstructions such as a tumor, or the collection
of specimens for the diagnosis of cancer originating in
the bronchi of the lungs (bronchogenic cancer). It can
also be used to collect specimens for culture to diagnose infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. The type
of specimens collected can include sputum (composed
of saliva and discharges from the respiratory passages), tissue samples from the bronchi or bronchioles,
or cells collected from washing the lining of the
bronchi or bronchioles. The instrument used in
bronchoscopy, a bronchoscope, is a slender cylindrical
instrument containing a light and an eyepiece. There
are two types of bronchoscopes, a rigid tube that is
sometimes referred to as an open-tube or ventilating
bronchoscope, and a more flexible fiberoptic tube.
This tube contains four smaller passages—two for
light to pass through, one for seeing through and one
that can accommodate medical instruments that may
be used for biopsy or suctioning, or that medication
can be passed through.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Anesthesia—A drug used to loss of sensation. It is used
to lessen the pain of surgery and medical procedures.
Bronchi—The network of tubular passages that
carry air to the lungs and allow air to be expelled
from the lungs.
Bronchioles—Small airways extending from the
bronchi into the lobes of the lungs.
Bronchoalveolar lavage—Washing cells from the
air sacs at the end of the bronchioles.

Bronchoscopy may be used for the following
purposes:


to diagnose cancer, tuberculosis, lung infection, or
other lung disease



to examine an inherited deformity of the lungs



to remove a foreign body in the lungs, such as a
mucus plug, tumor, or excessive secretions



to remove tissue samples, also known as biopsy, to test
for cancer cells, help with staging the advancement of
the lung cancer, or to treat a tumor with laser therapy



to allow examination of a suspected tumor, obstruction, secretion, bleeding, or foreign body in the airways



to determine the cause of a persistent cough, wheezing, or a cough that includes blood in the sputum



to evaluate the effectiveness of lung cancer treatments

Precautions
Patients not breathing adequately on their own
due to severe respiratory failure may require mechanical ventilation prior to bronchoscopy. It may not be
appropriate to perform bronchoscopy on patients
with an unstable heart condition. All patients must
be constantly monitored while undergoing a bronchoscopy so that any abnormal reactions can be dealt with
immediately.

Trachea—The windpipe.

rigid tube must be used because of its larger size. The
patient will either lie face-up on his/her back or sit
upright in a chair. Medication to decrease secretions,
lessen anxiety, and relax the patient are often given
prior to the procedure. While breathing through the
nose, anesthesia is sprayed into the mouth or nose to
numb it. It will take one to two minutes for the
anesthesia to take effect. Once this happens, the
bronchoscope will be put into the patient’s mouth or
nose and moved down into the throat. While the
bronchoscope is moving down the throat, additional
anesthesia is put into the bronchoscope to numb the
lower parts of the airways. Using the eyepiece, the
physician then observes the trachea and bronchi, and
the mucosal lining of these passageways, looking for
any abnormalities that may be present.
If the purpose of the bronchoscopy is to take
tissue samples or biopsy, forceps or a bronchial
brush are used to obtain cells. If the purpose is to
identify an infectious agent, a bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) can be used to gather fluid for culture purposes.
Also, if any foreign matter is found in the airways, it
can be removed.
Another procedure using bronchoscopy is called
fluorescence bronchoscopy. This can be used to detect
precancerous cells present in the airways. By using a
fluorescent light in the bronchoscope, precancerous tissue will appear dark red, while healthy tissue will appear
green. This technique can help detect lung cancer at
an early stage, so that treatment can be started early.

Description
There are two types of bronchoscopes, a rigid tube
and a fiberoptic tube. Because of its flexibility, the
fiberoptic tube is usually preferred. However, if the
purpose of the procedure is to remove a foreign body
caught in the windpipe or lungs of a child, the more

Alternative procedures
Depending upon the purpose of the bronchoscopy,
alternatives might include a computed tomography
scan (CT) or no procedure at all. Bronchoscopy is
often performed to investigate an abnormality that

shows up on a chest x ray or CT scan. If the purpose is
to obtain biopsy specimens, one option is to perform
surgery, which carries greater risks. Another option is
percutaneous (through the skin) biopsy guided by computed tomography.

Bronchoscope

Preparation
The doctor should be informed of any allergies and
all the medications that the patient is currently taking.
The doctor may instruct the patient not to take medications like aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs, which
interfere with clotting, for a period of time prior to the
procedure. The patient needs to fast for 6 to 12 hours
prior to the procedure and refrain from drinking any
liquids the day of the procedure. The bronchoscopy
takes about 45 to 60 minutes, with results usually available in one day. Prior to the bronchoscopy, several tests
may be done, including a chest x ray and blood work.
Sometimes a bronchoscopy is done under general
anesthesia. Patients usually have an intravenous (IV)
line in the arm. Most likely, the procedure will be done
under local anesthesia, which is sprayed into the nose or
mouth. This is necessary to decrease the gag reflex. A
sedative may also be used to help the patient relax. It is
important that the patient understands that at no time
will the airway be blocked and that oxygen can be
supplied through the bronchoscope. A signed consent
form is necessary for this procedure.

Aftercare
After the bronchoscopy, the patient will be monitored for vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure,
and breathing, while resting in bed. Sometimes
patients have an abnormal reaction to anesthesia. All
saliva should be spit into a basin so that it can be
examined for the presence of blood. If a biopsy was
taken, the patient should not cough or clear the throat
as this might dislodge any blood clot that has formed
and cause bleeding. No food or drink should be consumed for about two hours after the procedure or until
the anesthesia wears off. Diet is gradually progressed
from ice chips and clear liquids to the patient’s regular
diet. There will also be a temporary sore throat and
hoarseness that may last for a few days.

Risks
Minor side effects arise from the bronchoscope
causing abrasion of the lining of the airways. This
results in some swelling and inflammation, as well as
hoarseness caused from abrading the vocal cords. If
this abrasion is more serious, it can lead to respiratory

difficulty or bleeding of the airway lining. A more
serious risk involved in having a bronchoscopy performed is the occurrence of a pneumothorax, due to
puncturing of the lungs, which allows air to escape
into the space between the lung and the chest wall.
These risks are greater with the use of a rigid bronchoscope than with a fiberoptic bronchoscope. If a rigid
tube is used, there is also a risk of chipped teeth.

muscle with C-shaped rings of cartilage at regular

I Brucellosis
Definition
Brucellosis is a bacterial disease caused by members of the Brucella genus that can infect humans but
primarily infects livestock. Symptoms of the disease
include intermittent fever, sweating, chills, aches, and
mental depression. The disease can become chronic
and recur, particularly if untreated.

Description
Also known as undulant fever, Malta fever,
Gibraltar fever, Bang’s disease, or Mediterranean
fever, brucellosis is most likely to occur among those
individuals who regularly work with livestock. The
disease originated in domestic livestock but was
passed on to wild animal species, including the elk
and buffalo of the western United States. In humans,
brucellosis continues to be spread via unpasteurized
milk obtained from infected cows or through contact
with the discharges of cattle and goats during
miscarriage. In areas of the world where milk is not
pasteurized, for example in Latin America and the
Mediterranean, the disease is still contracted by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products. However, in the
United States, the widespread pasteurization of milk
and nearly complete eradication of the infection from
cattle has reduced the number of human cases from
6,500 in 1940 to about 70 in 1994.

Causes and symptoms
The disease is caused by several different species
of parasitic bacteria of the genus Brucella. B. abortus is
found in cattle and can cause cows to abort their

fetuses. B. suis is most often found in hogs and is
more deadly when contracted by humans than the
organism found in cattle. B. melitensis is found in
goats and sheep and causes the most severe illness in
humans. B. rangiferi infects reindeer and caribou, and
B. canis is found in dogs.
A human contracts the disease by coming into
contact with an infected animal and either allowing
the bacteria to enter a cut, breathing in the bacteria, or
by consuming unpasteurized milk or fresh goat cheese
obtained from a contaminated animal. In the United
States, the disease is primarily confined to slaughterhouse workers.
Scientists do not agree about whether brucellosis can be transmitted from one person to another,
although some people have been infected from a
tainted blood transfusion or bone marrow transplant. Newborn babies have also contracted the illness from their mothers during birth. Currently, it is
believed that brucellosis can also be transmitted
sexually.
The disease is not usually fatal, but the intermittent fevers (a source of its nickname, ‘‘undulant
fever’’) can be exhausting. Symptoms usually appear
between five days and a month after exposure and
begin with a single bout of high fever accompanied
by shivering, aching, and drenching sweats that last
for a few days. Other symptoms may include headache,
poor appetite, backache, weakness, and depression.
Mental depression can be so severe that the patient
may become suicidal.
In rare, untreated cases, the disease can become so
severe that it leads to fatal complications, such as
pneumonia or bacterial meningitis. B. melitensis can
cause miscarriages, especially during the first three
months of pregnancy. The condition can also occur

inflammation, swelling, ulceration, or anatomical
abnormalities. The bronchoscopy may also reveal the
presence of abnormal substances in the trachea and
bronchi. If samples are taken, the results could indicate cancer, disease-causing agents or other lung disease. Other abnormalities include constriction or
narrowing (stenosis), compression, dilation of vessels,
or abnormal branching of the bronchi. Abnormal substances that might be found in the airways include
blood, secretions, or mucous plugs. Any abnormalities
are discussed with the patient.

Diagnosis
Brucellosis is usually diagnosed by detecting one
or more Brucella species in blood or urine samples.
The bacteria may be positively identified using biochemical methods or using a technique whereby, if
present in the sample, the brucellosis bacteria are
made to fluoresce. Brucellosis may also be diagnosed
by culturing and isolating the bacteria from one of the
above samples. Blood samples will also indicate elevated antibody levels or increased amounts of a protein produced directly in response to infection with
brucellosis bacteria.

Treatment
Prolonged treatment with antibiotics, including
tetracyclines (with streptomycin), co-trimoxazole,
and sulfonamides, is effective. Bed rest is also imperative. In the chronic form of brucellosis, the symptoms
may recur, requiring a second course of treatment.

Prognosis
Early diagnosis and prompt treatment is essential
to prevent chronic infection. Untreated, the disease
may linger for years, but it is rarely fatal. Relapses
may also occur.

Prevention
There is no human vaccine for brucellosis, but
humans can be protected by controlling the disease in
livestock. After checking to make sure an animal is not
already infected, and destroying those that are, all livestock should be immunized. Butchers and those who
work in slaughterhouses should wear protective glasses
and clothing, and protect broken skin from infection.
Some experts suggest that a person with the disease
refrain from engaging in unprotected sex until free of
the disease. The sexual partners of an infected person
should also be closely monitored for signs of infection.

I Bruises
Definition
Bruises, or ecchymoses, are a discoloration and
tenderness of the skin or mucous membranes due
to the leakage of blood from an injured blood vessel
into the tissues. Pupura refers to bruising as the result of
a disease condition. A very small bruise is called
a petechia. These often appear as many tiny red dots
clustered together, and could indicate a serious problem.

Description
Bruises change colors over time in a predictable
pattern, so that it is possible to estimate when an injury
occurred by the color of the bruise. Initially, a bruise
will be reddish, the color of the blood under the skin.
After one to two days, the red blood cells begin to break
down, and the bruise will darken to a blue or purplish
color. This fades to green at about day six. Around the
eighth or ninth day, the skin over the bruised area
will have a brown or yellowish appearance, and it will
gradually diminish back to its normal color.
Long periods of standing will cause the blood that
collects in a bruise to seep through the tissues. Bruises
are actually made of little pools of blood, so the blood
in one place may flow downhill after awhile and
appear in another. For instance, bruising in the back
of the abdomen may eventually appear in the groin;
bruising in the thigh or the knee will work its way
down to the ankle.

Causes and symptoms
Healthy people may develop bruises from any
injury that doesn’t break through the skin. Vigorous
exercise may also cause bruises due to bringing about
small tears in blood vessels walls. In a condition
known as purpura simplex, there is a tendency to
bruise easily due to an increased fragility of the
blood vessels. Bruises also develop easily in the elderly,
because the skin and blood vessels have a tendency to
become thinner and more fragile with aging, and there
is an increased use of medications that interfere with
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment
A bruise by itself needs no medical treatment. It is
often recommended that ice packs be applied on and off
during the first 24 hours of injury to reduce the bruising.
After that, heat, especially moist heat, is recommended
to increase the circulation and the healing of the injured
tissues. Rest, elevation of the effected part, and compression with a bandage will also retard the accumulation of blood. Rarely, if a bruise is so large that the body
cannot completely absorb it or if the site becomes
infected, it may have to be surgically removed.

the blood clotting system. In the condition known as
purpura senilis, the elderly develop bruises from minimal contact that may take up to several months to
completely heal.
The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories such
as ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) may lead to
increasedbruising. Aspirin, antidepressants, asthma medications, and cortisone medications also have this effect.
The anti-clotting medications also known as blood
thinners, especially the drug Warfarin (Coumadin),
may be the cause of particularly severe bruising.
Sometimes bruises are connected with more serious
illnesses. There are a number of diseases that cause
excessive bleeding or bleeding from injuries too slight
to have consequences in healthy people. An abnormal
tendency to bleed may be due to hereditary bleeding
disorders, certain prescription medications, diseases of
the blood such as leukemia, and diseases that increase
the fragility of blood vessels. If there are large areas of
bruising or bruises develop very easily, this may herald
a problem. Other causes that should be ruled out
include liver disease, alcoholism, drug addiction, and
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Bruising that occurs around the navel may indicate
dangerous internal bleeding; bruising behind the ear,
called Battle’s sign, may be due to a skull fracture; and
raised bruises may point to autoimmune disease.

Alternative treatment
Several types of topical applications are usually
recommend to speed healing and to reduce the pain
associated with bruises. Vitamin K cream can be
applied directly to the site of injury. Astringent herbs
such as witch hazel, Hamamelis virginiana, can be used.
This will tighten the tissues and therefore diminish the
bruising. The homeopathic remedy, Arnica montana,
can be applied as a cream or gel to unbroken skin.
Oral homeopathic remedies may reduce bruising,
pain, and swelling as well. Arnica montana, at 30 ml
(1 oz), taken one to two times per day is highly recommended. For ledum, 30 ml (1 oz) one to two times per
day is also useful.

Prognosis
The blood under the skin which causes the discoloration of bruising should be totally reabsorbed by
the body in three weeks or less. At that time, the skin
color should completely return to normal.
Sometimes, a bruise may become solid and
increase in size instead of dissolving. This may indicate blood trapped in the tissues, which may be need
to be drained. This is referred to as a hematoma.
Less commonly, the body may develop calcium
deposits at the injury site in a process called heterotopic ossification.

Bruising is usually a minor problem, which does
not require a medical diagnosis. However, faced with
extensive bruising, bruising with no apparent cause, or
bruising in certain locations, a physician will pursue an

Definition
Bruxism is the habit of clenching and grinding the
teeth. It most often occurs at night during sleep, but it
may also occur during the day. It is an unconscious
behavior, perhaps performed to release anxiety,
aggression, or anger.

Description
Bruxism is one of the oldest disorders known, and
approximately one in four adults experiences it. Most
people are not aware of it before their teeth have been
damaged.

Causes and symptoms
While bruxism is typically associated with stress, it
may also be triggered by abnormal occlusion (the way
the upper and lower teeth fit together), or crooked or
missing teeth.
Symptoms of bruxism include: dull headaches;
sore and tired facial muscles; earaches; sensitive
teeth; and locking, popping, and clicking of the jaw.
During a dental examination, a dentist may recognize damage resulting from bruxism, including:
enamel loss from the chewing surfaces of teeth; flattened tooth surfaces; loosened teeth; and fractured
teeth and fillings. Left untreated, bruxism may lead
to tooth loss and jaw dysfunction.
676

Diagnosis
Medical and dental histories and examinations
are necessary to differentiate bruxism from other conditions that may cause similar pain, such as ear infections, dental infections, and temporomandibular joint
(TMJ) dysfunction. However, uncommonly worndown teeth strongly suggest a diagnosis of bruxism.

Treatment
To prevent further damage to the teeth, bruxism is
treated by placing a removable, custom-fitted plastic
appliance called a night guard between the upper and
lower teeth. Although the clenching and grinding
behavior may continue, the teeth wear away the plastic
instead of each other.
In some cases, abnormal occlusion may be adjusted
and high spots removed so that the teeth fit together in
a more comfortable position. Missing teeth may be
replaced and crooked teeth may be straightened with
orthodontic treatment to eliminate possible underlying
causes of bruxism. In cases where jaw muscles are very
tight, a dentist may prescribe muscle relaxants.

Stress management and behavior modification

The major symptoms include pain in the upper
right-hand portion of the abdomen and a build-up of
fluid in the abdomen. In the United States, blood
disorders are the most common causes. Among these
disorders are polycythemia vera (an increase in the
number of red blood cells), and sickle cell anemia. In

I Budd-Chiari syndrome
Definition
Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare problem that
results from blood clotting in the veins flowing out of
the liver (hepatic veins). The high pressure of blood in
these veins leads to an enlarged liver, and to an accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, called ascites.

Description
The liver, the largest internal organ in the human
body, is responsible for many vital physiologic processes. Blood flow through the liver nourishes the
liver, carries in substances that the liver will process,
and carries away substances that the liver has produced. When blood cannot flow out freely from the
liver, blood pressure rises in the veins of the liver,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Other causes sometimes include:

certain infections



use of oral contraceptives



body changes in pregnancy and the postpartum period



phlebitis (inflammation of a vein)



injury to the abdomen



membranous webs (especially in Asia)

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome can be made
by an internist (a specialist in diseases of the internal
organs), a gastroenterologist (a specialist in the diseases of the digestive system), or a general surgeon. On
physical examination, the doctor will note that the liver
is larger than normal. Often an ultrasound scan of the
liver will show abnormalities in the size of the liver, an
abnormal pattern of the veins in the liver, and other
abnormalities. A CT scan will often show similar
abnormalities.

Budd-Chiari syndrome

clenching and teeth grinding. Tight jaw muscles may
be relaxed by applying warm compresses to the sides
of the face. Herbal muscle relaxants also can be helpful. Massage therapy and deep tissue realignment,
including rolfing, can assist in releasing the clenching
pattern. This is a more permanent alternative treatment for bruxism.

Buerger’s disease

Once these abnormalities are confirmed, the key
test is called hepatic vein catheterization. In this test, a
narrow tube is snaked through the body until it
reaches the hepatic veins. An instrument at the tip of
the catheter can measure the pressure within each
segment of the hepatic vein.
In some cases, a tiny amount of radioactive material is injected into a patient, and then an abnormal
pattern of radioactivity in the liver can be revealed.
In other cases, a liver biopsy enables a physician to
examine cells from the liver itself. Cells damaged by
Budd-Chiari syndrome have a characteristic appearance easily identifiable to a physician.

Treatment
Surgery
Most patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome must
have surgery. A surgeon will re-route blood flow
around the clotted hepatic vein into a large vein called
the vena cava. The exact technique will depend on the
specific location of the clots and other factors. In certain
patients, other surgical techniques may be used. For
patients who otherwise would have less than six months
to live, liver transplantation is sometimes performed.
In a few patients, a ‘‘balloon catheter’’ can open
the blocked blood vessels, without the need for major
surgery.
Drugs
Sometimes, anti-clotting drugs such as urokinase
can be used for patients with a sudden onset of clotting
in the veins of the liver. These drugs do not seem to
work when the clots have become established.

Prognosis
If surgery is done before permanent liver damage
sets in, long-term survival is possible. In these cases,
damaged liver cells can actually recover. If patients are
already very sick with liver disease, the surgery may
not be as helpful.

Prevention
The best approach to prevention is to carefully
control the blood disorders that can lead to BuddChiari syndrome.

(ages 20-40) who are heavy smokers of cigarettes.
Cases of this disease in non-smokers are very rare,
hence, cigarette smoking is considered a causative factor. Approximately 40% of the patients have a history
of inflammation of a vein (phlebitis), which may play a
role in the development of Buerger’s disease. The disease is mainly seen in the legs of affected persons, but
may also appear in their arms. Early symptoms
include decrease in the blood supply (arterial ischemia)
and superficial (near the skin surface) phlebitis. The
main symptom is pain in the affected areas. Onset of
the disease is gradual and first occurs in the feet or
hands. Inflammation occurs in small and mediumsized arteries and veins near the surface of the limb.
In advanced cases, blood vessels in other parts of the
body may be affected. There is a progressive decrease
in the blood flow to the affected areas. The pulse in
arteries of the feet is weak or undetectable. The lack of
blood flow can lead to gangrene, which is decay of
tissue due to restricted blood supply. A cold sensitivity
in the hands, similar to that seen in Raynaud’s disease,
can develop. In this case, the hands turn color–white,
blue, and then red–when exposed to the cold.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is usually made from the clinical symptoms. Patients frequently complain of numbness, tingling, or burning sensations in the affected area before
evidence of vascular inflammation becomes apparent.

KEY TERMS

Gangrene—A decay of the tissue in a part of the
body that experiences restricted blood flow.
Inflammation—A local reaction to irritation,
injury, or infection characterized by pain, swelling,
redness, and occasional loss of function.

Binge—To consume large amounts of food uncontrollably within a short time period.
Diuretic—A drug that promotes the formation and
excretion of urine.

Ischemia—A decrease in the blood supply to an
area of the body caused by obstruction or constriction of blood vessels.
Phlebitis—Inflammation of a vein.

Treatment
There is no effective medication or surgery for this
disease. Patients must stop smoking to halt further
development of the symptoms. Vasodilators, drugs
that increase the diameter of the blood vessels, can
be administered, but may not be effective. Exposure
of affected areas to heat or cold should be avoided.
Trauma to the feet and other affected areas should be
avoided and infections must be treated promptly.

Prognosis
The disease is progressive in patients who do not
stop smoking. Areas with gangrene must be removed
surgically.

Neurotransmitters—Certain brain chemicals that
may function abnormally in acutely ill bulimic
patients.

by the tendency to perform repetitive acts or rituals
in order to relieve anxiety.
Purge—To rid the body of food and calories, commonly by vomiting or using laxatives.

women. People with bulimia, known as bulimics,
consume large amounts of food (binge) and then try
to rid themselves of the food and calories (purge) by
fasting, excessive exercise, vomiting, or using laxatives.
The behavior often serves to reduce stress and relieve
anxiety. Because bulimia results from an excessive
concern with weight control and self-image, and is
often accompanied by depression, it is also considered
a psychiatric illness.

Description
Prevention
Smoking is the only known causative agent for
this disease and should be avoided.

I Bulimia nervosa
Definition
Bulimia nervosa is a serious and sometimes lifethreatening eating disorder affecting mainly young
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Bulimia nervosa is a serious health problem for
over two million adolescent girls and young women in
the United States. The bingeing and purging activity
associated with this disorder can cause severe damage,
even death, although the risk of death is not as high as
for anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder that leads to
excessive weight loss.
Binge eating may in rare instances cause the stomach to rupture. In the case of purging, heart failure
can result due to loss of vital minerals such as potassium. Vomiting causes other serious problems, including acid-related scarring of the fingers (if used to induce
vomiting) and damage to tooth enamel. In addition, the
tube that brings food from the mouth to the stomach
(the esophagus) often becomes inflamed and salivary
glands can become swollen. Irregular menstrual periods
can also result, and interest in sex may diminish.
Most bulimics find it difficult to stop their behavior
without professional help. Many typically recognize
that the behavior is not normal, but feel out of control.
Some bulimics struggle with other compulsive, risky

behaviors such as drug and alcohol abuse. Many also
suffer from other psychiatric illnesses, including clinical depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Most bulimics are females in their teens or early
20s. Males account for only 5-10% of all cases. People
of all races develop the disorder, but most of those
diagnosed are white.
Bulimic behavior is often carried out in secrecy,
accompanied by feelings of guilt or shame. Outwardly,
many people with bulimia appear healthy and successful, while inside they have feelings of helplessness and
low self-esteem.

Symptoms

Causes and symptoms

According to the American Anorexia/Bulimia
Association, Inc., warning signs of bulimia include:

Causes



eating large amounts of food uncontrollably (bingeing)



vomiting, abusing laxatives or diuretics, or engaging
in fasting, dieting, or vigorous exercise (purging)



preoccupation with body weight



using the bathroom frequently after meals

The cause of bulimia is unknown. Researchers
believe that it may be caused by a combination of
genetic and environmental factors. Bulimia tends to
run in families. Research shows that certain brain
chemicals, known as neurotransmitters, may function
680

abnormally in acutely ill bulimia patients. Scientists
also believe there may be a link between bulimia and
other psychiatric problems, such as depression and
OCD. Environmental influences include participation in work or sports that emphasize thinness, such
as modeling, dancing, or gymnastics. Family pressures also may play a role. One study found that
mothers who are extremely concerned about their
daughters’ physical attractiveness and weight may
help to cause bulimia. In addition, girls with eating
disorders tend to have fathers and brothers who criticize their weight.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

depression or mood swings



irregular menstrual periods



onset of dental problems, swollen cheeks or glands,
heartburn or bloating

Diagnosis
Bulimia is treated most successfully when diagnosed early. But because the bulimic may deny there
is a problem, getting medical help is often delayed. A
complete physical examination in order to rule out
other illnesses is the first step to diagnosis.
According to the American Psychiatric Association, a diagnosis of bulimia requires that a person
have all of the following symptoms:

eating disorder clinics in local hospitals or treatment
programs in colleges designed for students.

Alternative treatment
Light therapy–exposure to bright, artificial light–
may be useful in reducing bulimic episodes, especially
during the dark winter months. Some feel that massage may prove helpful, putting people in touch with
the reality of their own bodies and correcting misconceptions of body image. Hypnotherapy may help
resolve unconscious issues that contribute to bulimic
behavior.

Prognosis



recurrent episodes of binge eating (minimum average
of two binge-eating episodes a week for at least three
months)

Bulimia may become chronic and lead to serious
health problems, including seizures, irregular heartbeat, and thin bones. In rare cases, it may be fatal.



a feeling of lack of control over eating during the
binges



regular use of one or more of the following to prevent
weight gain: self-induced vomiting, use of laxatives
or diuretics, strict dieting or fasting, or vigorous
exercise

Timely therapy and medication can effectively
manage the disorder and help the bulimic look forward to a normal, productive, and fulfilling life.



persistent over-concern with body shape and weight

Prevention
There is no known method to prevent bulimia.
Resources

Treatment
Early treatment is important otherwise bulimia
may become chronic, with serious health consequences. A comprehensive treatment plan is called
for in order to address the complex interaction of
physical and psychological problems in bulimia. A
combination of drug and behavioral therapies is commonly used.
Behavioral approaches include individual psychotherapy, group therapy, and family therapy.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy, which teaches patients
how to change abnormal thoughts and behavior, is
also used. Nutrition counseling and self-help groups
are often helpful.
Antidepressants commonly used to treat bulimia
include desipramine (Norpramin), imipramine
(Tofranil), and fluoxetine (Prozac). These medications
also may treat any co-existing depression.
In addition to professional treatment, family support plays an important role in helping the bulimic
person. Encouragement and caring can provide the
support needed to convince the sick person to get
help, stay with treatment, or try again after a failure.
Family members can help locate resources, such as

I Bundle branch block
Definition
Bundle branch block (BBB) is a disruption in the
normal flow of electrical pulses that drive the heart
beat.

Description
Bundle branch block belongs to a group of heart
problems called intraventricular conduction defects
(IVCD). There are two bundle branches, right and
left. The right bundle carries nerve impulses that
cause contraction of the right ventricle (the lower
chamber of the heart) and the left bundle carries
nerve impulses that cause contraction of the left ventricle. The two bundles initially are together at a junction called the bundle of His. Nerve impulses come
through the sinus node of the heart to the bundle of
His and then move into the right and left bundle
branches. Bundle branch block is a slowing or interruption of nerve impulses. A problem may exist in any
of the three bundles.
Patients with BBB are generally without symptoms unless the disease is severe enough to cause a
complete infranodal A-V block and very slow heart
rate. In patients with right bundle branch block
(RBBB), the nerve impulse is conducted slowly or not
at all. The right ventricle finally receives the impulse
through muscle-to-muscle spread, outside the regular
nerve pathway. This mechanism of impulse transmission is slow and results in a delayed contraction of the
right ventricle. There are several types of left bundle
branch block (LBBB), each producing its own characteristic mechanism of failure. In each case, the nerve
impulse is blocked or delayed. Patients with LBBB
may have left ventricular disease or cardiomyopathy.

Causes and symptoms
Left bundle branch block usually happens as a
consequence of other diseases such as arteriosclerosis,
rheumatic fever, congenital heart disease, myocarditis,
myocardial infarction, metastatic heart tumors, or
other invasions of the heart tissue. Right bundle branch
block happens less often from underlying heart disease.

Diagnosis
Detection of BBB usually takes place during a
normal physical examination. The block shows up as
a widening of the second heart sound. Confirmation

of BBB is obtained by electrocardiogram (ECG).
The pattern seen in the electrocardiogram indicates
pulses in a heart beat and their duration. A QRS
duration of greater than 110 milliseconds is a diagnostic indication of BBB. There is a unique ECG pattern
for blocks in each of the three bundles.

Treatment
There is no specific therapy for BBB. Patients are
usually treated for associated heart diseases.

Prognosis
The prognosis of blockage in any of the three
bundle branches depends on the prognosis of the associated heart disease. The associated diseases determine
the outcome of the patient’s health. Occasionally,
disruptions in bundle branches lead to complete infranodal A-V block, a more serious blockage of nerve
impulses. Approximately 2% of patients with BBB
develop infranodal A-V blockage and these patients
often require artificial pacemakers.

by inflammation and usually results from chronic irritation and pressure from poorly fitting footwear.

Description
A displacement of two major bones of the foot
(hallux valgus) causes bunions, although not everyone
with this displacement will develop the joint swelling
and bone overgrowth that characterize a bunion. One
of the bones involved is called the first metatarsal
bone. This bone is long and slender, with the big toe
attached on one end and the other end connected to
foot bones closer to the ankle. This foot bone is displaced in the direction of the four other metatarsals
connected with the toes. The other bone involved is the
big toe itself, which is displaced toward the smaller
toes. As the big toe continues to move toward the
smaller toes, it may become displaced under or over
the second toe. The displacement of these two foot
bones causes a projection of bone on the inside portion
of the forefoot. The skin over this projection often
becomes inflamed from rubbing against the shoe,
and a callus may form.
The joint contains a small sac (bursa) filled with
fluid that cushions the bones and helps the joint to
move smoothly. When a bunion forms, this sac
becomes inflamed and thickened. The swelling in the
joint causes additional pain and pressure in the toe.

Causes and symptoms
Bunions may form as a result of abnormal motion
of the foot during walking or running. One common
example of an abnormal movement is an excessive
amount of stress placed upon the inside of the foot.
This leads to friction and irritation of the involved
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

structures. Age has also been noted as a factor in
developing bunions, in part because the underlying
bone displacement worsens over time unless corrective
measures are taken.
Wearing improperly fitting shoes, especially those
with a narrow toe box and excessive heel height, often
causes the formation of a bunion. This forefoot deformity is seen more often in women than men. The
higher frequency in females may be related to the
strong link between footwear fashion and bunions.
In fact, in a recent survey of more than 350 women,
nearly 90% wore shoes that were at least one size too
small or too narrow.
Because genetic factors can predispose people to
the hallux valgus bone displacement, a strong family
history of bunions can increase the likelihood of developing this foot disorder. Various arthritic conditions
and several genetic and neuromuscular diseases, such
as Down syndrome and Marfan syndrome, cause
muscle imbalances that can create bunions from
displacement of the first metatarsal and big toe.
Other possible causes of bunions are leg-length discrepancies, with the bunion present on the longer leg, and
trauma occurring to the joint of the big toe.
Symptoms of bunions include the common signs
of inflammation such as redness, swelling, and pain.
The discomfort is primarily located along the inside of
the foot just behind the big toe. Because of friction, a
callus may develop over the bunion. If an overlapping
of the toes is allowed, additional rubbing and pain
occurs. Inflammation of this area causes a decrease
in motion with associated discomfort in the joint
between the big toe and the first metatarsal. If allowed
to worsen, the skin over the bunion may break down
causing an ulcer, which also presents a problem of
potential infection. (Foot ulcers can be particularly
dangerous for people with diabetes, who may have
trouble feeling the ulcer forming and healing if it
becomes infected.)
683

Bunion

Diagnosis
A thorough medical history and physical exam
by a physician is always necessary for the proper diagnosis of bunions and other foot conditions. X rays
can help confirm the diagnosis by showing the bone
displacement, joint swelling, and, in some cases, the
overgrowth of bone that characterizes bunions.
Doctors will also consider the possibility that the
joint pain is caused by or complicated by arthritis
(which causes destruction of the cartilage of the
joint), gout (which causes the accumulation of uric
acid crystals in the joint), tiny fractures of a bone in
the foot (stress fractures), or infection and may order
additional tests to rule out these possibilities.

Treatment
Conservative
The first step in treating a bunion is to remove
as much pressure from the area as possible. People
with bunions should wear shoes that have enough
room in the toe box to accommodate the bunion
and avoid high-heeled shoes and tight-fitting socks
or stockings. Dressings and pads help protect the
bunion from additional shoe pressure. The application of splints or customized shoe inserts (orthotics)
to correct the alignment of the big toe joint is effective
for many bunions. Most patients are instructed to
rest or choose exercises that put less stress on their
feet, at least until the misalignment is corrected.
In some cases, physicians also use steroid injections
with local anesthetic around the bunion to reduce
inflammation.
Surgery
If conservative treatment is not successful, surgical removal of the bunion may be necessary to correct
the deformity. This procedure is called a bunionectomy, and there are many variations on the operation,
which is usually performed by a surgeon who specializes in treating bone conditions (orthopedics) or by
one who specializes in treating the foot (podiatry).
Surgeons consider the angle of the bone misalignment,
the condition of the bursa, and the strength of the
bones when they choose which procedure to use.
Most bunionectomies involve the removal of a section
of bone and the insertion of pins to rejoin the bone.
Sometimes the surgeons may move ligaments (which
connect bone to bone in the joint) or tendons (which
connect bone to muscle) in order to realign the bones.
After this procedure, the bones and other tissues are
held in place while they heal by compression dressings
684

or a short cast. The individual must refrain from vigorous exercise for six weeks.

Alternative treatment
Deep friction massage techniques by a physical or
massage therapist can be helpful to increase circulation, reduce inflammation, and prevent soft tissue
build up. Physical therapy also provides useful
approaches such as ultrasound to help retard or
reverse the formation of the bunion. Various taping
techniques can be useful to realign the toe and decrease
friction and rubbing that may be present. The homeopathic tissue salt Calcarea phosphorica can be useful
in balancing the bone formation/remodeling.

Prognosis
Often modifications in footwear allow a good
prognosis without surgery. If surgery is necessary,
complete healing without complications requires
approximately four to six weeks. Even after surgery
corrects the bone misalignment, patients are usually
instructed to continue wearing low-heeled, roomy
shoes to prevent the bunion from reforming.

Prevention
Prevention begins with proper foot wear. Shoes
with a wide and deep toe box are best. High-heeled
shoes should not be worn for long periods of time. If a
bunion is present and becomes inflamed, the foot
should be elevated with the application of an ice
pack over the painful area for not more than 20
minutes every other hour. If pain and swelling continue, a podiatrist or physician should be contacted.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Definition
Burns are injuries to tissues caused by heat, friction, electricity, radiation, or chemicals.

Description
Burns are characterized by degree, based on the
severity of the tissue damage. A first-degree burn
causes redness and swelling in the outermost layers
of skin (epidermis). A second-degree burn involves
redness, swelling and blistering, and the damage may
extend beneath the epidermis to deeper layers of skin
(dermis). A third-degree burn, also called a full-thickness burn, destroys the entire depth of skin, causing
significant scarring. Damage also may extend to the
underlying fat, muscle, or bone.
The severity of the burn is also judged by the
amount of body surface area (BSA) involved. Health
care workers use the ‘‘rule of nines’’ to determine the
percentage of BSA affected in patients more than
9 years old: each arm with its hand is 9% of BSA;
each leg with its foot is 18%; the front of the torso is
18%; the back of the torso, including the buttocks, is
18%; the head and neck are 9%; and the genital area
(perineum) is 1%. This rule cannot be applied to a
young child’s body proportions, so BSA is estimated
using the palm of the patient’s hand as a measure of
1% area.
The severity of the burn will determine not only
the type of treatment, but also where the burn patient
should receive treatment. Minor burns may be treated
at home or in a doctor’s office. These are defined as
first- or second-degree burns covering less than 15%
of an adult’s body or less than 10% of a child’s body,
or a third-degree burn on less than 2% BSA. Moderate
burns should be treated at a hospital. These are
defined as first- or second-degree burns covering
15%-25% of an adult’s body or 10%-20% of a child’s
body, or a third-degree burn on 2%-10% BSA.
Critical, or major, burns are the most serious and
should be treated in a specialized burn unit of a hospital. These are defined as first- or second-degree burns
covering more than 25% of an adult’s body or more
than 20% of a child’s body, or a third-degree burn on
more than 10% BSA. In addition, burns involving
the hands, feet, face, eyes, ears, or genitals are considered critical. Other factors influence the level of treatment needed, including associated injuries such as
bone fractures and smoke inhalation, presence of a
chronic disease, or a history of being abused. Also,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Causes and symptoms
Burns may be caused by even a brief encounter
with heat greater than 120  F (49  C). The source of
this heat may be the sun (causing a sunburn), hot
liquids, steam, fire, electricity, friction (causing rug
burns and rope burns), and chemicals (causing a caustic burn upon contact).
Signs of a burn are localized redness, swelling, and
pain. A severe burn will also blister. The skin may also
peel, appear white or charred, and feel numb. A burn
may trigger a headache and fever. Extensive burns
may induce shock, the symptoms of which are faintness, weakness, rapid pulse and breathing, pale and
clammy skin, and bluish lips and fingernails.

Diagnosis
A physician will diagnose a burn based upon visual
examination, and will also ask the patient or family
members questions to determine the best treatment. He
or she may also check for smoke inhalation, carbon monoxide poisoning, cyanide poisoning, other event-related
trauma, or, if suspected, further evidence of child abuse.

Treatment
Burn treatment consists of relieving pain, preventing infection, and maintaining body fluids, electrolytes, and calorie intake while the body heals.
Treatment of chemical or electrical burns is slightly
different from the treatment of thermal burns but the
objectives are the same.
Thermal burn treatment
The first act of thermal burn treatment is to stop
the burning process. This may be accomplished by
letting cool water run over the burned area or by
soaking it in cool (not cold) water. Ice should never
be applied to the burn. Cool (not cold) wet compresses
may provide some pain relief when applied to small
areas of first- and second-degree burns. Butter, shortening, or similar salve should never be applied to the
burn since it prevents heat from escaping and drives
the burning process deeper into the skin.
If the burn is minor, it may be cleaned gently with
soap and water. Blisters should not be broken. If the
skin of the burned area is unbroken and it is not likely to
be further irritated by pressure or friction, the burn

should be left exposed to the air to promote healing. If
the skin is broken or apt to be disturbed, the burned area
should be coated lightly with an antibacterial ointment
and covered with a sterile bandage. Aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol), or ibuprofen (Advil) may be taken to
ease pain and relieve inflammation. A doctor should be
consulted if these signs of infection appear: increased
warmth, redness, pain, or swelling; pus or similar
drainage from the wound; swollen lymph nodes; or
red streaks spreading away from the burn.
686

In situations where a person has received moderate or critical burns, lifesaving measures take precedence over burn treatment and emergency medical
assistance must be called. A person with serious
burns may stop breathing, and artificial respiration
(also called mouth-to-mouth resuscitation or rescue
breathing) should be administered immediately.
Also, a person with burns covering more than 12%
BSA is likely to go into shock; this condition may be
prevented by laying the person flat and elevating
the feet about 12 in (30 cm). Burned arms and
hands should also be raised higher than the person’s
heart.
In rescues, a blanket may be used to smother any
flames as the person is removed from danger. The
person whose clothing is on fire should ‘‘stop, drop,
and roll’’ or be assisted in lying flat on the ground and
rolling to put out the fire. Afterwards, only burnt clothing that comes off easily should be removed; any clothing embedded in the burn should not be disturbed.
Removing any smoldering apparel and covering the
person with a light, cool, wet cloth, such as a sheet but
not a blanket or towel, will stop the burning process.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Debridement—The surgical removal of dead tissue.
Dermis—The basal layer of skin; it contains blood
and lymphatic vessels, nerves, glands, and hair
follicles.
Epidermis—The outer portion of skin, made up of
four or five superficial layers.
Shock—An abnormal condition resulting from low
blood volume due to hemorrhage or dehydration.
Signs of shock include rapid pulse and breathing,
and cool, moist, pale skin.

At the hospital, the staff will provide further
medical treatment. A tube to aid breathing may be
inserted if the patient’s airways or lungs have been
damaged, as can happen during an explosion or a fire
in a enclosed space. Also, because burns dramatically
deplete the body of fluids, replacement fluids are
administered intravenously. The patient is also
given antibiotics intravenously to prevent infection,
and he or she may also receive a tetanus shot, depending on his or her immunization history. Once the
burned area is cleaned and treated with antibiotic
cream or ointment, it is covered in sterile bandages,
which are changed two to three times a day. Surgical
removal of dead tissue (debridement) also takes place.
As the burns heal, thick, taut scabs (eschar) form,
which the doctor may have to cut to improve blood
flow to the more elastic healthy tissue beneath. The
patient will also undergo physical and occupational
therapy to keep the burned areas from becoming
inflexible and to minimize scarring.
In cases where the skin has been so damaged that
it cannot properly heal, a skin graft is usually performed. A skin graft involves taking a piece of skin
from an unburned portion of the patient’s body
(autograft) and transplanting it to the burned area.
When doctors cannot immediately use the patient’s
own skin, a temporary graft is performed using the
skin of a human donor (allograft), either alive or
dead, or the skin of an animal (xenograft), usually
that of a pig.
The burn victim also may be placed in a hyperbaric chamber, if one is available. In a hyperbaric chamber (which can be a specialized room or enclosed
space), the patient is exposed to pure oxygen under
high pressure, which can aid in healing. However, for
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

this therapy to be effective, the patient must be placed
in a chamber within 24 hours of being burned.
Chemical burn treatment
Burns from liquid chemicals must be rinsed with
cool water for at least 15 minutes to stop the burning
process. Any burn to the eye must be similarly flushed
with water. In cases of burns from dry chemicals such
as lime, the powder should be completely brushed
away before the area is washed. Any clothing which
may have absorbed the chemical should be removed.
The burn should then be loosely covered with a sterile
gauze pad and the person taken to the hospital for
further treatment. A physician may be able to neutralize the offending chemical with another before
treating the burn like a thermal burn of similar
severity.
Electrical burn treatment
Before electrical burns are treated at the site of the
accident, the power source must be disconnected if
possible and the victim moved away from it to keep
the person giving aid from being electrocuted.
Lifesaving measures again take priority over burn
treatment, so breathing must be checked and assisted
if necessary. Electrical burns should be loosely covered
with sterile gauze pads and the person taken to the
hospital for further treatment.

Alternative treatment
In addition to the excellent treatment of burns
provided by traditional medicine, some alternative
approaches may be helpful as well. (Major burns should
always be treated by a medical practitioner.) The
homeopathic remedies Cantharis and Causticum can
assist in burn healing. A number of botanical remedies,
applied topically, can also help burns heal. These
include aloe (Aloe barbadensis), oil of St.-John’s-wort
(Hypericum perforatum), calendula (Calendula officinalis), comfrey (Symphytum officinale), and tea tree oil
(Melaleuca spp.). Supplementing the diet with vitamin
C, vitamin E, and zinc also is beneficial for wound
healing.

Prognosis
The prognosis is dependent upon the degree of the
burn, the amount of body surface covered, whether
critical body parts were affected, any additional injuries or complications like infection, and the promptness of medical treatment. Minor burns may heal in
five to 10 days with no scarring. Moderate burns may
687

Burns

Bursitis

heal in 10-14 days and may leave scarring. Critical
or major burns take more than 14 days to heal and
will leave significant scarring. Scar tissue may limit
mobility and functionality, but physical therapy may
overcome these limitations. In some cases, additional
surgery may be advisable to remove scar tissue and
restore appearance.

Prevention
Burns are commonly received in residential fires.
Properly placed and working smoke detectors in combination with rapid evacuation plans will minimize a person’s exposure to smoke and flames in the event of a fire.
Children must be taught never to play with matches,
lighters, fireworks, gasoline, and cleaning fluids.
Burns by scalding with hot water or other liquids
may be prevented by setting the water heater thermostat no higher than 120  F (49  C), checking the temperature of bath water before getting into the tub, and
turning pot handles on the stove out of the reach of
children. Care should be used when removing covers
from pans of steaming foods and when uncovering or
opening foods heated in a microwave oven.
Thermal burns are often received from electrical
appliances. Care should be exercised around stoves,
space heaters, irons, and curling irons.
Sunburns may be avoided by the liberal use of a
sunscreen containing either an opaque active ingredient
such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide or a nonopaque
active ingredient such as PABA (para-aminobenzoic
acid) or benzophenone. Hats, loose clothing, and
umbrellas also provide protection, especially between
10 A.M. and 3 P.M. when the most damaging ultraviolet rays are present in direct sunlight.
Electrical burns may be prevented by covering
unused electrical outlets with safety plugs and keeping
electrical cords away from infants and toddlers who
might chew on them. Persons should also seek shelter
indoors during a thunderstorm to avoid being struck
by lightning.
Chemical burns may be prevented by wearing
protective clothing, including gloves and eyeshields.
Chemical agents should always be used according to
the manufacturer’s instructions and properly stored
when not in use.

I Bursitis
Definition
Bursitis is the painful inflammation of the bursa,
a padlike sac found in areas subject to friction.
Bursae cushion the movement between the bones,
tendons and muscles near the joints. Bursitis is most
often caused by repetitive movement and is known by
several common names including weaver’s bottom,
clergyman’s knee, and miner’s elbow, depending on
the affected individual’s occupation and area of
injury.

Description
There are over 150 bursae in the human body.
Usually bursae are present from birth, but they may
form in response to repeated pressure. Each sac contains a small amount of synovial fluid, a clear liquid
that acts as a lubricant. Inflammation causes pain on
movement. The most common site for bursitis to occur
is the shoulder (subdeltoid), but it also is seen in the
elbows (olecranon), hips (trochanteric), knees, heels
(Achilles), and toes. The affected area may be referred
to as ‘‘frozen,’’ because movement is so limited. In the
knee there are four bursae, and all can become
inflamed with overuse.

Causes and symptoms
The most common cause of bursitis is repeated
physical activity, but it can flare up for no known
reason. It can also be caused by trauma, rheumatoid
arthritis, gout, and acute or chronic infection.
Pain and tenderness are common symptoms. If
the affected joint is close to the skin, as with the
shoulder, knee, elbow, or Achilles tendon, swelling
and redness are seen and the area may feel warm to
the touch. The bursae around the hip joint are deeper,
and swelling is not obvious. Movement may be limited
and is painful. In the shoulder, it may be difficult to
raise the arm out from the side of the body. Putting on
a jacket or combing the hair becomes a troublesome
activity.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Arthritis—Inflammation of a joint that may lead to
changes in the joint’s structure. It causes pain and
swelling. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease
that leads to crippling deformities.
Diabetes mellitus—A metabolic disease caused by
a deficiency of insulin, which is essential to process
carbohydrates in the body.
Gout—A hereditary metabolic disease that is a
form of arthritis and causes inflammation of the
joints. It is more common in men.
Inflammation—The reaction of tissue to injury.
Kinesiology—The science or study of movement.

In acute bursitis symptoms appear suddenly; with
chronic bursitis, pain, tenderness, and limited movement reappear after exercise or strain.

Diagnosis
When a patient has pain in a joint, a careful physical examination is needed to determine what type of
movement is affected and if there is any swelling present. Bursitis will not show up on x-rays, although
sometimes there are also calcium deposits in the joint
that can be seen. Inserting a thin needle into the
affected bursa and removing (aspirating) some of the
synovial fluid for examination can confirm the diagnosis. In most cases, the fluid will not be clear. It can
be tested for the presence of microorganisms, which
would indicate an infection, and crystals, which could
indicate gout. In instances where the diagnosis is difficult, a local anesthetic (a drug that numbs the area) is
injected into the painful spot. If the discomfort stops
temporarily, then bursitis is probably the correct
diagnosis.

Treatment
Conservative treatment of bursitis is usually effective. The application of heat, rest, and immobilization
of the affected joint area is the first step. A sling can be
used for a shoulder injury; a cane is helpful for hip
problems. The patient can take nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, ibuprofin,
and naproxen. They can be obtained without a prescription and relieve the pain and inflammation. Once
the pain decreases, exercises of the affected area can

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

begin. If the nearby muscles have become weak
because of the disease or prolonged immobility, then
exercises to build strength and improve movement are
best. A doctor or physical therapist can prescribe an
effective regimen.
If the bursitis is related to an inflammatory condition like arthritis or gout, then management of that
disease is needed to control the bursitis.
When bursitis does not respond to conservative
treatment, an injection into the joint of a long-acting
corticosteroid preparation, like prednisone, can
bring immediate and lasting relief. A corticosteroid
is a hormonal substance that is the most effective
drug for reducing inflammation. The drug is mixed
with a local anesthetic and works on the joint within
five minutes. Usually one injection is all that is
needed.
Surgery to remove the damaged bursa may be
performed in extreme cases.
If the bursitis is caused by an infection, then
additional treatment is needed. Septic bursitis is
caused by the presence of a pus-forming organism,
usually staphylococcus aureus. This is confirmed by
examining a sample of the fluid in the bursa and
requires treatment with antibiotics taken by mouth,
injected into a muscle or into a vein (intravenously).
The bursa will also need to be drained by needle
two or three times over the first week of treatment.
When a patient has such a serious infection, there
may be underlying causes. There could be undiscovered diabetes, or an inefficient immune system
caused by human immunodeficiency virus infection
(HIV).

Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments take into consideration
the role of diet in causing bursitis. The faulty use of
calcium by the body, magnesium deficiency, and
food allergies may have a role. Diet changes and
vitamin supplements may be helpful. The use of
herbs, homeopathy, aromatherapy, and hydrotherapy can help relieve symptoms. Ginger is useful in
reducing inflammation. Acupuncture has been proven effective in treating hip and shoulder pain caused
by bursitis and other conditions. Other therapies
that deal effectively with musculoskeletal problems
(relating to the muscles and skeleton), may also be
helpful, such as body work, magnetic field therapy,
naturopathic medicine, chiropractic, and applied
kinesiology.

KEY TERMS

Byssinosis

Prognosis
Bursitis usually responds well to treatment, but it
may develop into a chronic condition if the underlying
cause is not corrected.

Prevention
Aggravating factors should be eliminated to prevent bursitis. Overexercising or the repetition of a
movement that triggers the condition should be
avoided. Doing exercises to strengthen the muscles
around the joint will also help. When doing repetitive
tasks, frequent breaks should be taken and the
activity should be alternated with others using different parts of the body. To cushion the joints, it is a
good idea to use cushioned chairs when sitting and
foam kneeling pads for the knees. Leaning on the
elbows, kneeling or sitting on a hard surface for a
long period of time should be avoided. Not wearing
high heels can help prevent bursitis in the heel, as can
changing to new running shoes as soon as the old
ones are worn out.

I Byssinosis
Definition
Byssinosis is a chronic, asthma-like narrowing of
the airways. Also called brown lung disease, byssinosis
results from inhaling particles of cotton, flax, hemp,
or jute.

Description
Although inhaling cotton dust was identified as a
source of respiratory disease more than 300 years
ago, byssinosis has been recognized as an occupational hazard for textile workers for less than 50
years. More than 800,000 workers in the cotton,
flax, and rope-making industries are exposed in the
workplace to airborne particles that can cause
690

KEY TERMS
Wheeze—A whistling sound made by the flow of
high-velocity air through narrowed airways.
Wheezing is a symptom of several respiratory diseases including byssinosis and asthma.

byssinosis. Only workers in mills that manufacture
yarn, thread, or fabric have a significant risk of dying
of this disease.
In the United States, byssinosis is almost completely limited to workers who handle unprocessed cotton. More than 35,000 textile workers have been
disabled by byssinosis and 183 died between 1979
and 1992. Most of the people whose deaths were due
to byssinosis lived in the textile-producing regions of
North and South Carolina.

Causes and symptoms
As many as 25% of workers with byssinosis have
symptoms that continue or recur throughout the
workweek. More severe breathing problems seem to
result both from exposure to high levels of dust and
from longer dust exposure. Workers who also smoke
cigarettes suffer the most severe impairment.

Diagnosis
Tests that detect decreasing lung capacity during
the workday are used to diagnose byssinosis.
Obstructive patterns are likely in patients who have
had recurrent symptoms for more than 10 years.

Treatment
Therapy for early-stage byssinosis focuses on
reversing airway narrowing. Antihistamines may be
prescribed to reduce tightness in the chest.
Bronchodilators (drugs used to relax breathing passages and improve air flow) may be used with an
inhaler or taken in tablet form. Reducing exposure is
essential. Any worker who has symptoms of byssinosis
or who has trouble breathing should transfer to a lesscontaminated area.

Prognosis
Smoking, impaired lung function, and a history of
respiratory allergy increase a textile worker’s risk of
developing byssinosis. Prolonged exposure makes

current United States standard for cotton dust
exposure.
Resources

Prevention
Eliminating exposure to textile dust is the surest
way to prevent byssinosis. Using exhaust hoods,
improving ventilation, and employing wetting procedures are very successful methods of controlling dust
levels to prevent byssinosis. Protective equipment
required during certain procedures also prevents
exposure to levels of contamination that exceed the

C
I C-reactive protein
Definition
C-reactive protein (CRP) is a protein produced by
the liver and found in the blood.

Purpose
C-reactive protein is not normally found in the
blood of healthy people. It appears after an injury,
infection, or inflammation and disappears when the
injury heals or the infection or inflammation goes
away. Research suggests that patients with prolonged
elevated levels of C-reactive protein are at an increased
risk for heart disease, stroke, hypertension (high blood
pressure), diabetes, and metabolic syndrome (insulin
resistance, a precursor of type 2 diabetes). The amount
of CRP produced by the body varies from person to
person, and this difference is affected by an individual’s genetic makeup (accounting for almost half of
the variation in CRP levels between different people)
and lifestyle. Higher CRP levels tend to be found in
individuals who smoke, have high blood pressure, are
overweight and do not exercise, whereas lean, athletic
individuals tend to have lower CRP levels.
The research shows that too much inflammation
can sometimes have adverse effects on the blood vessels
which transport oxygen and nutrients throughout the
body. Atherosclerosis, which involves the formation of
fatty deposits or plaques in the inner walls of the
arteries, is now considered in many ways an inflammatory disorder of the blood vessels, similar to the way
arthritis can be considered an inflammatory disorder of
the bones and joints. Inflammation affects the atherosclerotic phase of heart disease and can cause plaques to
rupture, which produces a clot and interfere with blood
flow, causing a heart attack or stroke.
There is an association between elevated levels of
inflammatory markers (including CRP) and the future
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

development of heart disease. This correlation applies
even to apparently healthy men and women who have
normal cholesterol levels. CRP level can be used by
physicians as part of the assessment of a patient’s risk
for heart disease because it is a stable molecule and can
be easily measured with a simple blood test. In patients
already suffering from heart disease, doctors can use
CRP levels to determine which patients are at high risk
for recurring coronary events.

Precautions
As of 2005, there are no precautions regarding the
C-reactive protein test. The person withdrawing blood
for the test should be notified if the patient is allergic to
latex or has a fear of needles.

Description
C-reactive protein was discovered in 1930, but few
people outside the medical community had heard of it
until stories about it began hitting the mainstream
media in early 2005. In 2005, two studies published
in the January 6, 2005, issue of The New England
Journal of Medicine provide the best evidence to date
that the C-reactive protein level in a person’s blood is
an important and highly accurate predictor of future
heart disease. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a sign of
inflammation in the walls of arteries. The studies
show that reducing the inflammation by lowering
CRP levels with a class of drugs known as statins
significantly lowers the rate of heart attacks and
coronary-artery disease in people with acute heart
disease. In fact, the studies indicated CRP levels may
be as important—if not more important—in predicting
and preventing heart disease as cholesterol levels are.
Persons with moderate or high levels of CRP can
often reduce the levels with lifestyle changes, including
quitting smoking, engaging in regular exercise, taking in
healthy nutrition, taking a multivitamin daily, replacing
saturated fats such as butter with monounsaturated
693

C-reactive protein

fats (particularly olive oil), increasing intake of
Omega-3 fatty acids, losing weight if overweight, and
increasing fiber intake. Drugs called statins (usually
used to reduce high levels of low density lipoproteins
(LDL), the so-called bad cholesterol, can also reduce
CRP levels. These drugs include: lovastatin (Mevacor),
simvastatin (Zocor), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and the two
drugs used in the 2005 CRP studies, pravastatin
(Pravacol) and atorvastatin (Lipitor). Other drugs that
lower CRP levels include the anti-cholesterol drug
ezetimibe (Zetia) and the diabetes medication rosiglitazone (Avandia).
Not all physicians are convinced the two studies
published in 2005 are accurate, noting that both
studies were funded by pharmaceutical companies
(Pfizer and Bristol-Meyer Squibb) that make statin
drugs used to reduce CRP levels. Also, the lead
authors of the studies have ‘‘strong financial ties to
the cardiac drug industry,’’ according to an article in
the February 2005 issue of HealthFacts. The article
also states that study participants already had severe
heart disease and in one study, 36% of the participants
smoked. It added that the CRP test is still unproven in
predicting future acute heart problems in people
with mild heart disease or healthy people at risk for
developing heart disease.
The C-reactive protein test costs $45 to $85, is
performed in physicians’ offices, labs, and hospitals.
Medicare usually covers the cost as do most other
insurance plans.

KEY TERMS
Atherosclerosis—A common artery disease in
which raised areas of degeneration and cholesterol deposits (plaques) form on the inner surfaces
of the arteries, often obstructing blood flow.
Hypertension—High blood pressure.
Low density lipoproteins (LDL)—A blood-plasma
lipoprotein that is high in cholesterol and low in
protein content and that carries cholesterol to cells
and tissue; also called bad cholesterol.
Omega-3 fatty acids—One of a group of beneficial fats found in oily fish, seeds, and whole grains.
Statins—A class of drugs commonly used to lower
LDL cholesterol levels.

Risks
There is an extremely slight risk of infection at the
needle puncture site.

Normal results
Normal test results are CRP levels of less than one
milligram (mg) per liter of blood. The ideal result is a
CRP level of zero.

Abnormal results
Preparation
No advance preparation for the CRP test is
needed on the part of the patient. The test is conducted
on a small sample of blood that usually takes about a
minute to withdraw from a patient’s vein. The CRP
test is performed in a laboratory and the results are
usually available in three to five days. A healthcare
professional, usually a nurse or laboratory technician,
will wrap and tighten a latex strap around the patient’s
upper arm. The site where blood will be drawn
(usually the bend in the arm above the elbow) will be
swabbed with alcohol. A small needle attached to a
collection vial will be inserted into a vein and a small
amount of blood will be withdrawn. When the vial is
full, the needle and strap will be removed and a cotton
ball will be taped over the injection site.

C-reactive protein levels of 1–3 mg per liter of
blood indicates a moderate risk of heart disease.
CRP levels above 3 mg per liter of blood indicates a
high risk for heart disease.

relievers, medicines for migraine headaches, and antihistamines also contain caffeine.

Recommended dosage
Adults and children age 12 years and over
100–200 mg no more than every 3–4 hours. In
timed-release form, the dose is 200–250 mg once a
day. Timed–release forms should not be taken less
than six hours before bedtime.
Children under 12 years
Not recommended.
Other considerations
People should avoid taking much caffeine when it
is being used as an over-the-counter drug and should
consider how much caffeine is being taken in from
coffee, tea, chocolate, soft drinks, and other foods
that contain caffeine. A pharmacist or physician
should be consulted to find out how much caffeine is
safe to use.

Precautions

I Caffeine
Definition
Caffeine is a drug that stimulates the central nervous system.

Purpose
Caffeine makes people more alert, less drowsy,
and improves coordination. Combined with certain
pain relievers or medicines for treating migraine headache, caffeine makes those drugs work more quickly
and effectively. Caffeine alone can also help relieve
headaches. Antihistamines are sometimes combined
with caffeine to counteract the drowsiness that those
drugs cause. Caffeine is also sometimes used to treat
other conditions, including breathing problems in
newborns and in young babies after surgery.

Description
Caffeine is found naturally in coffee, tea, and
chocolate. Colas and some other soft drinks contain
it. Caffeine also comes in tablet and capsule forms and
can be bought without a prescription. Over-the-counter caffeine brands include No Doz, Overtime, PepBack, Quick-Pep, Caffedrine, and Vivarin. Some pain
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Caffeine cannot replace sleep and should not be
used regularly to stay awake as the drug can lead to
more serious sleep disorders, such as insomnia.
People who use large amounts of caffeine over long
periods build up a tolerance to it. When this happens,
they have to use more and more caffeine to get the same
effects. Heavy caffeine use can also lead to dependence.
If the person then stops using caffeine abruptly,
withdrawal symptoms may occur. These can include
throbbing headaches, fatigue, drowsiness, yawning,
irritability, restlessness, vomiting, or runny nose. These
symptoms can go on for as long as a week if caffeine is
avoided. Then the symptoms usually disappear. As of
2004, caffeine withdrawal has been officially recognized
as a disorder classification manual.
If taken too close to bedtime, caffeine can interfere
with sleep. Even if it does not prevent a person from
falling asleep, it may disturb sleep during the night.
The notion that caffeine helps people sober up
after drinking too much alcohol is a myth. In fact,
using caffeine and alcohol together is not a good
idea. The combination can lead to an upset stomach,
nausea, and vomiting.
Older people may be more sensitive to caffeine and
thus more likely to have certain side effects, such as
irritability, nervousness, anxiety, and sleep problems.

Special conditions
Caffeine may cause problems for people with certain medical conditions or who are taking certain
medicines.
ALLERGIES. Anyone with allergies to foods, dyes,
preservatives, or to the compounds aminophylline,
dyphylline, oxtriphylline, theobromine, or theophylline should check with a physician before using caffeine. Anyone who has ever had an unusual reaction to
caffeine should also check with a physician before
using it again.
PREGNANCY. Caffeine can pass from a pregnant
woman’s body into the developing fetus. Although
there is no evidence that caffeine causes birth defects
in people, it does cause such effects in laboratory
animals given very large doses (equal to human doses
of 12–24 cups of coffee a day). In humans, evidence
exists that doses of more than 300 mg of caffeine a day
(about the amount of caffeine in 2–3 cups of coffee)
may cause miscarriage or problems with the baby’s
heart rhythm. Women who take more than 300 mg
of caffeine a day during pregnancy are also more likely
to have babies with low birth weights. Any woman
who is pregnant or planning to become pregnant
should check with her physician before using caffeine.
BREASTFEEDING. Caffeine passes into breast milk
and can affect the nursing baby. Nursing babies whose
mothers use 600 mg or more of caffeine a day may be
irritable and have trouble sleeping. Women who are
breastfeeding should check with their physicians
before using caffeine.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Caffeine may cause
problems for people with these medical conditions:


peptic ulcer



heart arrhythmias or palpitations



heart disease or recent heart attack (within a few
weeks)



high blood pressure



liver disease



insomnia (trouble sleeping)



anxiety or panic attacks



agoraphobia (fear of being in open places)



premenstrual syndrome (PMS)

USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Using caffeine with
certain other drugs may interfere with the effects of
the drugs or cause unwanted—and possibly serious—
side effects.

696

KEY TERMS
Arrhythmia—Abnormal heart rhythm.
Central nervous system—The brain and spinal cord.
Fetus—A developing baby inside the womb.
Palpitation—Rapid, forceful, throbbing, or fluttering
heartbeat.
Withdrawal symptoms—A group of physical or
mental symptoms that may occur when a person
suddenly stops using a drug to which he or she has
become dependent.

Side effects
At recommended doses, caffeine can cause restlessness, irritability, nervousness, shakiness, headache,
lightheadedness, sleeplessness, nausea, vomiting, and
upset stomach. At higher than recommended doses,
caffeine can cause excitement, agitation, anxiety,
confusion, a sensation of light flashing before the
eyes, unusual sensitivity to touch, unusual sensitivity
of other senses, ringing in the ears, frequent urination,
muscle twitches or tremors, heart arrhythmias, rapid
heartbeat, flushing, and convulsions. High caffeine
consumption can lead to benign breast disease, which
also can increase risk of breast cancer.

Interactions
Certain drugs interfere with the breakdown of
caffeine in the body. These include oral contraceptives
that contain estrogen, the antiarrhythmia drug mexiletine (Mexitil), the ulcer drug cimetidine (Tagamet),
and the drug disulfiram (Antabuse), used to treat
alcoholism.
Caffeine interferes with drugs that regulate heart
rhythm, such as quinidine and propranolol (Inderal).
Caffeine may also interfere with the body’s absorption
of iron. Anyone who takes iron supplements should
take them at least an hour before or two hours after
using caffeine.
Serious side effects are possible when caffeine is
combined with certain drugs. For example, taking caffeine with the decongestant phenylpropanolamine can
raise blood pressure. And serious heart problems may
occur if caffeine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors
(MAO) are taken together. These drugs are used to
treat Parkinson’s disease, depression, and other psychiatric conditions. A pharmacist or physician should be
consulted about which drugs can interact with caffeine.

Furthermore, the blockers alone may not be enough.
People with high blood pressure may also need to
avoid certain foods and keep their weight under control. The health care professional who is treating the

I Calcium channel blockers
Definition
Calcium channel blockers are medicines that slow
the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and
blood vessels. This, in turn, relaxes blood vessels,
increases the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the
heart, and reduces the heart’s workload.

Purpose
Calcium channel blockers are used to treat high
blood pressure, to correct abnormal heart rhythms,
and to relieve the type of chest pain called angina
pectoris. Physicians also prescribe calcium channel
blockers to treat panic attacks and bipolar disorder
(manic depressive illness) and to prevent migraine
headache.

Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking calcium
channel blockers is important. The physician will
check to make certain the medicine is working as it
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Anyone taking calcium channel blockers for high
blood pressure should not take any other prescription
or over-the-counter medication without first checking
with the prescribing physician, as some of these drugs
may increase blood pressure.
Some people feel drowsy or less alert than usual
when taking calcium channel blockers. Anyone who
takes these drugs should not drive, use machines, or do
anything else that might be dangerous until they have
found out how the drugs affect them.
People who normally have chest pain when they
exercise or exert themselves may not have the pain
when they are taking calcium channel blockers. This
could lead them to be more active than they should be.
Anyone taking calcium channel blockers should therefore consult with the prescribing physician concerning
how much exercise and activity may be considered
safe.
Some people get headaches that last for a short
time after taking a dose of this medication. This problem usually goes away during the course of treatment. If it does not, or if the headaches are severe,
the prescribing physician should be informed.
Patients taking certain calcium channel blockers
may need to check their pulse regularly, as the drugs
may slow the pulse too much. If the pulse is too slow,
circulation problems may result. The prescribing physician can show patients the correct way to check their
pulse.
This type of medication may cause the gums to

Those trying to withdraw from caffeine are advised
to do reduce their consumption slowly over time
by substituting decaffeinated or non-caffeinated
products for some of the caffeinated products.

Calcium channel blockers

a medical physician or dentist should be consulted. To
help prevent the problem, care should be taken when
brushing and flossing the teeth. Regular dental checkups and cleanings are also recommended.
Older people may be unusually sensitive to the
effects of calcium channel blockers. This may increase
the chance of side effects.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines may develop problems
if they also take calcium channel blockers. Before
taking these drugs, the prescribing physician should
be informed about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had a previous unusual reaction to any calcium channel blocker should
let his or her physician know before taking the drugs
again. The physician should also be notified about any
allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other
substances.
PREGNANCY. The effects of taking calcium channel blockers during pregnancy have not been studied in
humans. However, in studies of laboratory animals,
large doses of these drugs have been reported to cause
birth defects, stillbirth, poor bone growth, and other
problems when taken during pregnancy. Women who
are pregnant or who may become pregnant should
check with their physicians before using these drugs.
BREASTFEEDING. Some calcium channel blockers
pass into breast milk, but there have been no reports
of problems in nursing babies whose mothers were
taking this type of medication. However, women
who need to take this medicine and want to breastfeed
their babies should check with their physicians.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Calcium channel
blockers may worsen heart or blood vessel disorders.

Side effects
Side effects are not common with this medicine,
but some may occur. Minor discomforts, such as dizziness, lightheadedness, flushing, headache, and nausea,
usually go away as the body adjusts to the drug and do
not require medical treatment unless they persist or
they are bothersome.
If any of the following side effects occur, the prescribing physician should be notified as soon as
possible:


breathing problems, coughing or wheezing



irregular, fast, or pounding heartbeat



slow heartbeat (less than 50 beats per minute)



skin rash



swollen ankles, feet, or lower legs

Other side effects may occur. Anyone who has
unusual symptoms after taking calcium blockers
should contact the prescribing physician.
Interactions
Calcium channel blockers may interact with a
number of other medications. When this happens,
the effects of one or both of the drugs may change or
the risk of side effects may increase. Anyone who takes
calcium channel blockers should not take any other
prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter)
medicines without first checking with the prescribing
physician. Substances that may interact with calcium
channel blockers include:


Diuretics (water pills). This type of medicine may
cause low levels of potassium in the body, which
may increase the chance of unwanted effects from
some calcium channel blockers.



Beta-blockers, such as atenolol (Tenormin), propranolol (Inderal), and metoprolol (Lopressor), used to
treat high blood pressure, angina, and other conditions. Also, eye drop forms of beta blockers, such as
timolol (Timoptic), used to treat glaucoma. Taking any
of these drugs with calcium channel blockers may
increase the effects of both types of medicine and
may cause problems if either drug is stopped suddenly.



Digitalis heart medicines. Taking these medicines
with calcium channel blockers may increase the
action of the heart medication.



Medicines used to correct irregular heart rhythms,
such as quinidine (Quinidex), disopyramide
(Norpace), and procainamide (Procan, Pronestyl).
The effects of these drugs may increase if used with
calcium channel blockers.

The effects of calcium channel blockers may be
greater in people with kidney or liver disease, as their
bodies are slower to clear the drug from their systems.
Certain calcium channel blockers may also cause
problems in people with a history of heart rhythm
problems or with depression, Parkinson’s disease, or
other types of parkinsonism.
USE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES. Taking calcium chan-

nel blockers with certain other drugs may affect the
way the drugs work or may increase the chance of side
effects.
As with most medications, certain side effects are
possible and some interactions with other substances
may occur.



Cyclosporine (Sandimmune), a medicine that suppresses the immune system. Effects may increase if
this drug is taken with calcium channel blockers.



Grapefruit juice may increase the effects of some
calcium channel blockers.

The above list does not include every drug that
may interact with calcium channel blockers. The
prescribing physician or pharmacist will advise as to
whether combining calcium channel blockers with any
other prescription or nonprescription (over-thecounter) medication is appropriate or not.

KEY TERMS
Angina pectoris—A feeling of tightness, heaviness,
or pain in the chest, caused by a lack of oxygen in
the muscular wall of the heart.
Bipolar disorder—A severe mental illness, also
known as manic depression, in which a person
has extreme mood swings, ranging from a highly
excited state—sometimes with a false sense of
well–being—to depression.
Migraine—A throbbing headache that usually
affects only one side of the head. Nausea, vomiting,
increased sensitivity to light, and other symptoms
often accompany migraine.

Description
Calcium channel blockers are available only with
a physician’s prescription and are sold in tablet, capsule, and injectable forms. Some commonly used calcium channel blockers include amlopidine (Norvasc),
diltiazem (Cardizem), isradipine (DynaCirc), nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia), nicardipine (Cardene), and
verapamil (Calan, Isoptin, Verelan).
The recommended dosage depends on the type,
strength, and form of calcium channel blocker and the
condition for which it is prescribed. Correct dosage is
determined by the prescribing physician and further
information can be obtained from the pharmacist.
Calcium channel blockers should be taken as
directed. Larger or more frequent doses should not
be taken, nor should doses be missed. This medicine
may take several weeks to noticeably lower blood
pressure. The patient taking calcium channel blockers
should keep taking the medicine, to give it time to
work. Once it begins to work and symptoms improve,
it should continue to be taken as prescribed.
This medicine should not be discontinued without
checking with the prescribing physician. Some conditions may worsen when patients stop taking calcium
channel blockers abruptly. The prescribing physician
will advise as to how to gradually taper down before
stopping the medication completely.

Risks
A report from the European Cardiology Society
in 2000 found that patients taking certain calcium
channel blockers had a 27% greater risk of heart
attack, and a 26% greater risk of heart failure than
patients taking other high blood pressure medicines.
However, there are many patients affected by
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

conditions that still make calcium channel blockers
the best choice for them. The patient should discuss
this issue with the prescribing physician.

Normal results
The expected result of taking a calcium channel
blocker is to either correct abnormal heart rhythms,
return blood pressure to normal, or relieve chest pain.

Campylobacteriosis

I Campylobacteriosis
Definition
Campylobacteriosis refers to infection by the
group of bacteria known as Campylobacter. The term
comes from the Greek word meaning ‘‘curved rod’’
referring to the bacteria’s curved shape. The most common disease caused by these organisms is diarrhea,
which most often affects children and younger adults.
Campylobacter infections account for a substantial percent of food-borne illness encountered each year.

Complications
Dehydration is the most common complication.
Especially at the extremes of age, this should be
watched for and treated with either Oral Rehydration
Solution or intravenous fluid replacement.
Infection may also involve areas outside the intestine. This is unusual, except for infections with
C. fetus. C. fetus infections tend to occur in those
who have diseases of decreased immunity such as
AIDS, cancer, etc. This subtype is particularly
adapted to protect itself from the body’s defenses.
Areas outside the intestine that may be involved are:


Nervous system involvement either by direct infection
of the meninges (outer covering of the spinal and
brain) or more commonly by producing the GuillainBarré syndrome (progressive and reversible paralysis
or weakness of many muscles). In fact, Campylobacter
may be responsible for 40% of the reported cases of
this syndrome.



Joint inflammation can occur weeks later (leading to
an unusual form of arthritis).



Infection of vessels and heart valves is a special characteristic of C. fetus. Immunocompromised patients
may develop repeated episodes of passage of bacteria
into the bloodstream from these sites of infection.



The gallbladder, pancreas, and bone may be affected.

Description
There are over 15 different subtypes, all of which
are curved Gram-negative rods. C. jeuni is the subtype
that most often causes gastrointestinal disease.
However, some species such as C. fetus produce disease outside the intestine, particularly in those with
altered immune systems, such as people with AIDS,
cancer, and liver disease.
Campylobacter are often found in the intestine of
animals raised for food produce and pets. Infected animals often have no symptoms. Chickens are the most
common source of human infection. It is estimated
that 1% of the general population is infected each year.

Causes and symptoms
Improper or incomplete food preparation is the
most common way the disease is spread, with poultry
accounting for over half the cases. Untreated water
and raw milk are also potential sources.
The incubation period after exposure is from one
to 10 days. A day or two of mild fever, muscle aches,
and headache occur before intestinal symptoms begin.
Diarrhea with or without blood and severe abdominal
cramps are the major intestinal symptoms. The severity of symptoms is variable, ranging from only mild
fever to dehydration and rarely death (mainly in the
very young or old). The disease usually lasts about one
week, but persists longer in about 20% of cases. At
least 10% will have a relapse, and some patients will
continue to pass the bacteria for several weeks.
700

Diagnosis
Campylobacter is only one of many causes of
acute diarrhea. Culture (growing the bacteria in the
laboratory) of freshly obtained diarrhea fluid is the
only way to be certain of the diagnosis.

Treatment
The first aim of treatment is to keep up nutrition
and avoid dehydration. Medications used to treat
diarrhea by decreasing intestinal motility, such as
Loperamide or Diphenoxylate are also useful, but
should only be used with the advice of a physician.
Antibiotics are of value, if started within three days of
onset of symptoms. They are indicated for those with
severe or persistent symptoms. Either an erythromycin
type drug or one of the fluoroquinolones (such as ciprofloxacin) for five to seven days are the accepted
therapies.

Prognosis
Most patients with Campylobacter infection
rapidly recover without treatment. For certain groups
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Antibiotic—A medication that is designed to kill or
weaken bacteria.
Anti-motility medications—Medications such as
loperamide (Imodium), dephenoxylate (Lomotil),
or medications containing codeine or narcotics
which decrease the ability of the intestine to contract. This can worsen the condition of a patient
with dysentery or colitis.
Fluoroquinolones—A relatively new group of antibiotics that have had good success in treating infections with many Gram-negative bacteria. One
drawback is that they should not be used in children under 17 years of age, because of possible
effect on bone growth.
Food-borne illness—A disease that is transmitted
by eating or handling contaminated food.
Gram-negative—Refers to the property of many
bacteria that causes them to not take up color
with Gram’s stain, a method which is used to identify bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria which take up
the stain turn purple, while Gram-negative bacteria
which do not take up the stain turn red.
Guillain-Barré syndrome—Progressive and usually
reversible paralysis or weakness of multiple muscles usually starting in the lower extremities and
often ascending to the muscles involved in respiration. The syndrome is due to inflammation and loss
of the myelin covering of the nerve fibers, often
associated with an acute infection.
Meninges—Outer covering of the spinal cord and
brain. Infection is called meningitis, which can lead
to damage to the brain or spinal cord and even death.
Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)—A liquid
preparation developed by the World Health
Organization that can decrease fluid loss in persons
with diarrhea. Originally developed to be prepared
with materials available in the home, commercial
preparations have recently come into use.
Stool—Passage of fecal material; a bowel movement.

of patients, infection becomes chronic and requires
repeated courses of antibiotics.

Prevention
Good hand washing technique as well as proper
preparation and cooking of food is the best way to
prevent infection.

I Cancer
Definition
Cancer is not just one disease, but a large group of
almost 100 diseases. Its two main characteristics are
uncontrolled growth of the cells in the human body
and the ability of these cells to migrate from the
original site and spread to distant sites. If the spread
is not controlled, cancer can result in death.

Description
One out of every four deaths in the United States
is from cancer. It is second only to heart disease as a
cause of death in the states. About 1.2 million
Americans are diagnosed with cancer annually; more
than 500,000 die of cancer annually.
Cancer can attack anyone. Since the occurrence of
cancer increases as individuals age, most of the cases
are seen in adults, middle-aged or older. Sixty percent
of all cancers are diagnosed in people who are older
than 65 years of age. The most common cancers are
skin cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer (in
women), and prostate cancer (in men). In addition,
cancer of the kidneys, ovaries, uterus, pancreas, bladder, rectum, and blood and lymph node cancer (leukemias and lymphomas) are also included among the
12 major cancers that affect most Americans.
Cancer, by definition, is a disease of the genes.
A gene is a small part of DNA, which is the master
molecule of the cell. Genes make ‘‘proteins,’’ which are
the ultimate workhorses of the cells. It is these proteins
that allow our bodies to carry out all the many
processes that permit us to breathe, think, move, etc.
Throughout people’s lives, the cells in their bodies
are growing, dividing, and replacing themselves.
Many genes produce proteins that are involved in
controlling the processes of cell growth and division.

J A N E T D . R O W L E Y (1925– )
Janet Davison Rowley was born in New York City on
April 5, 1925, to Ethel Mary (Ballantyne) and Hurford
Henry Davison. Rowley attended the University of
Chicago, earning her B.S. degree in 1946 and her M.D.
degree in 1948. She also married Donald A. Rowley in
1948, and the couple ultimately had four sons. Rowley
completed both her internship and residency at Chicago
hospitals before returning to the University of Chicago
Medical School where she conducted research from
1962-1969. She became an associate professor, and
finally, in 1977, earned her position as a full professor.
Rowley’s research has focused on understanding
cancer, with special emphasis on its cytogenetic causes.
Her development and use of Giemsa and quinacrine
stains enabled Rowley to discover oncogenes and to
ultimately show a consistent shifting or translocation of
genetic material in chronic myeloid leukemia cells.
Rowley’s discoveries and continued research have
shown that malignant cells in humans undergo this translocation and deletion of genes that cause tumors to grow.
Her research has given oncologists new pathways to
explore concerning gene therapies for the treatment of
cancer.

body. If the cancer cells have spread to the surrounding tissues, even after the malignant tumor is removed,
it generally recurs.
A majority of cancers are caused by changes in the
cell’s DNA because of damage due to the environment. Environmental factors that are responsible for
causing the initial mutation in the DNA are called
carcinogens, and there are many types.
There are some cancers that have a genetic basis.
In other words, an individual could inherit faulty
DNA from his parents, which could predispose him
to getting cancer. While there is scientific evidence that
both factors (environmental and genetic) play a role,
less than 10% of all cancers are purely hereditary.
Cancers that are known to have a hereditary link are
breast cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, and uterine cancer. Besides genes, certain physiological traits
could be inherited and could contribute to cancers.
For example, inheriting fair skin makes a person
more likely to develop skin cancer, but only if he or
she also has prolonged exposure to intensive sunlight.
There are several different types of cancers:


Carcinomas are cancers that arise in the epithelium
(the layer of cells covering the body’s surface and
lining the internal organs and various glands).
Ninety percent of human cancers fall into this category. Carcinomas can be subdivided into two types:
adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas.
Adenocarcinomas are cancers that develop in an
organ or a gland, while squamous cell carcinomas
refer to cancers that originate in the skin.



Melanomas also originate in the skin, usually in the
pigment cells (melanocytes).



Sarcomas are cancers of the supporting tissues of the
body, such as bone, muscle and blood vessels.



Cancers of the blood and lymph glands are called
leukemias and lymphomas respectively.



Gliomas are cancers of the nerve tissue.

Co-editor and co-founder of the journal, Genes,
Chromosomes and Cancer, Rowley has published an
abundance of materials including Chromosome
Changes in Leukemia (1978), Genes and Cancer (1984),
and Advances in Understanding Genetic Changes in
Cancer (1992). Rowley has also received many awards
and honors for her work and research.

An alteration (mutation) to the DNA molecule can
disrupt the genes and produce faulty proteins. This
causes the cell to become abnormal and lose its
restraints on growth. The abnormal cell begins to
divide uncontrollably and eventually forms a new
growth known as a ‘‘tumor’’ or neoplasm (medical
term for cancer meaning ‘‘new growth’’).
In a healthy individual, the immune system can
recognize the neoplastic cells and destroy them before
they get a chance to divide. However, some mutant
cells may escape immune detection and survive to
become tumors or cancers.
Tumors are of two types, benign or malignant. A
benign tumor is not considered cancer. It is slow growing, does not spread or invade surrounding tissue, and
once it is removed, doesn’t usually recur. A malignant
tumor, on the other hand, is cancer. It invades
surrounding tissue and spreads to other parts of the
702

Causes and symptoms
The major risk factors for cancer are: tobacco,
alcohol, diet, sexual and reproductive behavior, infectious agents, family history, occupation, environment
and pollution.
According to estimates of the American Cancer
Society (ACS), approximately 40% of cancer deaths in
1998 were due to tobacco and excessive alcohol use.
An additional one-third of the deaths were related to
diet and nutrition. Many of the one million skin

cancers diagnosed in 1998 were due to over-exposure
to ultraviolet light from the sun’s rays.
Tobacco
Eighty to 90% of lung cancer cases occur in
smokers. Smoking has also been shown to be a contributory factor in cancers of upper respiratory tract, esophagus, larynx, bladder, pancreas, and probably liver,
stomach, breast, and kidney as well. Recently, scientists
have also shown that second-hand smoke (or passive
smoking) can increase one’s risk of developing cancer.
Alcohol
Excessive consumption of alcohol is a risk factor
in certain cancers, such as liver cancer. Alcohol, in
combination with tobacco, significantly increases the
chances that an individual will develop mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophageal cancers.
Diet
Thirty–five percent of all cancers are due to dietary causes. Excessive intake of fat leading to obesity
has been associated with cancers of the breast, colon,
rectum, pancreas, prostate, gall bladder, ovaries, and
uterus.
Sexual and reproductive behavior
The human papillomavirus, which is sexually
transmitted, has been shown to cause cancer of the
cervix. Having too many sex partners and becoming
sexually active early has been shown to increase one’s
chances of contracting this disease. In addition, it has
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Infectious agents
In the last 20 years, scientists have obtained evidence to show that approximately 15% of the world’s
cancer deaths can be traced to viruses, bacteria, or
parasites. The most common cancer-causing pathogens and the cancers associated with them are shown
in table form.
Family history
Certain cancers like breast, colon, ovarian, and
uterine cancer recur generation after generation in
some families. A few cancers, such as the eye cancer
‘‘retinoblastoma,’’ a type of colon cancer, and a type
of breast cancer known as ‘‘early-onset breast cancer,’’
have been shown to be linked to certain genes that can
be tracked within a family. It is therefore possible that
inheriting particular genes makes a person susceptible
to certain cancers.
Occupational hazards
There is evidence to prove that certain occupational hazards account for 4% of all cancer deaths.
For example, asbestos workers have an increased incidence of lung cancer. Similarly, a higher likelihood of
getting bladder cancer is associated with dye, rubber
and gas workers; skin and lung cancer with smelters,
gold miners and arsenic workers; leukemia with glue
and varnish workers; liver cancer with PVC manufacturers; and lung, bone and bone marrow cancer with
radiologists and uranium miners.
Environment
Radiation is believed to cause 1–2% of all cancer
deaths. Ultra-violet radiation from the sun accounts
for a majority of melanoma deaths. Other sources of
radiation are x rays, radon gas, and ionizing radiation
from nuclear material.
Pollution
Several studies have shown that there is a wellestablished link between asbestos and cancer.
Chlorination of water may account for a small rise in
cancer risk. However, the main danger from pollution
occurs when dangerous chemicals from the industries
escape into the surrounding environment. It has been
estimated that 1% of cancer deaths are due to air,
land, and water pollution.

COMMON PATHOGENS AND THE CANCERS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM

Despite the fact that there are several hundred
different types of cancers, producing very different
symptoms, the ACS has established the following
seven symptoms as possible warning signals of cancer:

Causative Agent



changes in the size, color, or shape of a wart or a mole



a sore that does not heal



persistent cough, hoarseness, or sore throat



a lump or thickening in the breast or elsewhere



unusual bleeding or discharge



chronic indigestion or difficulty in swallowing



any change in bowel or bladder habits

Type of Cancer

Viruses
Papillomaviruses
Hepatitis B virus
Hepatitis C virus
Epstein-Barr virus
Cancers of the upper
pharynx
Human
immunodeficiency
virus (HIV)
Bacteria

Cancer of the cervix
Liver cancer
Liver cancer
Burkitt’s lymphoma
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, Gastric cancers
Kaposi’s sarcoma Lymphoma

Helicobacter pylori

Stomach cancer Lymphomas

Many other diseases, besides cancer, could
produce the same symptoms. However, it is important
to have these symptoms checked, as soon as possible,
especially if they linger. The earlier a cancer is
diagnosed and treated, the better the chance of it
being cured. Many cancers such as breast cancer
may not have any early symptoms. Therefore, it is
important to undergo routine screening tests such as
breast self-exams and mammograms.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis begins with a thorough physical examination and a complete medical history. The doctor
will observe, feel and palpate (apply pressure by
touch) different parts of the body in order to identify
any variations from the normal size, feel, and texture
of the organ or tissue.

nuclei from a human sarcoma. Sarcomas are cancers of the
connective tissue (bone, nerves, smooth muscle).

Cancer is a progressive disease, and goes
through several stages. Each stage may produce
a number of symptoms. Some symptoms are produced early and may occur due to a tumor that is
growing within an organ or a gland. As the tumor
grows, it may press on the nearby nerves, organs,
and blood vessels. This causes pain and some pressure which may be the earliest warning signs of
cancer.
704

As part of the physical exam, the doctor will
inspect the oral cavity, or the mouth. By focusing a
light into the mouth, he will look for abnormalities in
color, moisture, surface texture, or presence of any
thickening or sore in the lips, tongue, gums, the hard
palate on the roof of the mouth, and the throat. To
detect thyroid cancer, the doctor will observe the front
of the neck for swelling. He may gently manipulate the
neck and palpate the front and side surfaces of the
thyroid gland (located at the base of the neck) to detect
any nodules or tenderness. As part of the physical
examination, the doctor will also palpate the lymph
nodes in the neck, under the arms and in the groin.
Many illnesses and cancers cause a swelling of the
lymph nodes.
The doctor may conduct a thorough examination
of the skin to look for sores that have been present for
more than three weeks and that bleed, ooze, or crust;
irritated patches that may itch or hurt, and any change
in the size of a wart or a mole.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

For males, inspection of the rectum and the prostate is also included in the physical examination. The
doctor inserts a gloved finger into the rectum and
rotates it slowly to feel for any growths, tumors, or
other abnormalities. The doctor also conducts an
examination of the testes, where the doctor observes
the genital area and looks for swelling or other
abnormalities. The testicles are palpated to identify
any lumps, thickening or differences in the size, weight
and firmness.
If the doctor detects an abnormality on physical
examination, or the patient has some symptom that
could be indicative of cancer, the doctor may order
diagnostic tests.
Laboratory studies of sputum (sputum cytology),
blood, urine, and stool can detect abnormalities that
may indicate cancer. Sputum cytology is a test where
the phlegm that is coughed up from the lungs is microscopically examined. It is often used to detect lung
cancer. A blood test for cancer is easy to perform,
usually inexpensive and risk-free. The blood sample
is obtained by a lab technician or a doctor by inserting
a needle into a vein and is relatively painless. Blood
tests can be either specific or non-specific. Often, in
certain cancers, the cancer cells release particular proteins (called tumor markers) and blood tests can be
used to detect the presence of these tumor markers.
However, with a few exceptions, tumor markers are
not used for routine screening of cancers, because
several non-cancerous conditions also produce positive results. Blood tests are generally more useful in
monitoring the effectiveness of the treatment, or in
following the course of the disease and detecting recurrent disease.
Imaging tests such as computed tomography scans
(CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound and fiberoptic scope examinations help the doctors determine the location of the tumor even if it is
deep within the body. Conventional x rays are often
used for initial evaluation, because they are relatively
cheap, painless and easily accessible. In order to
increase the information obtained from a conventional
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

x ray, air or a dye (such as barium or iodine) may be
used as a contrast medium to outline or highlight parts
of the body.
The most definitive diagnostic test is the biopsy,
wherein a piece of tissue is surgically removed for
microscope examination. Besides confirming a cancer,
the biopsy also provides information about the type of
cancer, the stage it has reached, the aggressiveness of
the cancer and the extent of its spread. Since a biopsy
provides the most accurate analysis, it is considered
the gold standard of diagnostic tests.
Screening examinations conducted regularly by
healthcare professionals can result in the detection of
cancers of the breast, colon, rectum, cervix, prostate,
testis, tongue, mouth, and skin at early stages, when
treatment is more likely to be successful. Some of the
routine screening tests recommended by the ACS are
sigmoidoscopy (for colorectal cancer), mammography
(for breast cancer), pap smear (for cervical cancer),
and the PSA test (for prostate cancer). Self-examinations for cancers of the breast, testes, mouth, and skin
can also help in detecting the tumors before the symptoms become serious.
A recent revolution in molecular biology and cancer genetics has contributed a great deal to the development of several tests designed to assess one’s risk of
getting cancers. These new techniques include genetic
testing, where molecular probes are used to identify
mutations in certain genes that have been linked to
particular cancers. At present, however, there are a lot
of limitations to genetic testing and its utility appears
ambiguous, emphasizing the need to develop better
strategies for early detection.

Treatment
Treatment and prevention of cancers continue to
be the focus of a great deal of research. In 2003,
research into new cancer therapies included cancertargeting gene therapy, virus therapy, and a drug that
stimulated apoptosis, or self-destruction of cancer
cells, but not healthy cells. However, all of these new
therapies take years of clinical testing and research.
The aim of cancer treatment is to remove all or as
much of the tumor as possible and to prevent the
recurrence or spread of the primary tumor. While
devising a treatment plan for cancer, the likelihood
of curing the cancer has to be weighed against the
side effects of the treatment. If the cancer is very
aggressive and a cure is not possible, then the treatment should be aimed at relieving the symptoms and
controlling the cancer for as long as possible.

Cancer

Examination of the female pelvis is used to detect
cancers of the ovaries, uterus, cervix, and vagina. In
the visual examination, the doctor looks for abnormal
discharges or the presence of sores. Then, using gloved
hands the physician palpates the internal pelvic organs
such as the uterus and ovaries to detect any abnormal
masses. Breast examination includes visual observation where the doctor looks for any discharge, unevenness, discoloration, or scaling. The doctor palpates
both breasts to feel for masses or lumps.

Cancer

Cancer treatment can take many different forms,
and it is always tailored to the individual patient. The
decision on which type of treatment is the most appropriate depends on the type and location of cancer, the
extent to which it has already spread, the patient’s age,
sex, general health status and personal treatment preferences. The major types of treatment are: surgery,
radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone
therapy, and bone-marrow transplantation.

symptoms. In tumors that are dependent on hormones, removal of the organs that secrete the hormones is an option. For example, in prostate cancer,
the release of testosterone by the testicles stimulates the
growth of cancerous cells. Hence, a man may undergo
an ‘‘orchiectomy’’ (removal of testicles) to slow the
progress of the disease. Similarly, in a type of aggressive breast cancer, removal of the ovaries (oophorectomy) will stop the synthesis of hormones from the
ovaries and slow the progression of the cancer.

Surgery
Surgery is the removal of a visible tumor and is the
most frequently used cancer treatment. It is most
effective when a cancer is small and confined to one
area of the body.
Surgery can be used for many purposes.




Treatment. Treatment of cancer by surgery involves
removal of the tumor to cure the disease. This is
typically done when the cancer is localized to a discrete area. Along with the cancer, some part of the
normal surrounding tissue is also removed to ensure
that no cancer cells remain in the area. Since cancer
usually spreads via the lymphatic system, adjoining
lymph nodes may be examined and sometimes are
removed as well.
Preventive surgery. Preventive or prophylactic surgery involves removal of an abnormal looking area
that is likely to become malignant over time. For
example, 40% of people with a colon disease
known as ulcerative colitis, ultimately die of colon
cancer. Rather than live with the fear of developing
colon cancer, these people may choose to have their
colons removed and reduce the risk significantly.



Diagnostic purposes. The most definitive tool for
diagnosing cancer is a biopsy. Sometimes, a biopsy
can be performed by inserting a needle through the
skin. However, at other times, the only way to
obtain a tissue sample for biopsy is by performing
a surgical operation.



Cytoreductive surgery is a procedure where the doctor removes as much of the cancer as possible, and
then treats the remaining area with radiation therapy
or chemotherapy or both.



Palliative surgery is aimed at curing the symptoms, not
the cancer. Usually, in such cases, the tumor is so large
or has spread so much that removing the entire tumor
is not an option. For example, a tumor in the abdomen
may be so large that it may press on and block a
portion of the intestine, interfering with digestion and
causing pain and vomiting. ‘‘Debulking surgery’’ may
remove a part of the blockage and relieve the

706

Radiation therapy
Radiation kills tumor cells. Radiation is used
alone in cases where a tumor is unsuitable for surgery.
More often, it is used in conjunction with surgery and
chemotherapy. Radiation can be either external or
internal. In the external form, the radiation is aimed
at the tumor from outside the body. In internal radiation (also known as brachytherapy), a radioactive
substance in the form of pellets or liquid is placed at
the cancerous site by means of a pill, injection or
insertion in a sealed container.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer
cells. It destroys the hard-to-detect cancer cells that
have spread and are circulating in the body.
Chemotherapeutic drugs can be taken either orally
(by mouth) or intravenously, and may be given alone
or in conjunction with surgery, radiation or both.
When chemotherapy is used before surgery or
radiation, it is known as primary chemotherapy or
‘‘neoadjuvant chemotherapy.’’ An advantage of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is that since the cancer cells
have not been exposed to anti-cancer drugs, they are
especially vulnerable. It can therefore be used effectively to reduce the size of the tumor for surgery or
target it for radiation. However, the toxic effects of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy are severe. In addition, it
may make the body less tolerant to the side effects of
other treatments that follow such as radiation therapy.
The more common use of chemotherapy is adjuvant
therapy, which is given to enhance the effectiveness of
other treatments. For example, after surgery, adjuvant
chemotherapy is given to destroy any cancerous cells
that still remain in the body. In 2003, a new technique
was developed to streamline identification of drug compounds that are toxic to cancerous cells but not to
healthy cells. The technique identified nine dugs, one
of which had never before been identified for use in
cancer treatment. Researchers began looking into
developing the new drug for possible use.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Immunotherapy uses the body’s own immune system to destroy cancer cells. This form of treatment is
being intensively studied in clinical trials and is not yet
widely available to most cancer patients. The various
immunological agents being tested include substances
produced by the body (such as the interferons, interleukins, and growth factors), monoclonal antibodies,
and vaccines. Unlike traditional vaccines, cancer vaccines do not prevent cancer. Instead, they are designed
to treat people who already have the disease. Cancer
vaccines work by boosting the body’s immune system
and training the immune cells to specifically destroy
cancer cells.

cancers respectively. Many other specialists also may
be involved in the care of a cancer patient. For example,
radiologists specialize in the use of x rays, ultrasounds,
CT scans, MRI imaging and other techniques that are
used to diagnose cancer. Hematologists specialize in
disorders of the blood and are consulted in case of
blood cancers and bone marrow cancers. The samples
that are removed for biopsy are sent to a laboratory,
where a pathologist examines them to determine the
type of cancer and extent of the disease. Only some of
the specialists who are involved with cancer care have
been mentioned above. There are many other specialties, and virtually any type of medical or surgical specialist may become involved with care of the cancer
patient should it become necessary.

Hormone therapy
Hormone therapy is standard treatment for some
types of cancers that are hormone-dependent and
grow faster in the presence of particular hormones.
These include cancer of the prostate, breast, and
uterus. Hormone therapy involves blocking the production or action of these hormones. As a result the
growth of the tumor slows down and survival may be
extended for several months or years.
Bone marrow transplantation
The bone marrow is the tissue within the bone
cavities that contains blood-forming cells. Healthy
bone marrow tissue constantly replenishes the blood
supply and is essential to life. Sometimes, the amount
of drugs or radiation needed to destroy cancer cells
also destroys bone marrow. Replacing the bone marrow with healthy cells counteracts this adverse effect.
A bone marrow transplant is the removal of marrow
from one person and the transplant of the blood-forming cells either to the same person or to someone else.
Bone-marrow transplantation, while not a therapy in
itself, is often used to ‘‘rescue’’ patients, by allowing
those with cancer to undergo aggressive therapy.
Many different specialists generally work together
as a team to treat cancer patients. An oncologist is a
physician who specializes in cancer care. The oncologist
provides chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and any
other non-surgical treatment that does not involve
radiation. The oncologist often serves as the primary
physician and coordinates the patient’s treatment plan.
The radiation oncologist specializes in using
radiation to treat cancer, while the surgical oncologist performs the operations needed to diagnose or
treat cancer. Gynecologist-oncologists and pediatriconcologists, as their titles suggest, are physicians
involved with treating women’s and children’s
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Alternative treatment
There are a multitude of alternative treatments
available to help the person with cancer. They can be
used in conjunction with, or separate from, surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Alternative
treatment of cancer is a complicated arena and a
trained health practitioner should be consulted.
Although the effectiveness of complementary
therapies such as acupuncture in alleviating cancer
pain has not been clinically proven, many cancer
patients find it safe and beneficial. Bodywork therapies such as massage and reflexology ease muscle tension and may alleviate side effects such as nausea and
vomiting. Homeopathy and herbal remedies used in
Chinese traditional herbal medicine also have been
shown to alleviate some of the side effects of radiation
and chemotherapy and are being recommended by
many doctors.
Certain foods including many vegetables, fruits,
and grains are believed to offer protection against
various cancers. However, isolation of the individual
constituent of vegetables and fruits that are anti-cancer
agents has proven difficult. In laboratory studies,
vitamins such as A, C and E, as well as compounds
such as isothiocyanates and dithiolthiones found in
broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage, and beta-carotene
found in carrots have been shown to protect against
cancer. Studies have shown that eating a diet rich in
fiber as found in fruits and vegetables reduces the risk
of colon cancer. Exercise and a low fat diet help control weight and reduce the risk of endometrial, breast,
and colon cancer.
Certain drugs, which are currently being used for
treatment, could also be suitable for prevention. For
example, the drug tamoxifen (Nolvadex), which has
been very effective against breast cancer, is currently

being tested by the National Cancer Institute for its
ability to prevent cancer. Similarly, retinoids derived
from vitamin A are being tested for their ability to
slow the progression or prevent head and neck cancers. Certain studies have suggested that cancer incidence is lower in areas where soil and foods are rich in
the mineral selenium. More trials are needed to
explain these intriguing connections.

KEY TERMS
Benign—Mild, nonmalignant. Recovery is favorable with treatment.
Biopsy—The surgical removal and microscopic
examination of living tissue for diagnostic purposes.
Bone marrow—Spongy material that fills the inner
cavities of the bones. The progenitors of all the
blood cells are produced in this bone marrow.
Carcinogen—Any substance capable of causing
cancer by mutating the cell’s DNA.

Prognosis
‘‘Lifetime risk’’ is the term that cancer researchers
use to refer to the probability that an individual over
the course of a lifetime will develop cancer or die from
it. In the United States, men have a one in two lifetime
risk of developing cancer, and for women the risk is one
in three. Overall, African Americans are more likely
to develop cancer than whites. African Americans are
also 30% more likely to die of cancer than whites.

Chemotherapy—Treatment with certain anticancer
drugs.
Epithelium—The layer of cells covering the body’s
surface and lining the internal organs and various
glands.
Hormone therapy—Treatment of cancer by inhibiting the production of hormones such as testosterone and estrogen.

Most cancers are curable if detected and treated at
their early stages. A cancer patient’s prognosis is
affected by many factors, particularly the type of cancer the patient has, the stage of the cancer, the extent
to which it has metastasized and the aggressiveness of
the cancer. In addition, the patient’s age, general
health status and the effectiveness of the treatment
being pursued also are important factors.

Immunotherapy—Treatment of cancer by stimulating the body’s immune defense system.
Malignant—A general term for cells and the tumors
they form that can invade and destroy other tissues
and organs.
Metastasis—The spread of cancer from one part of
the body to another.

To help predict the future course and outcome of
the disease and the likelihood of recovery from
the disease, doctors often use statistics. The five-year
survival rates are the most common measures used.
The number refers to the proportion of people with
cancer who are expected to be alive, five years after
initial diagnosis, compared with a similar population
that is free of cancer. It is important to note that
while statistics can give some information about the
average survival experience of cancer patients in a
given population, it cannot be used to indicate individual prognosis, because no two patients are exactly
alike.

Prevention
According to nutritionists and epidemiologists
from leading universities in the United States, a person
can reduce the chances of getting cancer by following
some simple guidelines:

Radiation therapy—Treatment using high-energy
radiation from x-ray machines, cobalt, radium, or
other sources.
Sore—An open wound, bruise or lesion on the skin.
Tumor—An abnormal growth resulting from a cell
that lost its normal growth control restraints and
started multiplying uncontrollably.
X rays—High–energy radiation used in high doses,
either to diagnose or treat disease.

I Cancer therapy, definitive
Definition
Definitive cancer therapy is a treatment plan
designed to potentially cure cancer using one or a
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

combination of interventions including surgery, radiation, chemical agents, or biological therapies.

Purpose
The primary purpose of definitive care is to establish a cure and to destruct and remove all cancer cells
from the infected person.
Surgery is not only a diagnostic tool, but also used
for tumor removal. The surgeon usually identifies
potential candidates for tumor removal and repairs
intraoperatively (during the operation procedure).
Surgery can be curative for some stomach, genital/
urinary, thyroid, breast, skin, and central nervous
system cancers. The best chance for a surgical cure is
usually with the first operation. It is essential that the
cancer surgeon (oncologic surgeon) be experienced in
the specific procedure.
Radiation therapy is commonly administered to
approximately 50% of cancer patients during the
course of illness. It can be used as the sole method of
cure for tumors in the mouth and neighboring structures in the oral cavity, vagina, prostate, cervix, esophagus, Hodgkin’s disease, and certain types of cancer
in the spinal cord and brain. Research and clinical
trials have demonstrated that combination treatment
is more effective than radiation therapy alone.
Chemotherapy is curative for only a small percentage of cancers. It is most effective for choriocarcinoma, cancer of the testis, some types of lymphomas,
and cancer of skeletal muscles.
Biological therapies are a new and promising
direction for cancer cures. Usually when cancer cells
grow they manage to derive a blood supply that allows
passage of nutrients promoting continuation of
abnormal cancer growth. Research that focuses on
destroying these blood vessels is called angiogenesis.
Cutting off the blood supply has been shown to
destroy tumors, since this stops the flow of essential
nutrients required for cancer growth. Use of certain
growth factors also can stimulate self-destructive
pathways in cancer cells (apoptosis). Gene therapy is
directed toward inhibiting specific cellular signals that
promote cancer cell multiplication. The importance of
gene therapy in coming years will likely increase as
scientists made progress in 2002 and 2003 are mapping
the human genes (The Human Genome Project) and
identifying new ways to fight and perhaps cure cancer.
By using genetics, they hope to find new ways to
activate human defenses against tumor cells and
delay viral attacks on cells. Many trials were underway
in 2003 that showed great promise. One of these in

proven as risk factors for certain cancers can help
lower one’s risk. For instance, while physicians have
long known a small increased risk for breast cancer
was linked to use of HRT, a landmark study released
in 2003 proved the risk was greater than thought. The
Women’s Health Initiative found that even relatively
short-term use of estrogen plus progestin is associated
with increased risk of breast cancer, diagnosis at a
more advanced stage of the disease, and a higher
number of abnormal mammograms. The longer a
woman used HRT, the more her risk increased.

Cancer therapy, definitive

2003 combined gene therapy and chemotherapy to
stop breast cancer and its spread (metastasis).

Precautions
Surgical resection requires an experienced surgeon, preoperative assessment, imaging studies, and
delicate operative technique. Care should be taken
during the procedure to avoid unnecessary tumor
manipulation, which can cause cancer cells to infiltrate
adjacent structures. If manipulation is excessive, cells
can enter nearby areas for future re-growth. Accurate
isolation of the tumor also can help avoid contamination of the surgical area. Early ligation of the blood
supply to the tumor is an essential component of a
surgical cure.
Radiation therapy requires extensive treatment
planning and imaging. Care must be taken to localize
the cancer field while attempting to spare destruction
of normal tissue. This requires image monitoring and
exact positioning during radiation treatment sessions.
Chemotherapy usually causes destruction of normal cells, and cancer cells can become immune to
chemical destruction. Side effects and patient tolerance issues typically are anticipated and dosages may
have to be specifically altered. Very few chemotherapeutic agents offer curative responses.
Biological therapies may cause patient toxicity
resulting in extensive side effects. This can occur
since the optimal dose may be exceedingly elevated
above patient tolerance.

Description
Surgery
Surgical removal of the tumor must be performed with care and accuracy. The surgeon must
avoid overmanipulation of the surgical field. Too
much movement within the area can cause cancer
cell displacement into surrounding tissue. If this
occurs and no further treatment is indicated, the
tumor may grow again. The surgeon also should perform an assessment concerning tissue removal
around the cancer site. Tissue around the site may
not by inspection seem cancerous, but adjacent structures may have cancer cells and surrounding tissue
removal is usually part of the operative procedure.
Pieces of tumor and the surrounding area are analyzed microscopically during the operation for cell
type. An adequate resection (removal of tissue) will
reveal normal cells in the specimens analyzed from
areas bordering the cancerous growth. Surgery also
710

can help to decrease the tumor bulk and, along with
other treatment measures, may provide a cure for
certain cancers. However, surgery is not always the
best answer. It generally works best on slow-growing
cancers.
Not only can surgery be curative for some cancers, but it is an essential diagnostic tool that must be
assessed intraoperatively since microscopic analysis
will guide the surgeon concerning tumor and surrounding tissue removal. These diagnostic procedures include an aspiration biopsy, which inserts a
needle to extract (aspirate) fluid contained inside a
cancerous growth; a needle biopsy uses a specialized
needle to obtain a core tissue specimen; an incision
biopsy removes a section from a large tumor; and an
excision biopsy removes the entire tumor. The surgeon also can take samples of neighboring lymph
nodes. Cancer in surrounding lymph nodes is an
important avenue for distant spread of cancer to
other areas. If microscopic analysis determines the
presence of cancer cells in lymph nodes, the surgeon
may decide to perform a more aggressive surgical
approach.
Radiation therapy
Similar to surgical intervention, radiation therapy
is a localized treatment. It involves the administration
of ionizing radiation to a solid tumor location. This
generates reactive oxygen molecules, causing the
destruction of DNA in local cells. There are three
commonly used radiation therapy beams: gamma
rays from a linear accelerator machine produce a
focused beam; orthovoltage rays are of less energy,
thus penetrate less and typically deliver higher doses
to superficial tissues (efficient for treating skin cancers); and megavoltage rays are high energy producing
beams that can penetrate deeply situated internal
organs, while sparing extensive skin damage. Two
common routes can deliver radiation. Brachytherapy
delivers radiation to a local area by placing radioactive
materials within close proximity to the cancerous site.
Teletherapy delivers radiation to a specific area using
an external beam machine.
Chemotherapy
Curative chemotherapy usually requires multiple
administrations of the chemical agent. Chemotherapy
or systemic therapy is administered in the blood and
circulates through the entire body. The choice of
chemotherapeutic agents depends on the specific type
of cancer. Chemotherapy is more commonly used for
metastatic (malignant cancer which has spread to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Biologic therapy
Biologic therapies primarily function to alter the
patient’s response to cancer. These treatments are
mostly investigations and there are numerous
research protocols studying the effects of biologic
treatments. These protocols usually have strict
admission criteria that may exclude potential candidates who can benefit from treatment. These treatments tend to stimulate specific immune cells or
immune chemicals to destroy cancer cells.

microsurgery of blood vessels) can restore new tissues
to a previous surgery site.

Preparation
For all treatment modalities imaging studies,
biopsy, and constant blood analysis is essential before,
during, and after treatments. Surgical candidates
should undergo extensive pre-operative evaluation
with imaging studies, blood chemistry analysis, stabilized health status, and readiness of staff for any
potential complications and cell biopsy analysis.
Patients with other pre-existing chronic disease may
require intensive post-operative monitoring.
For radiotherapy, the patient undergoes extensive
imaging studies. Additional planning strategies
include beam localization to spare normal tissues,
calibration of fractionated doses, and specific positioning during treatment sessions.
Patients who receive curative chemotherapy
should be informed of possible side effects associated
with the chemotherapeutic agent. Patients should also
be informed of temporary lifestyle changes and medications that may offer some symptomatic relief.
Patients undergoing biologic therapies are usually
advised of potential side effects, treatment cycles and
specific tests for monitoring progress according to the
specific research protocol.

Aftercare
Patients will typically be evaluated by imaging
studies, blood analysis, physical examination, and
health improvement. These follow-up visits usually
occur at specific time intervals during the course of
treatment. Surgical patients may require closer observation during the initial post-operative period to avoid
potential complications. Reconstructive surgery can be
considered to improve appearance and restore function. Certain surgical procedures (such as flaps and

Risks
Surgical risks
Surgical therapy can be both disfiguring and disabling. Many normal tissues can be adversely affected
by radiation therapy. Side effects that commonly
occur shortly after a treatment cycle include nausea,
vomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite, and bone marrow
suppression (a decrease in the cells that provide
defense against infections and those that carry oxygen
to cells).
Radiation risks
Radiation therapy also can cause difficulty swallowing, oral gum disease, and dry mouth. Additionally,
radiation therapy can cause damage to local structures
within the irradiated field.
Chemotherapy risks
Chemotherapy commonly causes bone marrow
suppression. Additionally, cells called platelets—
important for normal blood clotting—may be significantly lowered, causing patients to bleed. This may be
problematic enough to limit the treatment course.
Bone marrow suppression can increase susceptibility
to infection and also cause infertility. Patients commonly have bouts of nausea and vomiting shortly after
a treatment session. Rapidly multiplying normal cells
also are affected such as skin cells (causing blistering
and ulceration) and hair cells causing loss of hair, a
condition called alopecia).

treatment planning process. Therapeutic planning
usually involves careful coordination with the treatment team. The approach to palliative care also
involves easing psychosocial problems and an
emphasis on the patient’s family.
Surgery can be utilized for palliation after careful
evaluation and planning. The use of surgery in these
cases may reduce the tumor bulk and help improve
the quality of life by relieving pain, alleviating
obstruction, or controlling bleeding. Radiation therapy for terminal cancer patients can also alleviate
pain, bleeding, and obstruction of neighboring
areas. New research in 2003 showed that using a
combination of radiation therapy bisphosphanates
helped offer palliative relief to patients with metastatic bone disease (metastatic disease is cancer that
has spread beyond the original site or organ to other
areas of the body). Chemotherapy may be helpful
to reduce tumor size and provide some reduction
to metastatic disease. Long-term chemotherapy
patients develop drug resistance, a situation that renders chemotherapeutic treatments ineffective. If this
occurs, patients usually are given a second line medication or, if admission criteria are met, they may
participate in an experimental research protocol.
Palliative treatments and terminal cancer in combination can cause many symptoms that can become
problematic. These symptoms commonly include
pain, nausea, vomiting, difficulty in breathing, constipation, dehydration, agitation, and delirium. The palliative treatment-planning goal focuses on reducing
these symptoms.

Precautions

I Cancer therapy, palliative
Definition
Palliative cancer therapy is treatment specifically
directed to help improve the symptoms associated
with terminal cancer.

Purpose
Palliative care is directed to improving symptoms
associated with incurable cancer. Care can include
surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, symptomatic treatments resulting from cancer, and side
effects of treatment. The primary objective of palliative care is to improve the quality of the remainder of
a patient’s life. Treatment usually involves a combination of modalities (multimodality approach) and
numerous specialists typically are involved in the
712

Surgery for tumor removal, biopsy, or size reduction is associated with postoperative pain and local
nerve damage, which may be both severe and difficult
to alleviate. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy also
can produce nerve damage and severe pain.
Additionally, patients with malignant cancer are susceptible to infections like herpes, pneumonia, urinary
tract infections, and wound abscess, all of which can
cause severe pain. Pain associated with cancer and/or
treatments can significantly impair the patient’s abilities to perform daily tasks and hence impair quality of
life. These complications may negatively impact the
patient’s psychological well-being.

Description
Pain is one of the common symptoms associated
with cancer. Approximately 75% of terminal cancer
patients have pain. Pain is a subjective symptom
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Preparation
Patients typically are informed that their diagnosis is terminal and treatments are directed to improve
quality of life an ease suffering for the remaining time.
Treatment also is aimed to minimize emotional suffering associated with pain.
A careful history is necessary to assess duration,
severity, and location of pain. A physical examination
may verify the presence of pain. Imaging analysis may
further confirm the presence of potential causes
of pain. The World Health Organization (WHO)
recommends an analgesic ladder. This treatment
approach provides medication selections based on
previous analgesic use and severity of pain. The ladder
starts with the use of non-opioid (non-morphine)
drugs such as aspirin, acetaminophen, or non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) for control
of mild pain. Chronic pain must be treated with constant and consistently administered medication(s).
The ‘‘take as needed’’ approach is not advised.
Supplemental doses may be recommended in addition
to the standard dose for circumstances that may worsen pain. Opioids (i.e., morphine and codeine) are the
medications of choice for moderate to severe pain.
Doses are adjusted to produce maximum pain relief
while minimizing side effects. These medications are
conveniently administered orally. Administering steroids can help reduce nausea and vomiting. Delirium
and anxiety may be improved by psychoactive
medications.

Aftercare
Care for palliation is continuous and consistent
for the remainder of life. Patients who have less than
six months of life remaining may choose a hospice to
stop treatment and control pain. Nutritional care is

and welfare.

an important part of palliative care, since many
patients suffer malnourishing effects of radiation
and chemotherapy and those who can maintain pleasure from food should. A proper diet can offset
effects of the many medications patients on palliative
care may receive.

Risks
Patients taking opioids for pain relief can develop
tolerance and dependence. Tolerance develops when a
patient requires increasing amounts of medication to
produce pain reduction. Dependence shows characteristic withdrawal symptoms if medications are abruptly
stopped. These symptoms can be avoided by tapering

and thus it cannot be measured using technological
approaches. Pain can be assessed using numeric scales
(from one to 10, one is rated as no pain while 10 is
severe) or rating specific facial expressions associated
with various levels of pain. The majority of cancer
patients experience pain as a result of tumor mass
that compresses neighboring nerves, bone, or soft tissues, or from direct nerve injury (neuropathic pain).
Pain can occur from affected nerves in the ribs, muscles, and internal structures such as the abdomen
(cramping type pain associated with obstruction).
Many patients also experience various types of pain
as a direct result of follow-up tests, treatments (surgery, radiation, and chemo–therapy) and diagnostic
procedures (i.e., biopsy).

I Cancer therapy, supportive
Definition
Supportive cancer therapy is the use of medicines
to counteract unwanted effects of cancer treatment.

Purpose
Along with their beneficial effects, many cancer
treatments produce uncomfortable and sometimes
harmful side effects. For example, cancer drugs may
cause nausea or vomiting. They also may destroy red or
white blood cells, resulting in a low blood count.
Fortunately, many of these side effects can be relieved
with other medicines.

Description
Different kinds of drugs are used for different
purposes in supportive cancer therapy. To relieve nausea and vomiting, a physician may prescribe dolasetron
(Anzemet), granisetron (Kytril) or ondansetron
(Zofran). Drugs called colony stimulating factors are
used to help the bone marrow make new white blood
cells to replace those destroyed by cancer treatment.
Examples of colony stimulating factors are filgrastim
(Neupogen) and sargramostim (Leukine). Another
type of drug, epoetin (Epogen, Procrit), stimulates
the bone marrow to make new red blood cells and
help patients overcome anemia. It is a synthetically
made version of human erythropoietin that is made
naturally in the body and has the same effect on bone
marrow.
Some physicians who treat cancer recommend
that their patients use marijuana to relieve nausea
and vomiting. This practice is controversial for several reasons. Using marijuana, even for medicinal
purposes, is illegal in most states. Also, most of the
evidence that marijuana effectively relieves nausea
and vomiting comes from reports of people who
have used it, not from carefully designed scientific
714

studies called clinical trials. An oral medication
that contains one of the active ingredients of marijuana is available with a physician’s prescription and
sometimes is used to treat nausea and vomiting in
patients undergoing cancer treatment. However, the
drug, dronabinol (Marinol), takes longer to work
than smoked marijuana and may be difficult for
patients with nausea and vomiting to swallow and
keep down.
In 1997, the National Institutes of Health issued a
report calling for more research into medical uses of
marijuana. The panel of experts who wrote the report
also recommended that researchers investigate other
ways of getting the active ingredients of marijuana
into the body, such as nasal sprays, skin patches and
inhalers. In 2000, the American Cancer Society funded
research into a skin patch. A 2003 report said
that a University of Kentucky researcher had applied
for a patent for the patch which used synthetic
cannabinoids.
Patients who want to use marijuana to relieve side
effects of cancer treatment should talk to their physicians and should carefully consider the benefits and
risks, both medical and legal.

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type
of supportive cancer therapy. The physician who
prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the
prescription can recommend the correct dosage.

Precautions
Dolasetron, granisetron and ondansetron
If severe nausea and vomiting occur after taking
this medicine, patients should check with a physician.
The use of ondansetron after abdominal surgery
may cover up symptoms of stomach problems.
People with liver disease may be more likely to
have side effects from ondansetron.
Colony stimulating factors
Certain cancer drugs reduce the body’s ability to
fight infections. Although colony stimulating factors
help restore the body’s natural defenses, the process
takes time. Getting prompt treatment for infections is
important, even while taking this medicine. A patient
should call the physician at the first sign of illness or
infection, such as a sore throat, fever or chills.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

People with certain medical conditions may have
problems if they take colony stimulating factors. In
people who have kidney disease, liver disease, or conditions caused by inflammation or immune system
problems, colony stimulating factors may make these
problems worse. People with heart disease may be
more likely to have side effects such as water retention
and heart rhythm problems when they take these
drugs. And people with lung disease may be more
likely to have shortness of breath. Anyone who has
any of these medical conditions should check with
his or her physician before using colony stimulating
factors.
Epoetin
This medicine may cause seizures (convulsions),
especially in people with a history of seizures. Anyone
who takes these drugs should not drive, use machines
or do anything else that might be dangerous if they
have had a seizure.
Epoetin helps the body make new red blood cells,
but it cannot do its job unless there is plenty of iron in
the body. The physician may recommend taking iron
supplements or certain vitamins that help get iron into
the body. Following the physician’s orders to make
sure the body has enough iron for this medicine makes
it work. Iron supplements should not be taken unless
they are prescribed by a physician.
In studies of laboratory animals, epoetin taken
during pregnancy caused birth defects, including
damage to the bones and spine. However, the drug
has not been reported to cause problems in human
babies whose mothers take it. Women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant should check
with their physicians for the most up-to-date information on the safety of taking this medicine during
pregnancy.
People with certain medical conditions may have
problems if they take this medicine. For example, the
chance of side effects may be greater in people with
high blood pressure, heart or blood vessel disease or a
history of blood clots. Epoetin may not work properly
in people who have bone problems or sickle cell
anemia.
Research continues on the benefits of epoetin as a
supportive cancer therapy. One 2003 report said new
research showed doubt as to its effectiveness in treating anemia, while other reports confirmed it worked
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

well. In mid-2003, a new large clinical trial (CREATE)
was beginning in England to help determine epoetin’s
effectiveness.
Dronabinol
This medicine contains sesame oil and one of the
active ingredients of marijuana. Anyone who has had
allergic or unusual reactions to sesame oil or marijuana products should let his or her physician know
before taking dronabinol.
Because dronabinol works on the central nervous
system, it may add to the effects of alcohol and other
drugs that slow down the central nervous system.
Examples of these drugs are antihistamines, cold medicine, allergy medicine, sleep aids, medicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain relievers, and muscle
relaxants. Dronabinol also may add to the effects of
anesthetics, including those used for dental procedures. Anyone taking dronabinol should not drink
alcohol and should check with his or her physician
before taking any of the drugs listed above.
This drug makes some people feel drowsy, dizzy,
lightheaded or ‘‘high,’’ with a sense of well-being.
Because of these possible reactions, anyone who
takes dronabinol should not drive, use machines or
do anything else that might be dangerous until they
have found out how the drug affects them. The dizziness and lightheadedness are especially likely when
getting up after sitting or lying down. Getting up
gradually and holding onto something for support
should lessen the problem.
In laboratory studies, giving high doses of dronabinol to pregnant animals increased the risk of the
unborn baby’s death. The medicine’s effects on pregnant women have not been studied. Women who are
pregnant or who may become pregnant should check
with their physicians before taking this medicine.
Dronabinol passes into breast milk and may
affect nursing babies whose mothers take the medicine. Women who are breastfeeding their babies
should check with their physicians before using
dronabinol.
Because of its possible mind-altering effects, dronabinol should be used with care in children and
older people. Both children and older people should
be watched carefully when they are taking this
medicine.
Using dronabinol may worsen some medical conditions, including high blood pressure, heart disease,
bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

Cancer therapy, supportive

Seeing a physician regularly while taking this
medicine is important. This will give the physician a
chance to make sure the medicine is working and to
check for unwanted side effects.

Cancer therapy, supportive

General precautions for all types of supportive
cancer therapy
Anyone who previously has had unusual reactions
to drugs used in supportive cancer therapy should
let his or her physician know before taking the drugs
again. The physician should also be told about
any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other
substances.

Certain side effects should be brought to a physician’s attention as soon as possible. These include
headache, vision problems, increased blood pressure,
fast heartbeat, weight gain, and swelling of the face,
fingers, lower legs, ankles or feet.
Anyone who has chest pain or seizures after
taking epoetin should check with a physician
immediately.

Side effects
Dolasetron, granisetron and ondansetron
The most common minor side effects are headache,
dizziness or lightheadedness, drowsiness, dry mouth,
diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain or stomach
cramps and unusual tiredness or weakness. These problems usually do not require medical treatment.
A physician should be notified as soon as possible
if fever occurs after taking granisetron.
If any of these symptoms occur after taking
ondansetron, the patient should check with a physician immediately:

Dronabinol
Side effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, confusion and clumsiness or unsteadiness usually do not
need medical attention unless they are long-lasting or
they interfere with normal activities.
Other side effects or signs of overdose should have
immediate medical attention. These include:


fast or pounding heartbeat



constipation



trouble urinating



red eyes



breathing problems or wheezing



slurred speech



chest pain or tightness in chest



skin rash, hives or itching

mood changes, including depression, nervousness or
anxiety



confusion



forgetfulness



changes in sight, smell, taste, touch or hearing



a sense that time is speeding up or slowing down



hallucinations

Colony stimulating factors
As this medicine starts to work, it may cause mild
pain in the lower back or hips. This is nothing to worry
about, and it will usually go away within a few days. If
the pain is too uncomfortable, the physician may prescribe a painkiller. A physician needs to know if the
painkiller does not help.
Other possible side effects include headache, joint
or muscle pain, and skin rash or itching. These side
effects usually go away as the body adjusts to the
medicine and do not need medical treatment. If they
continue or interfere with normal activities, a physician should be notified.
Epoetin
This medicine may cause flu-like symptoms, such
as muscle aches, bone pain, fever, chills, shivering, and
sweating, within a few hours after it is taken. These
symptoms usually go away within 12 hours. If they do
not, or if they are troubling, a physician should be
told. Other possible side effects that do not need medical attention are diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, and
tiredness or weakness.
716

General advice on side effects for all types
of supportive cancer therapy
Other side effects are possible with any type of
supportive cancer therapy. Anyone who has unusual
symptoms during or after treatment with these drugs
should get in touch with his or her physician.

Interactions
Anyone who has supportive cancer therapy
should let the physician know all other medicines he
or she is taking. Some combinations of drugs may
interact, which may increase or decrease the effects
of one or both drugs or may increase the risk of side
effects. Patients should ask their physician if the possible interactions can interfere with drug therapy or
cause harmful effects.

Candidiasis

KEY TERMS

I Candidiasis
Definition
Candidiasis is an infection caused by a species of
the yeast Candida, usually Candida albicans. This is a
common cause of vaginal infections in women. Also,
Candida may cause mouth infections in people with
reduced immune function, or in patients taking certain antibiotics. Candida can be found in virtually all
normal people but causes problems in only a fraction.
In recent years, however, several serious categories of
candidiasis have become more common, due to overuse of antibiotics, the rise of AIDS, the increase in
organ transplantations, and the use of invasive
devices (catheters, artificial joints and valves)—all
of which increase a patient’s susceptibility to
infection.

Description
Vaginal candidiasis
Over one million women in the United States
develop vaginal yeast infections each year. It is not
life-threatening, but it can be uncomfortable and
frustrating.
Oral candidiasis
This disorder, also known as thrush, causes white,
curd-like patches in the mouth or throat.
Deep organ candidiasis
Also known as invasive candidiasis, deep organ
candidiasis is a serious systemic infection that can
affect the esophagus, heart, blood, liver, spleen, kidneys, eyes, and skin. Like vaginal and oral candidiasis,
it is an opportunistic disease that strikes when a person’s resistance is lowered, often due to another illness. There are many diagnostic categories of
deep organ candidiasis, depending on the tissues
involved.

Causes and symptoms
Vaginal candidiasis
Most women with vaginal candidiasis experience
severe vaginal itching. They also have a discharge that
often looks like cottage cheese and has a sweet or
bread-like odor. The vulva and vagina can be red,
swollen, and painful. Sexual intercourse can also be
painful.

RACHEL FULLER BROWN
(1898–1980)
Rachel Fuller Brown was born on November 23,
1898 in Springfield, Massachusetts. Brown was the
oldest of two children born to Annie (Fuller) and
George Hamilton Brown. In 1912, her father left their
family in Missouri and her mother moved the family
back to Springfield. Brown double majored in history
and chemistry at Mount Holyoke, receiving her A.B.
degree in 1920. She also earned her M.A. degree from
the University of Chicago. Brown began her doctoral
studies at the University, but she experienced financial
difficulties and took a job before she received her
Ph.D. She worked at the Division of Laboratories and
Research of the New York State Department of Health
as an assistant chemist for seven years and finally
returned to Chicago and completed her Ph.D.
In 1948, Brown and Elizabeth Hazen began
researching fungal infections found in humans due to
antibiotic treatments and diseases. Some of the antibiotics they discovered did indeed kill the fungus; however, they also killed the test mice. Finally, Hazen
located a microorganism on a farm in Virginia, and
Brown’s tests indicated that the microorganism produced
two antibiotics, one of which proved effective for treating fungus and candidiasis in humans. Brown purified
the antibiotic which was patented under the name nystatin. In 1954, the antibiotic became available in pill
form. Brown and Hazen continued their research and
discovered two other antibiotics. Brown received
numerous awards individually and with her research
partner, Elizabeth Hazen. Rachel Brown passed away
on January 14, 1980.

Oral candidiasis
Whitish patches can appear on the tongue, inside
of the cheeks, or the palate. Oral candidiasis typically
occurs in people with abnormal immune systems.
These can include people undergoing chemotherapy
for cancer, people taking immunosuppressive drugs
to protect transplanted organs, or people with HIV
infection.
Deep organ candidiasis
Anything that weakens the body’s natural barrier
against colonizing organisms—including stomach surgery, burns, nasogastric tubes, and catheters—can predispose a person for deep organ candidiasis. Rising
numbers of AIDS patients, organ transplant recipients, and other individuals whose immune systems

are compromised help account for the dramatic
increase in deep organ candidiasis in recent years.
Patients with granulocytopenia (deficiency of white
blood cells) are particularly at risk for deep organ
candidiasis.

Diagnosis
Often clinical appearance gives a strong suggestion about the diagnosis. Generally, a clinician will
take a sample of the vaginal discharge or swab an
area of oral plaque, and then inspect this material
under a microscope. Under the microscope, it is possible to see characteristic forms of yeasts at various
stages in the lifecycle.
Fungal blood cultures should be taken for
patients suspected of having deep organ candidiasis.
Tissue biopsy may be needed for a definitive
diagnosis.

Treatment
Vaginal candidiasis
In most cases, vaginal candidiasis can be treated
successfully with a variety of over-the-counter antifungal creams or suppositories. These include
Monistat, Gyne-Lotrimin, and Mycelex. However,
infections often recur. If a women has frequent

others.

Opportunistic—Infection caused by microorganisms that are usually harmless, but which can

Prognosis
Vaginal candidiasis

Oral candidiasis
This is usually treated with prescription lozenges
or mouthwashes. Some of the most-used prescriptions
are nystatin mouthwashes (Nilstat or Nitrostat) and
clotrimazole lozenges.
Deep organ candidiasis
The recent increase in deep organ candidiasis has
led to the creation of treatment guidelines, including,
but not limited to, the following: Catheters should be
removed from patients in whom these devices are still
present. Antifungal chemotherapy should be started
to prevent the spread of the disease. Drugs should be
prescribed based on a patient’s specific history and
defense status.

Alternative treatment
Home remedies for vaginal candidiasis include
vinegar douches or insertion of a paste made from
Lactobacillus acidophilus powder into the vagina. In
theory, these remedies will make the vagina more
acidic and therefore less hospitable to the growth of
Candida. Fresh garlic (Allium sativum) is believed to
have antifungal action, so incorporating it into the diet
or inserting a gauze-wrapped, peeled garlic clove into
the vagina may be helpful. The insert should be changed twice daily. Some women report success with these
remedies; they should try a conventional treatment if
an alternative remedy isn’t effective.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Although most cases of vaginal candidiasis are
cured reliably, these infections can recur. To limit
recurrences, women may need to take a prescription
anti-fungal drug such as terconazole (sold as Terazol)
or take other anti-fungal drugs on a preventive basis.
Oral candidiasis
These infections can also recur, sometimes
because the infecting Candida develops resistance to
one drug. Therefore, a physician may need to prescribe
a different drug.
Deep organ candidiasis
The prognosis depends on the category of disease
as well as on the condition of the patient when the
infection strikes. Patients who are already suffering
from a serious underlying disease are more susceptible
to deep organ candidiasis that speads throughout
the body.

Prevention
Because Candida is part of the normal group of
microorganisms that co-exist with all people, it is
impossible to avoid contact with it. Good vaginal
hygiene and good oral hygiene might reduce problems,
but they are not guarantees against candidiasis.
Because hospital-acquired (nosocomial) deep
organ candidiasis is on the rise, people need to be
made aware of it. Patients should be sure that catheters

I Canker sores
Definition
Canker sores are small sores or ulcers that appear
inside the mouth. They are painful, self-healing, and
can recur.

Description
Canker sores occur on the inside of the mouth,
usually on the inside of the lips, cheeks, and/or soft
palate. They can also occur on the tongue and in the
throat. Often, several canker sores will appear at
the same time and may be grouped in clusters.
Canker sores appear as a whitish, round area with a
red border. The sores are painful and sensitive to
touch. The average canker sore is about one-quarter
inch in size, although they can occasionally be larger.
Canker sores are not infectious.
Approximately 20% of the U.S. population is
affected with recurring canker sores, and more
women than men get them. Women are more likely
to have canker sores during their premenstrual period.
Canker sores are sometimes confused with cold
sores. Cold sores are caused by herpes simplex virus.
This disease, also known as oral herpes or fever blisters, can occur anywhere on the body. Most commonly, herpes infection occurs on the outside of the
lips and the gums, and much less frequently on the
inside the mouth. Cold sores are infectious.

Causes and symptoms
The exact cause of canker sores is uncertain, however, they seem to be related to a localized immune
reaction. Other proposed causes for this disease are
720

trauma to the affected areas from toothbrush scrapes,
stress, hormones, and food allergies. Canker sores tend
to appear in response to stress. The initial symptom is
a tingling or mildly painful itching sensation in the area
where the sore will appear. After one to several days, a
small red swelling appears. The sore is round, and is a
whitish color with a grayish colored center. Usually,
there is a red ring of inflammation surrounding the
sore. The main symptom is pain. Canker sores can be
very painful, especially if they are touched repeatedly,
e.g., by the tongue. They last for one to two weeks.

Diagnosis
Canker sores are diagnosed by observation of the
blister. A distinction between canker sores and cold
sores must be made because cold sores are infectious
and the herpes infection can be transmitted to other
people. The two sores can usually be distinguished
visually and there are specific diagnostic tests for
herpes infection.

Treatment
Since canker sores heal by themselves, treatment is
not usually necessary. Pain relief remedies, such as topical anesthetics, may be used to reduce the pain of the
sores. The use of corticosteroid ointments sometimes
speeds healing. Avoidance of spicy or acidic foods can
help reduce the pain associated with canker sores.

Alternative treatment
Alternative therapies for canker sores are aimed at
healing existing sores and preventing their recurrence.
Several herbal remedies, including calendula (Calendula
officinalis), myrrh (Commiphora molmol ), and goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), may be helpful in the treatment of existing sores. Compresses soaked in teas made

glucose (the form in which sugar circulates in the
blood), fructose (found in fruit and honey), and galactose (produced by the digestion of milk). These simple
sugars are important because they can be absorbed by
the small intestine. Two simple sugars linked together
make a disaccharide. The disaccharide sugars present
in the diet are maltose (a product of the digestion of
starch), sucrose (table sugar), and lactose (the sugar in
milk). These disaccharides must be broken down by
enzymes into two simple sugars so that they can be
absorbed by the intestine. Polysaccharides are much
more complex carbohydrates made up of many simple
sugars, the most important of which are glycogen,
which is stored in the liver, and starch.

I Carbohydrate intolerance
Definition
Carbohydrate intolerance is the inability of the
body to completely process the nutrient carbohydrate
(a classification that includes sugars and starches) into
a source of energy for the body, usually because of the
deficiency of an enzyme needed for digestion. Lactose
intolerance, the inability to digest the sugar found in
milk, is widespread and affects up to 70% of the
world’s adult population.

Description
Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy
and, along with fats and proteins, one of the three
major nutrients in the human diet. Carbohydrates
are classified according to their structure based on
the number of basic sugar, or saccharide units they
contain.
A monosaccharide is the simplest carbohydrate
and called a simple sugar. Simple sugars include
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Digestion of food begins in the mouth, moves on
to the stomach, and then into the small intestine.
Along the way, specific enzymes are needed to process
different types of sugars. An enzyme is a substance
that acts as a catalyst to produce chemical changes
without being changed itself. The enzymes lactase,
maltase, and isomaltase (or sucrase) are needed to
break down the disaccharides; when one or more is
inadequate, the result is carbohydrate intolerance.
Types of intolerance
Carbohydrate intolerance can be primary or secondary. Primary deficiency is caused by an enzyme
defect present at birth or developed over time.
The most common is lactose intolerance. Secondary
deficiencies are caused by a disease or disorder of the
intestinal tract, and disappear when the disease is
treated. These include protein deficiency, celiac disease, and some intestinal infections.
Adult lactose intolerance is the most common of
all enzyme deficiencies, and it is estimated that 30–50
million Americans have this condition. Some racial
and ethnic populations are affected more than
others. Lactose intolerance is found in as many as
75% of African Americans, Jewish Americans,
Mexican Americans, and Native Americans, and in
90% of Asian Americans. Descendants of Northern
Europeans and some Mediterranean peoples usually
do not develop the condition. Deficiencies in enzymes
other than lactase are extremely rare.

Causes and symptoms
Enzymes play an important role in breaking down
carbohydrates into forms that can pass through the
intestine and be used by the body. Usually they are

from these herbs are applied directly to the sores. The
tannic acid in a tea bag can also help dry up the sores
when the wet tea bag is used as a compress. Taking
dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) tea or capsules may
help heal sores and also prevent future outbreaks. Since
canker sores are often brought on by stress, such stressrelieving techniques as meditation, guided imagery, and
certain acupressure exercises may help prevent canker
sores or lessen their severity.

Carbohydrate intolerance

named by adding ase to the name of the substance
they act on, so lactase is the enzyme needed to process
lactose. Cooked starch is broken down in the mouth
to a disaccharide by amylase, an enzyme in the saliva.
The disaccharides maltose, sucrose, and lactose cannot
be absorbed until they have been separated into simple
sugar molecules by their corresponding enzymes present
in the cells lining the intestinal tract. If this process is not
completed, digestion is interrupted.
Although not common, a deficiency in the enzymes
needed to digest lactose, maltose, and sucrose is sometimes present at birth. Intestinal lactase enzymes
usually decrease naturally with age, but this happens
to varying degrees. Because of the uneven distribution
of enzyme deficiency based on race and ethnic heritage,
especially in lactose intolerance, genetics are believed to
play a role in the cause of primary carbohydrate
intolerance.
Digestive diseases such as celiac disease and tropical sprue (which affect absorption in the intestine),
as well as intestinal infections and injuries, can reduce
the amount of enzymes produced. In cancer patients,
treatment with radiation therapy or chemotherapy may
affect the cells in the intestine that normally secrete
lactase, leading to intolerance.
The severity of the symptoms depends on the
extent of the enzyme deficiency, and range from a feeling of mild bloating to severe diarrhea. In the case of a
lactase deficiency, undigested milk sugar remains in the
intestine, which is then fermented by the bacteria normally present in the intestine. These bacteria produce
gas, cramping, bloating, a ‘‘gurgly’’ feeling in the abdomen, and flatulence. In a growing child, the main symptoms are diarrhea and a failure to gain weight. In an
individual with lactase deficiency, gastrointestinal distress begins about 30 minutes to two hours after eating
or drinking foods containing lactose. Food intolerances
can be confused with food allergies, since the symptoms
of nausea, cramps, bloating, and diarrhea are similar.
Sugars that aren’t broken down into one of the
simplest forms cause the body to push fluid into the
intestines, which results in watery diarrhea (osmotic
diarrhea). Diarrhea may sweep other nutrients out of
the intestine before they can be absorbed, causing
malnutrition.

Diagnosis
Carbohydrate intolerance can be diagnosed
using oral tolerance tests. The carbohydrate being
investigated is given by mouth in liquid form and
several blood levels are measured and compared to
722

normal values. This helps evaluate the individual’s
ability to digest the sugar.
To identify lactose intolerance in children and
adults, the hydrogen breath test is used to measure
the amount of hydrogen in the breath. The patient
drinks a beverage containing lactose and the breath
is analyzed at regular intervals. If undigested lactose in
the large intestine (colon) is fermented by bacteria,
various gases are produced. Hydrogen is absorbed
from the intestines and carried by the bloodstream
into the lungs where it is exhaled. Normally there is
very little hydrogen detectable in the breath, so its
presence indicates faulty digestion of lactose.
When lactose intolerance is suspected in infants
and young children, many pediatricians recommend
simply changing from cow’s milk to soy formula and
watching for improvement. If needed, a stool sample
can be tested for acidity. The inadequate digestion of
lactose will result in an increase of acid in the waste
matter excreted by the bowels and the presence of
glucose.

Treatment
Carbohydrate intolerance caused by temporary
intestinal diseases disappears when the condition is
successfully treated. In primary conditions, no treatment exists to improve the body’s ability to produce
the enzymes, but symptoms can be controlled by diet.
Because the degree of lactose intolerance varies so
much, treatment should be tailored for the individual.
Young children showing signs of intolerance should
avoid milk products; infants should switch to soybased formula. Older children and adults can adjust
their intake of lactose depending on how much and
what they can tolerate. For some, a small glass of milk
will not cause problems, while others may be able to
handle ice cream or aged cheeses such as cheddar or
Swiss, but not other dairy products. Generally, small
amounts of lactose-containing foods taken throughout the day are better tolerated than a large amount
consumed all at once.
For those individuals who are sensitive to even very
small amounts of lactose, the lactase enzyme is available
without a prescription. It comes in liquid form for use
with milk. The addition of a few drops to a quart of milk
will reduce the lactose content by 70% after 24 hours
in the refrigerator. Heating the milk speeds up the
process, and doubling the amount of lactase liquid will
result in milk that is 90% lactose free. Chewable lactase
enzyme tablets are also available. Three to six tablets
taken before a meal or snack will aid in the digestion of

I Carbon monoxide poisoning
Definition
Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning occurs when
carbon monoxide gas is inhaled. CO is a colorless,
odorless, highly poisonous gas that is produced by
incomplete combustion. It is found in automobile
exhaust fumes, faulty stoves and heating systems,
fires, and cigarette smoke. Other sources include
woodburning stoves, kerosene heaters, improperly
ventilated water heaters and gas stoves, and blocked
or poorly maintained chimney flues. CO interferes
with the ability of the blood to carry oxygen. The
result is headache, nausea, convulsions, and finally
death by asphyxiation.

Description
Carbon monoxide, sometimes called coal gas, has
been known as a toxic substance since the third century
B.C. It was used for executions and suicides in early
Rome. Today it is the leading cause of accidental poisoning in the United States. According to the Journal of
the American Medical Association, 2,000 Americans die
each year from accidental exposure to CO, and another
2,300 from intentional exposure (suicide). An additional 10,000 people seek medical attention after exposure to CO. The Consumer Products Safety Commission
eported in 2004 that about 64% of unintentional CO
poisoning deaths occur in the home.
Anyone who is exposed to CO will become sick,
and the entire body is involved in CO poisoning.
A developing fetus can also be poisoned if a pregnant
woman breathes CO gas. Infants, people with heart or
lung disease, or those with anemia may be more seriously affected. People such as underground parking
garage attendants who are exposed to car exhausts in a
confined area are more likely to be poisoned by CO.
Firemen also run a higher risk of inhaling CO.

Causes and symptoms

Since the cause of the enzyme deficiency leading to
carbohydrate intolerance is unknown, there is no way
to prevent this condition.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Normally when a person breathes fresh air into
the lungs, the oxygen in the air binds with a molecule
called hemoglobin (Hb) that is found in red blood
cells. This allows oxygen to be moved from the lungs
to every part of the body. When the oxygen/hemoglobin complex reaches a muscle where it is needed, the
oxygen is released. Because the oxygen binding process is reversible, hemoglobin can be used over and
over again to pick up oxygen and move it throughout
the body.
723

Carbon monoxide poisoning

KEY TERMS

Carbon monoxide poisoning

Inhaling carbon monoxide gas interferes with this
oxygen transport system. In the lungs, CO competes
with oxygen to bind with the hemoglobin molecule.
Hemoglobin prefers CO to oxygen and accepts it more
than 200 times more readily than it accepts oxygen.
Not only does the hemoglobin prefer CO, it holds on
to the CO much more tightly, forming a complex
called carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). As a person
breathes CO contaminated air, more and more oxygen
transportation sites on the hemoglobin molecules
become blocked by CO. Gradually, there are fewer
and fewer sites available for oxygen. All cells need
oxygen to live. When they don’t get enough oxygen,
cellular metabolism is disrupted and eventually cells
begin to die.
The symptoms of CO poisoning and the speed
with which they appear depend on the concentration
of CO in the air and the rate and efficiency with which
a person breathes. Heavy smokers can start off
with up to 9% of their hemoglobin already bound to
CO, which they regularly inhale in cigarette smoke.
This makes them much more susceptible to environmental CO. The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) has established a maximum
permissible exposure level of 50 parts per million
(ppm) over eight hours.
With exposure to 200 ppm for two to three hours,
a person begins to experience headache, fatigue, nausea, and dizziness. These symptoms correspond to
15–25% COHb in the blood. When the concentration
of COHb reaches 50% or more, death results in a very
short time. Emergency room physicians have the most
experience diagnosing and treating CO poisoning.
The symptoms of CO poisoning in order of
increasing severity include:


headache



shortness of breath



dizziness



fatigue



mental confusion and difficulty thinking



loss of fine hand-eye coordination



nausea and vomiting



rapid heart rate



hallucinations



inability to execute voluntary movements accurately



collapse



lowered body temperature (hypothermia)



coma

724



convulsions



seriously low blood pressure



cardiac and respiratory failure



death

In some cases, the skin, mucous membranes, and
nails of a person with CO poisoning are cherry red or
bright pink. Because the color change doesn’t always
occur, it is an unreliable symptom to rely on for
diagnosis.
Although most CO poisoning is acute, or sudden,
it is possible to suffer from chronic CO poisoning. This
condition exists when a person is exposed to low levels
of the gas over a period of days to months. Symptoms
are often vague and include (in order of frequency)
fatigue, headache, dizziness, sleep disturbances, cardiac symptoms, apathy, nausea, and memory disturbances. Little is known about chronic CO poisoning,
and it is often misdiagnosed.

Diagnosis
The main reason to suspect CO poisoning is evidence that fuel is being burned in a confined area, for
example a car running inside a closed garage, a charcoal grill burning indoors, or an unvented kerosene
heater in a workshop. Under these circumstances, one
or more persons suffering from the symptoms listed
above strongly suggests CO poisoning. In the absence
of some concrete reason to suspect CO poisoning, the
disorder is often misdiagnosed as migraine headache,
stroke, psychiatric illness, food poisoning, alcohol poisoning, or heart disease.
Concrete confirmation of CO poisoning comes
from a carboxyhemoglobin test. This blood test measures the amount of CO that is bound to hemoglobin
in the body. Blood is drawn as soon after suspected
exposure to CO as possible.
Other tests that are useful in determining the
extent of CO poisoning include measurement of
other arterial blood gases and pH; a complete blood
count; measurement of other blood components such
as sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, urea nitrogen,
and lactic acid; an electrocardiogram (ECG); and a
chest x ray.

Treatment
Immediate treatment for CO poisoning is to
remove the victim from the source of carbon monoxide gas and get him or her into fresh air. If the
victim is not breathing and has no pulse, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be started.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Carboxyhemoglobin (COHb)—Hemoglobin that is
bound to carbon monoxide instead of oxygen.
Hemoglobin (Hb)—A molecule that normally
binds to oxygen in order to carry it to our cells,
where it is required for life.
Hypothermia—Development of a subnormal body
temperature.
pH—A measurement of the acidity or alkalinity of
a fluid. A neutral fluid, neither acid nor alkali, has a
pH of 7.

Depending on the severity of the poisoning, 100%
oxygen may be given with a tight fitting mask as soon
as it is available.
Taken with other symptoms of CO poisoning,
COHb levels of over 25% in healthy individuals,
over 15% in patients with a history of heart or lung
disease, and over 10% in pregnant women usually
indicate the need for hospitalization. In the hospital,
fluids and electrolytes are given to correct any imbalances that have arisen from the breakdown of cellular
metabolism.
In severe cases of CO poisoning, patients are given
hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This treatment involves
placing the patient in a chamber breathing 100% oxygen at a pressure of more than one atmosphere (the
normal pressure the atmosphere exerts at sea level).
The increased pressure forces more oxygen into the
blood. Hyperbaric facilities are specialized, and are
usually available only at larger hospitals.

Prognosis
The speed and degree of recovery from CO poisoning depends on the length and duration of exposure to the gas. The half-life of CO in normal room air
is four to five hours. This means that, in four to five
hours, half of the CO bound to hemoglobin will
be replaced with oxygen. At normal atmospheric pressures, but breathing 100% oxygen, the half-life for the
elimination of CO from the body is 50–70 minutes. In
hyperbaric therapy at three atmospheres of pressure,
the half-life is reduced to 20–25 minutes.
Although the symptoms of CO poisoning may
subside in a few hours, some patients show memory
problems, fatigue, confusion, and mood changes for
two to four weeks after their exposure to the gas.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Prevention
Carbon monoxide poisoning is preventable.
Particular care should be paid to situations where
fuel is burned in a confined area. Portable and permanently installed carbon monoxide detectors that sound
a warning similar to smoke detectors are available for
less than $50. Specific actions that will prevent CO
poisoning include:


stopping smoking. Smokers have less tolerance to
environmental CO



having heating systems and appliances installed by a
qualified contractor to assure that they are properly
vented and meet local building codes



inspecting and properly maintaining
systems, chimneys, and appliances

not using a gas oven or stove to heat the home



not burning charcoal indoors

making sure there is good ventilation if using a
kerosene heater indoors

The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test is a
laboratory blood study. CEA is a substance which is

normally found only during fetal development, but may
reappear in adults who develop certain types of cancer.

Purpose
The CEA test is ordered for patients with known
cancers. The CEA test is most commonly ordered
when a patient has a cancer of the gastrointestinal
system. These include cancer of the colon, rectum,
stomach (gastric cancer), esophagus, liver, or pancreas. It is also used with cancers of the breast, lung,
or prostate.
The CEA level in the blood is one of the factors
that doctors consider when determining the prognosis,
or most likely outcome of a cancer. In general, a higher
CEA level predicts a more severe disease, one that is
less likely to be curable. But it does not give clear-cut
information. The results of a CEA test are usually
considered along with other laboratory and/or imaging studies to follow the course of the disease.
Once treatment for the cancer has begun, CEA
tests have a valuable role in monitoring the patient’s
progress. A decreasing CEA level means therapy is
effective in fighting the cancer. A stable or increasing
CEA level may mean the treatment is not working,
and/or that the tumor is growing. It is important to
understand that serial CEA measurements, which
means several done over a period of time, are the
most useful. A single test result is difficult to evaluate,
but a number of tests, done weeks apart, shows trends
in disease progression or regression.
Certain types of cancer treatments, such as hormone therapy for breast cancer, may actually cause the
CEA level to go up. This elevation does not accurately
reflect the state of the disease. It is sometimes referred
to as a ‘‘flare response.’’ Recognition that a rise in
CEA may be temporary and due to therapy is significant. If this possibility is not taken into account, the
patient may be unnecessarily discouraged. Further,
treatment that is actually effective may be stopped or
changed prematurely.
CEA tests are also used to help detect recurrence of
a cancer after surgery and/or other treatment has been
completed. A rising CEA level may be the first sign of
cancer return, and may show up months before other
studies or patient symptoms would raise concern.
Unfortunately, this does not always mean the recurrent
cancer can be cured. For example, only a small percentage of patients with colorectal cancers and rising CEA
levels will benefit from another surgical exploration.
Those with recurrence in the same area as the original
cancer, or with a single metastatic tumor in the liver
726

or lung, have a chance that surgery will eliminate
the disease. Patients with more widespread return of
the cancer are generally not treatable with surgery. The
CEA test will not separate the two groups.
Patients who are most likely to benefit from non–
standard treatments, such as bone marrow transplants, may be determined on the basis of CEA values,
combined with other test results. CEA levels may be
one of the criteria for determining whether the patient
will benefit from more expensive studies, such as CT
scan or MRI.

Precautions
The CEA test is not a screening test for cancer.
It is not useful for detecting the presence of cancer.
Many cancers do not produce an increased CEA
level. Some noncancerous diseases, such as hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, and
obstructive pulmonary disease, may cause an elevated
CEA level.

Description
Determination of the CEA level is a laboratory
blood test. Obtaining a specimen of blood for the
study takes only a few minutes. CEA testing should
be covered by most insurance plans.

Preparation
No preparation is required.

Aftercare
None.

Risks
There are no complications or side effects of this
test. However, the results of a CEA study should be
interpreted with caution. A single test result may not
yield clinically useful information. Several studies over
a period of months may be needed.
Another concern is the potential for false positive
as well as false negative results. A false positive result
means the test shows an abnormal value when cancer
is not present. A false negative means the test reveals a
normal value when cancer actually is present.

Normal results
The absolute numbers which are considered normal vary from one laboratory to another. Any results
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Abnormal results
A single abnormal CEA value may be significant,
but must be regarded cautiously. In general, very high
CEA levels indicate more serious cancer, with a poorer
chance for cure. But some benign diseases and certain
cancer treatments may produce an elevated CEA test.
Cigarette smoking will also cause the CEA level to be
abnormally high.

Description
A cardiac blood pool scan is sometimes called
equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography or gated
(synchronized) cardiac blood pool imaging. A multiplegated acquisition (MUGA) scan is a variation of
this test.
To perform a cardiac blood pool scan, the patient
lies under a special gamma scintillation camera that
detects radiation. A protein tagged with a radioactive
marker (usually technetium-99m) is injected into the
patient’s forearm.
The camera is synchronized with an electrocardiogram (ECG) to take a picture at specific times in the
cycle of heart contraction and relaxation. When data
from many sequential pictures is processed by a computer, a doctor can analyze whether the left ventricle is
functioning normally.
The patient needs to remain silent and motionless
during the test. Sometimes the patient is asked to
exercise, then another set of pictures is taken for
comparison. This test normally takes about 30
minutes.

Preparation
No changes in diet or medication are necessary.
An ECG will probably be done before the test.

I Cardiac blood pool scan
Definition
A cardiac blood pool scan is a non-invasive test
that uses a mildly radioactive marker to observe the
functioning of the left ventricle of the heart.

Purpose
The left ventricle is the main pump for distributing
blood through the body. A cardiac blood pool scan is
used to determine how efficiently the left ventricle is
working. The scan can detect aneurysms of the left
ventricle, motion abnormalities caused by damage to
the heart wall, cardiac shunts between the left and
right ventricle, and coronary occlusive artery disease.

Precautions
Pregnant women are the only patients who should
not participate in a cardiac blood pool scan. However,
the accuracy of the results may be affected if the
patient moves during imaging, has had other recent
nuclear scans, or has an irregular heartbeat.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Aftercare
The patient may resume normal activities
immediately.

Risks
Cardiac blood pool scans are a safe and effective
way of measuring left ventricle function. The only risk
is to the fetus of a pregnant woman.

Normal results
A computer is used to process the information
from the test, then the results are analyzed by a doctor.
A normally functioning left ventricle will contract
symmetrically, show even distribution of the radioactively tagged protein, and eject about 55–65% of
volume of blood it holds on each contraction.

Abnormal results
Patients with damage to the ventricle or heart
wall will show an uneven distribution of the

I Cardiac catheterization
Definition
Cardiac catheterization (also called heart catheterization) is a diagnostic procedure which does a comprehensive examination of how the heart and its blood
vessels function. One or more catheters is inserted
through a peripheral blood vessel in the arm (antecubital artery or vein) or leg (femoral artery or vein) with
x–ray guidance. This procedure gathers information
such as adequacy of blood supply through the coronary
arteries, blood pressures, blood flow throughout chambers of the heart, collection of blood samples, and x rays
of the heart’s ventricles or arteries.
A test that can be performed on either side of the
heart, cardiac catheterization checks for different
functions in both the left and right sides. When testing
728

Typically performed along with angiography, a
technique of injecting a dye into the vascular system
to outline the heart and blood vessels, a catheterization can aid in the visualization of any blockages,
narrowing, or abnormalities in the coronary arteries.
If these signs are visible, the cardiologist may assess
the patient’s need and readiness for coronary bypass
surgery, or perhaps a less invasive approach, such as
dilation of a narrowed blood vessel either surgically or
with the use of a balloon (angioplasty).
When looking at the left side of the heart, fluoroscopic guidance also allows the following diagnoses to
be assessed:


enlargement of the left ventricle



ventricular aneurysms (abnormal dilation of a blood
vessel)



narrowing of the aortic valve



insufficiency of the aortic or mitral valve



the detour of blood from one side of the heart to the
other due to septal defects (also known as shunting)
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Cardiac catheterization is categorized as an ‘‘invasive’’ procedure which involves the heart, its valves,
and coronary arteries, in addition to a large artery in
the arm or leg. Due to the nature of the test, it is
important to evaluate for the following conditions
before considering this procedure:




A diagnosis of a bleeding disorder, poor kidney function, or debilitation. Any of these pre-existing conditions typically raises the risk of the catheterization
procedure and may be reason to cancel the
procedure.
A diagnosis of heart valve disease. If this is detected,
antibiotics may be given before the test to prevent
inflammation of the membrane which lines the heart
(endocarditis).

Description
To understand how a cardiac catheterization is
able to diagnose and manage heart disease, the basic
workings of the heart muscle must also be understood.
Just as the body relies on a constant supply of blood to
aid in its everyday functions, so does the heart. The
heart is made up of an intricate web of blood vessels
(coronary arteries) that ensure an adequate supply of
blood rich in oxygen and nutrients. It is easy to see
how an abnormality in any of these arteries can be
detrimental to the heart’s function. These abnormalities cause the heart’s blood flow to decrease and result
in the condition known as coronary artery disease or
coronary insufficiency.
Catheterization is a valuable tool in detecting and
treating abnormalities of the heart. Through the use of
fluoroscopic (x ray) guidance, a catheter, which may
resemble a balloon-tipped tube, is strung through the
veins or arteries into the heart, so the cardiologist can
monitor a body’s various functions at each moment.
Generally a test that lasts two to three hours, a
patient should expect the following prior to and during the catheterization procedure:


A mild sedative may be given that will allow the
patient to relax but remain conscious during the test.



An intravenous needle will be inserted in the arm to
administer medication. Electrodes will be attached to
the chest to enable the painless procedure known as
an electrocardiograph.



Prior to inserting a catheter into an artery or vein in
the arm or leg, the incision site will be made numb by
injecting a local anesthetic. When the anesthetic is
injected it may feel like a pin-prick followed by a

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

quick stinging sensation. Pressure may also be
experienced as the catheter travels through the
blood vessel.


After the catheter is guided into the coronary-artery
system, a dye (also called a radiocontrast material) is
injected to aid in the identification of any abnormalities
of the heart. During this time, the patient may experience a hot, flushed feeling or a quickly passing nausea.
Coughing or breathing deeply aids in any discomfort.



Medication may be given during the procedure if
chest pain is experienced, and nitroglycerin may
also be administered to allow expansion of the
heart’s blood vessels.



When the test is complete, the physician will remove
the catheter and close the skin with several sutures or
tape.

Preparation
Prior to the cardiac catheterization procedure, it is
important to relay information to the physician or
nurse regarding allergies to shellfish (such as shrimp
or scallops) which contain iodine, iodine itself, or the
dyes that are commonly used in other diagnostic tests.
Because this procedure is categorized as a surgery,
the patient will be instructed not to eat or drink anything for at least six hours prior to the test. Just before
the test begins, the patient will urinate and change into
a hospital gown, then lie flat on a padded table that
may also be tilted in order for the heart to be examined
from a variety of angles.

Aftercare
While cardiac catheterization may be performed
on an out-patient basis, a patient may require close
monitoring following the procedure while remaining
in the hospital for at least 24 hours. The patient will
be instructed to rest in bed for at least eight hours
immediately after the test. If the catheter was inserted
into a vein or artery in the leg or groin area, the leg will
be kept extended for four to six hours. If a vein or artery
in the arm was used to insert the catheter, the arm will
need to remain extended for a minimum of three hours.
The patient should expect a hard ridge to form over
the incision site that diminishes as the site heals. Bluish
discoloration under the skin at the point of insertion
should also be expected but fades in two weeks. It is also
not uncommon for the incision site to bleed during the
first 24 hours following surgery. If this should happen,
the patient should apply pressure to the site with a clean
tissue or cloth for 10–15 minutes.

or configuration, wall motion or thickness, the direction of blood flow, or motion of the valves. Smooth
and regular outlines on the x ray indicate normal
coronary arteries.

Risks
Similar to all surgical procedures, the cardiac catheterization test does involve some risks. Complications
that may occur during the procedure include


cardiac arrhythmias (an irregular heart beat)



pericardial tamponade (a condition that causes
excess pressure in the pericardium which affects the
heart due to accumulation of excess fluid)



the rare occurrence of myocardial infarction (heart
attack) or stroke may also develop due to clotting or
plaque rupture of one or more of the coronary or
brain arteries.

An essential part of the catheterization is measuring intracardiac pressures, or the pressure in the
heart’s chambers and vessels. Pressure readings that
are higher than normal are significant for a patient’s
overall diagnosis. The pressure readings that are
lower, other than those which are produced as a result
of shock, typically are not significant.
An ejection fraction, or a comparison of how
much blood is ejected from the heart’s left ventricle
during its contraction phase with a measurement of
blood remaining at the end of the left ventricle’s
relaxation phase, is also determined by performing a
catheterization. The cardiologist will look for a normal ejection fraction reading of 60–70%.

Abnormal results
Cardiac catheterization provides valuable still and
motion x-ray pictures of the coronary arteries that
help in diagnosing coronary artery disease, poor
heart function, disease of the heart valves, and septal
defects (a defect in the septum, the wall that separates
two heart chambers).
The most prominent sign of coronary artery disease is the narrowing or blockage in the coronary
arteries, with narrowing that is greater than 70% considered significant. A clear indication for intervention
(by angioplasty or surgery) is a finding of significant
narrowing of the left main coronary artery and/or
blockage or severe narrowing in the high, left anterior
descending coronary artery.

Before left-side catheterization is performed,
the anticoagulant medication heparin may be administered. This drug helps decrease the risk of the
development of a blood clot in an artery (thrombosis)
and blood clots traveling throughout the body
(embolization).

A finding of impaired wall motion is an additional
indicator of coronary artery disease, aneurysm, an
enlarged heart, or a congenital heart problem. Using
the findings from an ejection fraction test which measures wall motion, cardiologists look at an ejection
fraction reading under 35% as increasing the risk of
complications while also decreasing a successful long
term or short term outcome with surgery.

The risks of the catheterization procedure increase
in patients over the age of 60, those who have severe
heart failure, or persons with serious valvular heart
disease.

Detecting the difference in pressure above and
below the heart valve can verify heart valve disease.
The greater narrowing correlates with the higher pressure difference.

I Cardiac rehabilitation
Definition
Cardiac rehabilitation is a comprehensive exercise,
education, and behavioral modification program
designed to improve the physical and emotional condition of patients with heart disease.

Purpose
Heart attack survivors, bypass and angioplasty
patients, and individuals with angina, congestive
heart failure, and heart transplants are all candidates
for a cardiac rehabilitation program. Cardiac rehabilitation is prescribed to control symptoms, improve
exercise tolerance, and improve the overall quality of
life in these patients.

Precautions
A cardiac rehabilitation program should be implemented and closely monitored by a trained team of
healthcare professionals.

Description
Cardiac rehabilitation is overseen by a specialized team of doctors, nurses, and other healthcare
professionals. Members of the cardiac rehabilitation
team may include a dietician or nutritionist, physical
therapist, exercise physiologist, psychologist, vocational counselor, occupational therapist, and social
worker. The program frequently begins in a hospital

setting and continues on an outpatient basis after
the patient is discharged over a period of six to 12
months.
Components of a cardiac rehabilitation program
vary by individual clinical need, and each program will
be carefully constructed for the patient by his or her
rehabilitation team.


Exercise. Exercise programs typically start out
slowly, with simple range-of-motion arm and leg
exercises. Walking and stair climbing soon follow.
Blood pressure is carefully monitored before and
after exercise sessions, and patients are taught how
to measure their heart rate and evaluate any possible
cardiac symptoms during each session. Patients
with advanced coronary disease may require continuous ECG monitoring throughout their exercise sessions. Once discharged from the hospital, the patient
works with his cardiac team to create an individual
exercise plan.



Diet. Cardiac patients will work with a nutritionist or
dietician to develop a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet
plan. Patients with high blood pressure may be put
on a salt-restricted diet and instructed to limit alcohol intake. Weight loss may also be a goal with obese
cardiac patients.



Counseling. A psychologist or social worker can help
cardiac patients with issues that may be contributing
to their heart condition, such as stress and anxiety.
Relaxation techniques may be taught to patients to
help them deal with these feelings. Cardiac patients
frequently experience a period of depression, and
group or individual counseling can be beneficial in
overcoming these feelings. Vocational counselors
can assist cardiac patients in returning to the
workforce.



Education. The patient and family should be fully
educated on the physical limitations of the patient,
his recommended diet and exercise plan, his emotional status, and the lifestyle changes required to
improve the patient’s overall health.



Smoking cessation. Cardiac patients who smoke are
twice as likely to have a heart attack in the following
five years than non-smoking patients. These patients
are strongly encouraged to enroll in a smoking cessation program, which typically includes patient
education and behavioral counseling. Nicotine replacement therapy, which uses nicotine patches, nose
spray, or gum to wean patients off of cigarettes,
may also be part of the program. Antidepressants
and anti-anxiety medication may be helpful in some
cases.

Aftercare
Long-term maintenance is a critical feature of
cardiac rehabilitation. Patients require support from
their healthcare team, family, and friends to continue
the lifestyle changes they implemented during the
rehabilitation period.

Risks
The risks of another heart attack during cardiac
rehabilitation are slight, and greatly reduced by careful, continuous monitoring of the physical status of
the patient.

Normal results
The outcome of the cardiac rehabilitation program
depends on a number of variables, including patient

the pericardium is damaged by cancer. Blunt or penetrating injury from trauma to the chest or heart can
also result in cardiac tamponade when large amounts
of blood fill the pericardium. Tamponade can also
occur during heart surgery.
When the heart is compressed by the surrounding
fluid, three conditions occur: a reduced amount of blood
is pumped to the body by the heart, the lower chambers
of the ventricles are filled with a less than normal
amount of blood, and higher than normal blood pressures occur inside the heart, caused by the pressure of the
fluid pushing in on the heart from the outside.
When tamponade occurs because of trauma, the
sound of the heart beats can become faint, and
the blood pressure in the arteries decreases, while the
blood pressure in the veins increases.
In cases of tamponade caused by more slowly
developing diseases, shortness of breath, a feeling of
tightness in the chest, increased blood pressure in the
large veins in the neck (the jugular veins), weight gain,
and fluid retention by the body can occur.

Diagnosis

I Cardiac tamponade
Definition
Cardiac tamponade occurs when the heart is
squeezed by fluid that collects inside the sac that surrounds it.

Description
The heart is surrounded by a sac called the pericardium. When this sac becomes filled with fluid, the
liquid presses on the heart, preventing the lower chambers of the heart from properly filling with blood.
Because the lower chambers (the ventricles) cannot fill with the correct amount of blood, less than
normal amounts of blood reach the lungs and the rest
of the body. This condition is very serious and can be
fatal if not treated.

Causes and symptoms
Fluid can collect inside the pericardium and compress the heart when the kidneys do not properly
remove waste from the blood, when the pericardium
swells from unknown causes, from infection, or when
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

When cardiac tamponade is suspected, accurate
diagnosis can be life-saving. The most accurate way to
identify this condition is by using a test called an
echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to create
an image of the heart and its surrounding sac, making
it easy to visualize any fluid that has collected inside
the sac.

Treatment
If the abnormal fluid buildup in the pericardial
sac is caused by cancer or kidney disease, drugs used
to treat these conditions can help lessen the amount
of fluid collecting inside the sac. Drugs that help
maintain normal blood pressure throughout the
body can also help this condition; however, these
drugs are only a temporary treatment. The fluid
within the pericardium must be drained out to reduce
the pressure on the heart and restore proper heart
pumping.
The fluid inside the pericardium is drained by
inserting a needle through the chest and into the sac
itself. This allows the fluid to flow out of the sac,
relieving the abnormal pressure on the heart. This
procedure is called pericardiocentesis. In severe cases,
a tube (catheter) can be inserted into the sac or a
section of the sac can be surgically cut away to allow
for more drainage.

elderly persons, but can also affect infants, children,
and adolescents.
There are four major types of cardiomyopathy:


Dilated (congestive cardiomyopathy). This is the most
common form of the disease. The heart cavity is
enlarged and stretched (cardiac dilation), which
results in weak and slow pumping of the blood,
which in turn can result in the formation of blood
clots. Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) and
disturbances in the electrical conduction processes
in the heart may also occur. Most patients with this
type of cardiomyopathy develop congestive heart
failure. There is also a genetically-linked cardiac disease, Barth syndrome, that can cause dilated cardiomyopathy. This syndrome affects male children, and
is usually diagnosed at birth or within the first few
months of life. Pregnant women during the last trimester of pregnancy or after childbirth may develop a
type of dilated cardiomyopathy referred to as peripartum cardiomyopathy.



Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. With this type of cardiomyopathy, the muscle mass of the left ventricle
enlarges, or hypertrophies. In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), the septum (wall)
between the two heart ventricles (the pumping chambers) becomes enlarged and obstructs blood flow from
the left ventricle. The thickened wall can also distort
one leaflet of the mitral valve, which results in
leakage. HOCM is most common in young adults.
HOCM is often hereditary, caused by genetic mutations in the affected person’s DNA. The disease is
either inherited through one parent who is a carrier
or through both parents who each contribute a defective gene. HOCM is also referred to as asymmetrical
septal hypertrophy (ASH) or idiopathic hypertrophic
subaortic stenosis (IHSS). In another form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, non-obstructive cardiomyopathy, the enlarged heart muscle does not obstruct the
blood flow through the heart.



Restrictive cardiomyopathy. This is a less common
type of cardiomyopathy, in which the heart muscle
of the ventricles becomes rigid. Restrictive cardiomyopathy affects the diastolic function of the heart,
that is, it affects the period when the heart is relaxing
between contractions. Since the heart cannot relax
adequately between contractions, it is harder for the
ventricles to fill with blood between heartbeats. This
type of cardiomyopathy is usually the result of
another disease.



Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
(ARVC). ARVC is very rare and is believed to be
an inherited condition. With ARVC, heart muscle

Prognosis
This condition is life-threatening. However, drug
treatments can be helpful, and surgical treatments can
successfully drain the trapped fluid, though it may
reaccumulate. Some risk of death exists with surgical
drainage of the accumulated fluid.

I Cardiomyopathy
Definition
Cardiomyopathy is a chronic disease of the heart
muscle (myocardium), in which the muscle is abnormally enlarged, thickened, and/or stiffened. The weakened heart muscle loses the ability to pump blood
effectively, resulting in irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias) and possibly even heart failure.

Description
Cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle,
primarily affects the left ventricle, which is the main
pumping chamber of the heart. The disease is often
associated with inadequate heart pumping and other
heart function abnormalities. Cardiomyopathy is not
common (affecting about 50,000 persons in the United
States) but it can be severely disabling or fatal. Severe
cases may result in heart failure and will require a heart
transplant for patient survival. Cardiomyopathy is a
heart condition that not only affects middle-aged and
734

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Causes & symptoms
Cardiomyopathy may be caused by many different factors, including viral infections (e.g., myocarditis), heart attacks, alcoholism, long-term, severe high
blood pressure, genetic neuromuscular diseases (e.g.,
muscular dystrophies and ataxias), genetic metabolic
disorders, complications from AIDS, and other reasons that have not yet been identified (idiopathic
cardiomyopathy). Cardiomyopathy caused by heart
attacks (referred to as ischemic cardiomyopathy)
results from scarring in the heart muscle. Larger
scars or more numerous heart attacks increases the
risk that ischemic cardiomyopathy will develop.
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy usually develops about 10
years after sustained, heavy alcohol consumption.
Other toxins that may cause cardiomyopathy include
drugs and radiation exposure.
The major symptoms of cardiomyopathy include:


shortness of breath



temporary and brief loss of consciousness, especially
after engaging in activity



lightheadness, especially after engaging in activity



decreased ability to tolerate physical exertion

palpitations, that is, the sensation of feeling the heart
beat



chest pain (angina), whereby there is a feeling of
sharp and unrelenting pressure in the middle of the
chest (especially experienced by persons whose cardiomyopathy is a result of a previous heart attack)



high blood pressure

Other symptoms that may be associated with
cardiomyopathy include:

Diagnosis
A complete physical examination and health history review by a health care provider is recommended
if a person is suspected to have cardiomyopathy. The
examination may reveal the presence of an irregular
heartbeat, heart murmur, or other abnormal heart and
breath sounds.
Various invasive and non-invasive tests are performed as diagnostic tools for cardiomyopathy. An
echocardiogram is the most informative noninvasive
test for diagnosing the type of cardiomyopathy and
the degree of dysfunction in the heart muscle. High
frequency sound waves produce moving images of the
beating heart on a video screen, which allows the
measurement of muscle thickness, size, pumping ability, degree of obstruction, chamber size, and heart
valve movement.
The use of non-invasive radiation-based imaging
procedures, such as chest radiography, computed
tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) procedures show the size, shape, and structure
of the heart. If dilated cardiomyopathy is suspected,
one of these techniques is performed first to see if the
heart is enlarged and whether there is any fluid accumulation in the lungs.
An electrocardiogram (EKG) is a non-invasive
procedure where electrodes are placed on the person’s
limbs and chest wall to provide a graphic record of the
electrical activity of the heart. This test can show the
amount of heart enlargement and reveal abnormal
heart rhythms. Children with a normal echocardiogram may have an abnormal EKG, indicating that
they may be a carrier of the cardiomyopathy gene
and may develop the disease later in life. A person
may also wear a Holter monitor, which is an external
device that continuously records heart rhythms. The
monitor can identify irregular heart rhythms associated with dilated, hypertrophic, or restrictive
cardiomyopathy.
Genetic studies may help in understanding the
cause of cardiomyopathy, since the disease may be a
symptom of another genetic disorder. If a child under
the age of 4 has cardiomyopathy, metabolic screening
should be performed, for certain metabolic disorders
with cardiomyopathy as a symptom can be controlled
with a change in diet, drug therapy, or by a bone marrow transplant, which may reduce or reverse the progression of the cardiomyopathy. Since cardiomyopathy

cells become disorganized and damaged and are
replaced by fatty tissues. The damage appears to be
a result of the body’s inability to remove damaged
cells. The damaged cells are replaced with fat, leading
to abnormal electrical activity (arrhythmias) and
abnormal heart contractions. ARVC is the most
common cause of sudden death in athletes.

relieve venous congestion. These drugs may result in
side effects, so the patient must be carefully monitored
to prevent complications.

Invasive procedures, which involve the use of
anesthesia, are used to determine the severity of the disease. In the radionuclide ventriculogram procedure, a
low-dose radioactive material is injected into a vein and
flows to the heart. The heart is photographed with a
special camera to assess the contraction and filling of
the ventricles at rest and with activity. Cardiac catheterization involves insertion of thin, flexible plastic tubes
(catheters) into the heart from a blood vessel in the
groin area. A dye is then injected that can indicate
blood pressures, blood flow within the heart, and
blockages in the arteries. Although rarely used, a heart
muscle biopsy, where the doctor removes a few, tiny
pieces of the heart for laboratory studies, can aid in
diagnosing possible infections in the heart or metabolic
abnormalities. An electrophysiology study is similar to
heart catheterization. Catheters with fine wires are
inserted through veins in the groin area into the heart.
Electrical stimuli applied through the wires can indicate
abnormal conduction pathways, arrhythmias, effectiveness of drugs, and the need for an implanted defibrillator.

When drugs are not effective or when arrhythmias
require regulation, a pacemaker or a defibrillator may
be implanted surgically into the patient. The procedures for implanting both devices involves placing a
small mechanical device under the skin of the chest or
abdomen with wire leads threaded through veins to
the heart. A pacemaker is used to monitor and stabilize slow heartbeats, while a defibrillator (‘‘an emergency room in the heart’’) detects and treats fast and
potentially lethal heart rhythms. Since sudden death
may occur in patients with cardiomyopathy, defibrillators are often recommended for persons who show
evidence of arrhythmias.

Treatment
Although there is a long list of possible causes for
cardiomyopathy, few are directly treatable or curable.
Therefore, most therapy is directed towards treating
the effects of the disease on the heart. If cardiomyopathy is diagnosed at an advanced stage, a critically ill
patient will require immediate life-saving measures
such as placement of a breathing tube and administration of medicines to improve heart function and blood
pressure. Once the patient is stabilized, long-term therapy needs, such as oral medication, pacemakers, surgery, or heart transplantation, will be identified.
Initial treatments for cardiomyopathy for patients
diagnosed in the earlier stages of cardiomyopathy
include drug therapy to relieve heart failure, to decrease
oxygen requirements and workload of the heart (by
relaxing the arteries in the body), and to regulate abnormal heartbeats. Drugs that help the heart contract
include digoxin for at-home use and dopamine, dobutamine, and milrinone for in-hospital use. Diuretics help
relieve fluid overloads in heart failure. Vasodilators,
ACE-inhibitors, and beta blockers dilate blood vessels
in the body and lower blood pressure, thus reducing the
workload for the heart. For patients at risk of developing blood clots, anticoagulation medication or blood
thinners such as heparin or coumadin are prescribed
along with diuretics such as Lasix and aldactone to
736

For heart failure symptoms associated with
restricted blood flow from the ventricles, septal myomectomy, which is considered major heart surgery, is
sometimes recommended. This procedure involves
surgical removal of the part of the thickened septal
muscle that blocks the blood flow. In some cases, the
mitral valve is replaced with an artificial valve.
However, the procedure does not prevent sudden
death due to hear arrhythmias nor does it stop the
disease from progressing.
Since cardiomyopathy often becomes progressively
worse, the heart can reach a state where it no longer
responds to medication or to surgery. The treatment of
‘‘last resort’’ is a heart transplant, when the patient
exhibits severe heart failure symptoms. A transplant
can cure the symptoms of heart failure, but the surgery
carries significant risks, such as infection, organ rejection, and side effects of required medications.
There are surgical procedures that can be implemented to sustain life until a transplant donor
becomes available. Left Ventricular Assist Device
(LVAD) provides mechanical circulatory support,
while Dynamic Cardiomyoplasty is a procedure
whereby a skeletal-muscular flap, created from a
patient’s chest muscle, is first taught to contract and
then is wrapped around the heart to aid in contraction.

Alternative treatment
Alternative treatments are directed towards control of the effects of heart disease. Exercise, diet, nutrition, herbal therapies, stress reduction, and other
life style changes (e.g., cessation of smoking) can all
be used to complement conventional treatments.
Certain herbs such as fox glove (Digitalis purpurea)
and lily of the valley (Convallaria majalis) contain

Arrhythmia—An abnormal rhythm or irregularity
of the heartbeat. The heartbeat may either be too
fast (tachycardia) or too slow (bradicardia).
Arrhythmias may cause symptoms such as palpitation or light-headedness, but many have more serious consequences, including sudden death.
Congestive heart failure—Potentially lethal condition in which congestion develops in the lungs that

Hypertrophy—Literally means an increase in the

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)

I Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR)
Definition
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a procedure to support and maintain breathing and circulation for a person who has stopped breathing
(respiratory arrest) and/or whose heart has stopped
(cardiac arrest).

Purpose
CPR is performed to restore and maintain breathing and circulation and to provide oxygen and blood
flow to the heart, brain, and other vital organs. CPR
should be performed if a person is unconscious and
not breathing. Respiratory and cardiac arrest can be
caused by allergic reactions, an ineffective heartbeat,
asphyxiation, breathing passages that are blocked,
choking, drowning, drug reactions or overdoses, electric shock, exposure to cold, severe shock, or trauma.
CPR can be performed by trained bystanders or
healthcare professionals on infants, children, and
adults. It should always be performed by the person
on the scene who is most experienced in CPR.

Precautions
CPR should never be performed on a healthy
person because it can cause serious injury to a beating
heart by interfering with normal heartbeats.

Description
CPR is part of the emergency cardiac care system
designed to save lives. Many deaths can be prevented
by prompt recognition of the problem and notification
of the emergency medical system (EMS), followed by
early CPR, defibrillation (which delivers a brief electric
shock to the heart in attempt to get the heart to
beat normally), and advanced cardiac life support
measures.
CPR must be performed within four to six minutes after cessation of breathing so as to prevent brain
damage or death. It is a two-part procedure that
involves rescue breathing and external chest compressions. To provide oxygen to a person’s lungs, the
rescuer administers mouth-to-mouth breaths, then
helps circulate blood through the heart to vital organs
by external chest compressions. Mouth-to-mouth
breathing and external chest compression should be
performed together, but if the rescuer is not strong
enough to do both, the external chest compressions
738

should be done. This is more effective than no resuscitation attempt, as is CPR that is performed ‘‘poorly.’’
When performed by a bystander, CPR is designed
to support and maintain breathing and circulation
until emergency medical personnel arrive and take
over. When performed by healthcare personnel, it is
used in conjunction with other basic and advanced life
support measures.
According to the American Heart Association,
early CPR and defibrillation combined with early
advanced emergency care can increase survival rates
for people with a type of abnormal heart beat called
ventricular fibrillation by as much as 40%. CPR by
bystanders may prolong life during deadly ventricular
fibrillation, giving emergency medical service personnel time to arrive.
However, many CPR attempts are not ultimately
successful in restoring a person to a good quality of
life. Often, there is brain damage even if the heart
starts beating again. CPR is therefore not generally
recommended for the chronically or terminally ill or
frail elderly. For these people, it represents a traumatic
and not a peaceful end of life.
Each year, CPR helps save thousands of lives in
the United States. More than five million Americans
annually receive training in CPR through American
Heart Association and American Red Cross courses.
In addition to courses taught by instructors, the
American Heart Association also has an interactive
video called Learning System, which is available at
more than 500 healthcare institutions. Both organizations teach CPR the same way, but use different terms.
These organizations recommend that family members
or other people who live with people who are at risk
for respiratory or cardiac arrest be trained in CPR. A
hand-held device called a CPR Prompt is available to
walk people trained in CPR through the procedure,
using American Heart Association guidelines. CPR
has been practiced for more than 40 years.

The basic procedure for CPR is the same for all
people, with a few modifications for infants and children
to account for their smaller size.
PERFORMING CPR ON AN ADULT. The first step is
to call the emergency medical system for help by telephoning 911; then to begin CPR, following these steps:


The rescuer opens a person’s airway by placing the
head face up, with the forehead tilted back and the
chin lifted. The rescuer checks again for breathing
(three to five seconds), then begins rescue breathing
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



After two breaths, the rescuer checks the unconscious person’s pulse by moving the hand that was
under the person’s chin to the artery in the neck
(carotid artery). If the unconscious person has a
heartbeat, the rescuer continues rescue breathing
until help arrives or the person begins breathing
without assistance. If the unconscious person is
breathing, the rescuer turns the person onto his or
her side.



If there is no heartbeat, the rescuer performs chest
compressions. The rescuer kneels next to the unconscious person, placing the heel of one hand in the
spot on the lower chest where the two halves of the
rib cage come together. The rescuer puts one hand on
top of the other on the person’s chest and interlocks
the fingers. The arms are straightened, the rescuer’s
shoulders are positioned directly above the hands on
the unconscious person’s chest. The hands are
pressed down, using only the palms, so that the
person’s breastbone sinks in about 1½–2 inches.
The rescuer releases pressure without removing the
hands, then repeats about 15 times per 10–15 second
intervals.



The rescuer tilts the unconscious person’s head and
returns to rescue breathing for one or two quick
breaths. Then breathing and chest compressions are
alternated for one minute before checking for a
pulse. If the rescuer finds signs of a heartbeat and
breathing, CPR is stopped. If the unconscious person
is breathing but has no pulse, the chest compressions
are continued. If the unconscious person has a pulse
but is not breathing, rescue breathing is continued.



For children over the age of eight, the rescuer performs CPR exactly as for an adult.

PERFORMING CPR ON AN INFANT OR CHILD UNDER
THE AGE OF EIGHT. The procedures outlined above are

followed with these differences:


The rescuer administers CPR for one minute, then
calls for help.



The rescuer makes a seal around the child’s mouth or
infant’s nose and mouth to give gentle breaths. The
rescuer delivers 20 rescue breaths per minute, taking
1½–2 seconds for each breath.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



Chest compressions are given with only one hand for
a child and with two or three fingers for an infant.
The breastbone is depressed only 1–1½ inch for a
child and ½–1 inch for an infant, the rescuer gives at
least 100 chest compressions per minute.
New developments in CPR

Some new ways of performing CPR have been
tried. Active compression-decompression resuscitation, abdominal compression done in between chest
compressions, and chest compression using a pneumatic vest have all been tested but none are currently
recommended for routine use.
The active compression-decompression device
was developed to improve blood flow from the heart,
but clinical studies have found no significant difference in survival between standard and active compression-decompression CPR. Interposed abdominal
counterpulsation, which requires two or more rescuers, one compressing the chest and the other compressing the abdomen, was developed to improve
pressure and therefore blood flow. It has been shown
in a small study to improve survival but more data is
needed. A pneumatic vest, which circles the chest of an
unconscious person and compresses it, increases pressure within the chest during external chest compression. The vest has been shown to improve survival in a
preliminary study but more data is necessary for a full
assessment.

Preparation
If a person suddenly becomes unconscious, a rescuer should call out for help from other bystanders,
and then determine if the unconscious person is
responsive by gently shaking the shoulder and shouting a question. Upon receiving no answer, the rescuer
should call the emergency medical system. The rescuer
should check to see whether the unconscious person is
breathing by kneeling near the person’s shoulders,
looking at the person’s chest, and placing a cheek
next to the unconscious person’s mouth. The rescuer
should look for signs of breathing in the chest and
abdomen, and listen and feel for signs of breathing
through the person’s lips. If no signs of breathing are
present after three to five seconds, CPR should be
started.

Aftercare
Emergency medical care is always necessary
after successful CPR. Once a person’s breathing
and heartbeat have been restored, the rescuer should

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)

(mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration), pinching the
nostrils shut while holding the chin in the other hand.
The rescuer’s mouth is placed against the unconscious person’s mouth with the lips making a tight
seal, then gently exhales for about one to one and a
half seconds. The rescuer breaks away for a moment
and then repeats. The person’s head is repositioned
after each mouth-to-mouth breath.

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)

KEY TERMS

Cardioversion

I Cardioversion
Definition
Cardioversion refers to the process of restoring
the heart’s normal rhythm by applying a controlled
electric shock to the exterior of the chest.

Purpose
When the heart beats too fast, blood no longer
circulates effectively in the body. Cardioversion
is used to stop this abnormal beating so that the
heart can begin normal rhythm and pump more
efficiently.

KEY TERMS
Atrial fibrillation—A condition in which the upper
chamber of the heart quivers instead of pumping in
an organized way.
Atrial flutter—A rapid pulsation of the upper
chamber of the heart that interferes with normal
function.
Ventricular fibrillation—A condition in which the
lower chamber of the heart quivers instead of
pumping in an organized way.
Ventricular tachycardia—A rapid heart beat,
usually over 100 beats per minute.

Precautions
Not all unusual heart rhythms (called arrhythmias) are dangerous or fatal. Atrial fibrillation and
atrial flutter often revert to normal rhythms without
the need for cardioversion. Healthcare providers may
also try to correct the heart rhythm with medication or
recommend a lifestyle change before trying cardioversion. However, ventricular tachycardia lasting more
than 30 seconds and ventricular fibrillation require
immediate cardioversion.

Description
Elective cardioversion is usually scheduled ahead
of time. After arriving at the hospital, an intravenous
(IV) catheter will be placed in the arm and oxygen will
be given through a face mask. A short-acting general
anesthetic will be administered through the vein.
During the two or three minutes of anesthesia, the
doctor will apply two paddles to the exterior of the
chest and administer the electric shock. It may be
necessary to give the shock two or three times to
obtain normal rhythm.

Preparation
Medication to thin the blood is usually given for
at least three weeks before elective cardioversion.
Food intake should be stopped eight hours before
the procedure.

Aftercare
Medical personnel will monitor the heart rhythm
for a few hours, after which the patient is usually sent
home. It is advisable to arrange for transportation
home, because drowsiness may last several hours.
742

The doctor may prescribe anti-arrhythmic medication
to prevent the abnormal rhythm from returning.

Risks
Cardioverters have been in use for many years
and the risks are few. Those unlikely risks that
remain include those instances when the device delivers greater or lesser power than expected or when
power setting and control knobs are not set correctly.
Unfortunately, in a number of cases, the heart prefers
its abnormal rhythm and reverts to it despite
cardioversion.

Normal results
Most cardioversions are successful and, at least
for a time, restore the normal heart rhythm.

Definition
Carotid sinus massage involves rubbing the large
part of the arterial wall at the point where the common
carotid artery, located in the neck, divides into its two
main branches.

Purpose
Sinus, in this case, means an area in a blood vessel
that is bigger than the rest of the vessel. This is a
normal dilation of the vessel. Located in the neck
just below the angle of the jaw, the carotid sinus sits
above the point where the carotid artery divides into
its two main branches. Rubbing the carotid sinus stimulates an area in the artery wall that contains nerve
endings. These nerves respond to changes in blood
pressure and are capable of slowing the heart rate.
The response to this simple procedure often slows a
rapid heart rate (for example, atrial flutter or atrial
tachycardia) and can provide important diagnostic
information to the physician.

Description
The patient will be asked to lie down, with the
neck fully extended and the head turned away from the
side being massaged. While watching an electrocardiogram monitor, the doctor will gently touch the carotid
sinus. If there is no change in the heart rate on the
monitor, the pressure is applied more firmly with a
gentle rotating motion. After massaging one side of
the neck, the massage will be repeated on the other
side. Both sides of the neck are never massaged at the
same time.

KEY TERMS
Angina pectoris—Chest pain usually caused by a
lack of oxygen in the heart muscle.
Arrhythmia—Any deviation from a normal heart
beat.
Atrial fibrillation—A condition in which the upper
chamber of the heart quivers instead of pumping in
an organized way.
Atrial flutter—Rapid, inefficient contraction of the
upper chamber of the heart.
Carotid artery—One of the major arteries supplying blood to the head and neck.
Tachycardia—A rapid heart beat, usually over 100
beats per minute.

Normal results
Carotid sinus massage will slow the heart rate
during episodes of atrial flutter, fibrillation, and
some tachycardias. It has been known to stop the
arrhythmia completely. If the procedure is being
done to help diagnose angina pectoris, massaging the
carotid sinus may make the discomfort go away.

I Carpal tunnel syndrome
Definition
Carpal tunnel syndrome is a disorder caused by
compression at the wrist of the median nerve supplying the hand, causing numbness and tingling.

Risks
The physician must be sure there is no evidence of
blockage in the carotid artery before performing the
procedure. Massage in a blocked area might cause a
clot to break loose and cause a stroke.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Description
The carpal tunnel is an area in the wrist where the
bones and ligaments create a small passageway for
the median nerve. The median nerve is responsible
743

for both sensation and movement in the hand, in
particular the thumb and first three fingers. When
the median nerve is compressed, an individual’s hand
will feel as if it has ‘‘gone to sleep.’’
Women between the ages of 30 and 60 have the
highest rates of carpal tunnel syndrome. Research has
demonstrated that carpal tunnel syndrome is a very
significant cause of missed work days due to pain. In
1995, about $270 million was spent on sick days taken
for pain from repetitive motion injuries.

Carpal tunnel ligament

Median nerve

Carpal tunnel ligament (severed)

Causes and symptoms
Compression of the median nerve in the wrist can
occur during a number of different conditions, particularly those conditions which lead to changes in
fluid accumulation throughout the body. Because
the area of the wrist through which the median
nerve passes is very narrow, any swelling in the area
will lead to pressure on the median nerve. This pressure will ultimately interfere with the nerve’s ability
to function normally. Pregnancy, obesity, arthritis,
certain thyroid conditions, diabetes, and certain
pituitary abnormalities all predispose to carpal tunnel syndrome. Other conditions which increase
the risk for carpal tunnel syndrome include some
forms of arthritis and various injuries to the arm
and wrist (including fractures, sprains, and dislocations). Furthermore, activities which cause an individual to repeatedly bend the wrist inward toward the
forearm can predispose to carpal tunnel syndrome.
Certain jobs which require repeated strong wrist
motions carry a relatively high risk of carpal tunnel
syndrome. Injuries of this type are referred to as
‘‘repetitive motion’’ injuries, and are more frequent
among secretaries doing a lot of typing, people working at computer keyboards or cash registers, factory
workers, and some musicians.
Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include
numbness, burning, tingling, and a prickly pin-like
sensation over the palm surface of the hand, and
into the thumb, forefinger, middle finger, and half
of the ring finger. Some individuals notice a shooting
pain which goes from the wrist up the arm, or down
into the hand and fingers. With continued median
nerve compression, an individual may begin to
experience muscle weakness, making it difficult to
open jars and hold objects with the affected hand.
Eventually, the muscles of the hand served by the
median nerve may begin to grow noticeably smaller
(atrophy), especially the fleshy part of the thumb.
Untreated, carpal tunnel syndrome may eventually

Median nerve

The most severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome may
require surgery to decrease the compression of the median
nerve and restore its normal function. This procedure

allowing the median nerve more room and decreasing compression. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)

result in permanent weakness, loss of sensation, or
even paralysis of the thumb and fingers of the affected
hand.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is made
in part by checking to see whether the patient’s
symptoms can be brought on by holding his or her
hand in position with wrist bent for about a minute.
Wrist x rays are often taken to rule out the possibility of a tumor causing pressure on the median nerve.
A physician examining a patient suspected of having
carpal tunnel syndrome will perform a variety of
simple tests to measure muscle strength and sensation in the affected hand and arm. Further testing
might include electromyographic or nerve conduction velocity testing to determine the exact severity
of nerve damage. These tests involve stimulating the
median nerve with electricity and measuring the
resulting speed and strength of the muscle response,
as well as recording speed of nerve transmission
across the carpal tunnel.

disability in the affected hand. Most people are able to
control the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome with
splinting and anti-inflammatory agents. For those
who go on to require surgery, about 95% will have
complete cessation of symptoms.

Prevention
Prevention is generally aimed at becoming aware
of the repetitive motions which one must make which
could put the wrist into a bent position. People who
must work long hours at a computer keyboard, for
example, may need to take advantage of recent
advances in ‘‘ergonomics,’’ which try to position the
keyboard and computer components in a way that
increases efficiency and decreases stress. Early use of
a splint may also be helpful for people whose jobs
increase the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome.
Resources

Treatment
Carpal tunnel syndrome is initially treated with
splints, which support the wrist and prevent it from
flexing inward into the position which exacerbates median nerve compression. Some people get significant
relief by wearing such splints to sleep at night, while
others will need to wear the splints all day, especially if
they are performing jobs which stress the wrist.
Ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs may be prescribed to decrease pain and swelling.
When carpal tunnel syndrome is more advanced, injection of steroids into the wrist to decrease inflammation
may be necessary.
The most severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome
may require surgery to decrease the compression of the
median nerve and restore its normal function. Such a
repair involves cutting that ligament which crosses the
wrist, thus allowing the median nerve more room and
decreasing compression. This surgery is done almost
exclusively on an outpatient basis and is often performed without the patient having to be made unconscious. Careful injection of numbing medicines (local
anesthesia) or nerve blocks (the injection of anesthetics
directly into the nerve) create sufficient numbness to
allow the surgery to be performed painlessly, without
the risks associated with general anesthesia. Recovery
from this type of surgery is usually quick and without
complications.

Prognosis
Without treatment, continued pressure on the
median nerve puts an individual at risk for permanent

I Cat-scratch disease
Definition
Cat-scratch disease is an uncommon infection
that typically results from a cat’s scratch or bite.
Most sufferers experience only moderate discomfort
and find that their symptoms clear up without
any lasting harm after a few weeks or months.
Professional medical treatment is rarely needed.

Description
Cat-scratch disease (also called cat-scratch fever)
is caused by the Bartonella henselae bacterium, which
is found in cats around the world and is transmitted
from cat to cat by fleas. Researchers have discovered
that large numbers of North American cats carry
antibodies for the disease (meaning that the cats
have been infected at some point in their lives).
Some parts of North America have much higher
745

Cat-scratch disease

KEY TERMS

Cat-scratch disease

rates of cat infection than others, however. Bartonella
henselae is uncommon or absent in cold climates,
which fleas have difficulty tolerating, but prevalent
in warm, humid places such as Memphis, Tennessee,
where antibodies were found in 71% of the cats
tested. The bacterium, which remains in a cat’s
bloodstream for several months after infection,
seems to be harmless to most cats, and normally an
infected cat will not display any symptoms. Kittens
(cats less than one year old) are more likely than adult
cats to be carrying the infection.
Bartonella henselae can infect people who are
scratched or (more rarely) bitten or licked by a cat. It
cannot be passed from person to person. Although
cats are popular pets found in about 30% of
American households, human infection appears to be
rare. One study estimated that for every 100,000
Americans there are only 2.5 cases of cat-scratch disease each year (2.5/100,000). It is also unusual for
more than one family member to become ill; a
Florida investigation discovered multiple cases in
only 3.5% of the families studied. Children and teenagers appear to be the most likely victims of catscratch disease, although the possibility exists that
the disease may be more common among adults than
previously thought.

Causes and symptoms
The first sign of cat-scratch disease may be a small
blister at the site of a scratch or bite three to 10 days
after injury. The blister (which sometimes contains
pus) often looks like an insect bite and is usually
found on the hands, arms, or head. Within two
weeks of the blister’s appearance, lymph nodes near
the site of injury become swollen. Often the infected
person develops a fever or experiences fatigue or headaches. The symptoms usually disappear within a
month, although the lymph nodes may remain swollen
for several months. Hepatitis, pneumonia, and other
dangerous complications can arise, but the likelihood
of cat-scratch disease posing a serious threat to health
is very small. AIDS patients and other immunocompromised people face the greatest risk of dangerous
complications.
Occasionally, the symptoms of cat-scratch disease
take the form of what is called Parinaud’s oculoglandular syndrome. In such cases, a small sore develops
on the palpebral conjunctiva (the membrane lining
the inner eyelid), and is often accompanied by conjunctivitis (inflammation of the membrane) and swollen lymph nodes in front of the ear. Researchers
suspect that the first step in the development of
746

Parinaud’s oculoglandular syndrome occurs when
Bartonella henselae bacteria pass from a cat’s saliva
to its fur during grooming. Rubbing one’s eyes after
handling the cat then transmits the bacteria to the
conjunctiva.

Diagnosis
A family doctor should be called whenever a cat
scratch or bite fails to heal normally or is followed by a
persistent fever or other unusual symptoms such as
long-lasting bone or joint pain. The appearance of
painful and swollen lymph nodes is another reason
for consulting a doctor. When cat-scratch disease is
suspected, the doctor will ask about a history of exposure to cats and look for evidence of a cat scratch or
bite and swollen lymph nodes. A blood test for
Bartonella henselae may be ordered to confirm the
doctor’s diagnosis.

Treatment
For otherwise healthy people, rest and over-thecounter medications for reducing fever and discomfort
(such as acetaminophen) while waiting for the disease
to run its course are usually all that is necessary.
Antibiotics are prescribed in some cases, particularly
when complications occur or the lymph nodes remain
swollen and painful for more than two or three
months, but there is no agreement among doctors
about when and how they should be used. If a lymph
node becomes very swollen and painful, the family
doctor may decide to drain it.

Prognosis
Most people recover completely from a bout of
cat-scratch disease. Further attacks are rare.

Prevention
Certain common–sense precautions can be taken
to guard against the disease. Scratches and bites
should be washed immediately with soap and water,
and it is never a good idea to rub one’s eyes after
handling a cat without first washing one’s hands.
Children should be told not to play with stray cats or
make cats angry. Immunocompromised people should
avoid owning kittens, which are more likely than adult
cats to be infectious. Because cat-scratch disease is
usually not a life-threatening illness and people tend
to form strong emotional bonds with their cats, doctors do not recommend getting rid of a cat suspected of
carrying the disease.

I Cataract surgery
Definition
Cataract surgery is a procedure performed to
remove a cloudy lens from the eye; usually an intraocular lens is implanted at the same time.

Purpose
The purpose of cataract surgery is to restore clear
vision. It is indicated when cloudy vision due to cataracts has progressed to such an extent that it interferes
with normal daily activities. It is one of the most
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Precautions
Cataract surgery is not performed on both eyes at
once. To avoid risking blindness in both eyes in the
event of infection or other catastrophe, the first eye is
allowed to heal before the cataract is removed from
the second eye.
The presence of cataracts can mask additional eye
problems, such as retinal damage, that neither doctors
nor patients are aware of prior to surgery. Since such
conditions will continue to impair sight after cataract
removal if they are not identified and treated, the
eventual outcome of cataract surgery will depend on
the outcome of other problems.
In 1997 and 1998, evidence that cataract surgery
can contribute to the progression of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) was published. ARMD is
the degeneration of the central part of the retina.
Accordingly, ARMD patients with cataracts must
weigh the risks of the loss of central vision, within
four or five years, against short-term improvement.
When an ARMD patient chooses cataract surgery,
the surgeon should shield the retina against bright
light to protect it from possible light-induced damage
during surgery and install an intraocular lens capable
of absorbing ultraviolet and blue light, which seem to
do the most damage.

Description
There are two types of cataract surgery: intracapsular and extracapsular. Intracapsular surgery is the
removal of both the lens and the thin capsule that
surround the lens. This type of surgery was common
before 1980, but has since been displaced by extracapsular surgery. Removal of the capsule requires a large
incision and doesn’t allow comfortable intraocular
lens implantation. Thus, people who undergo intracapsular cataract surgery have long recovery periods
and have to wear very thick glasses.
Extracapsular cataract surgery is the removal of
the lens where the capsule is left in place. Each year in
the United States, over a million cataracts are removed
this way. Physicians and researchers continue to
improve cataract surgery methods. Research from
France in 2003 said that cataract removal and nonpenetrating glaucoma surgery can be combined in
glaucoma patients.
There are two methods for extracapsular cataract
surgery. The usual technique is phacoemulsification.

A tiny incision (about 0.12in or 3 mm long) is made
next to the cornea (the eye’s outer covering), and an
ultrasonic probe is used to break the cataract into
minute pieces, which are then removed by suction.
When the lens is too hard to be emulsified ultrasonically, the surgeon will use a different extracapsular
technique requiring a larger incision. An incision
about 0.37 in (9 mm) inches long is made, and the
whole lens (without its capsule) is removed through
the incision. Both kinds of extracapsular extraction
leave the back of the capsule intact, so a silicone or
plastic intraocular lens can be stably implanted in
about the same location as the original lens.
The surgery takes about 30–60 minutes per eye.

Preparation
Patients must have a pre-operation eye examination, which will include ultrasound analysis to make
sure the retina (the innermost layer of the eye, containing the light receptors) is intact and also to measure
eye curvature so that a lens with the proper correction
can be implanted. The patient also will have a preoperative physical examination. In addition, patients
748

start a course of antibiotic eye drops or ointment the
day before surgery.

Aftercare
Proper post-operative care is especially important after cataract surgery. Patients will need someone to drive them home after the surgery and should
not bend over or do anything strenuous for about two
weeks. They should refrain from rubbing the eye,
should wear glasses to protect their eye, and should
wear a shield while sleeping so the eye won’t be
rubbed or bumped accidentally. The patient will
usually continue their antibiotic for two to three
weeks and will also take anti-inflammatory medication for about the same length of time. If the patient
experiences inflammation, redness, or pain, they
should seek immediate medical treatment to avoid
serious complications.

Risks
Cataract surgery itself is quite safe; over 90% of the
time, there are no complications. Possible complications

include intraocular infection (endophthalmitis), central
retinal inflammation (macular edema), post-operative
glaucoma, retinal detachment, bleeding under the retina
(choroidal hemorrhage), and tiny lens fragments in the
back (vitreous) cavity of the eye, all of which can lead to
loss of sight. Since increased use of the phacoemulsification method of cataract surgery, researchers have noted
a decline in cases of infection (endophthalmitis). This
probably is because injectable intraocular lenses do not
make contact with the ocular surface. In 2004, the FDA
approved a new capsular tension ring for use in cataract
surgery that helps prevent lens dislocation and other
possible complications of surgery.

Normal results
Ordinarily, patients experience improved visual
acuity and improved perception of the vividness of
colors, leading to increased abilities in many activities,
including reading, needlework, driving, golf, and tennis, for example. In addition, sometimes implanted
corrective lenses eliminate the need for eyeglasses
or contact lenses. Researchers and manufacturers
also continue to work to improve the lenses available
in cataract surgeries, so that eventual vision and outcome are improved.

I Cataracts
Definition
A cataract is a cloudiness or opacity in the normally transparent crystalline lens of the eye. This
cloudiness can cause a decrease in vision and may
lead to eventual blindness.

Description
The human eye has several parts. The outer layer
of the eyeball consists of a transparent dome-shaped
cornea and an opaque, white sclera. The cornea and
sclera help protect the eye. The next layer includes the
iris, pupil, and ciliary body. The iris is the colored part
of the eye and the pupil is the small dark round hole in
the middle of the iris. The pupil and iris allow light
into the eye. The ciliary body contains muscles that
help in the eye’s focusing ability. The lens lies behind
the pupil and iris. It is covered by a cellophane-like
capsule. The lens is normally transparent, elliptical in
shape, and somewhat elastic. This elasticity allows the
lens to focus on both near and far objects. The lens is

Cataracts

attached to the ciliary body by fibers (zonules of Zinn).
Muscles in the ciliary body act on the zonules, which
then change the shape of the lens. This process is called
accommodation—the lens focuses images to help
make vision clear. As people age, the lens hardens
and changes shape less easily. As a result, the accommodation process becomes more difficult, making it
harder to see things up close. This generally occurs
around the age of 40 and continues until about age 65.
The condition is called presbyopia. It is a normal condition of aging, generally resulting in the need for
reading glasses.
The lens is made up of approximately 35% protein
and 65% water. As people age, degenerative changes
in the lens’s proteins occur. Changes in the proteins,
water content, enzymes, and other chemicals are some
of the reasons for the formation of a cataract.
The major areas of the lens are the nucleus, the
cortex, and the capsule. The nucleus is in the center of
the lens, the cortex surrounds the nucleus, and the
capsule is the outer layer. Opacities can occur in any
area of the lens. Cataracts, then, can be classified
according to location (nuclear, cortical, or posterior
subcapular cataracts). The density and location of the
cataract determine the amount of vision affected. If
the cataract forms in the area of the lens directly
behind the pupil, vision may be significantly impaired.
A cataract that occurs on the outer edges or side of the
lens will create less of a visual problem.
Cataracts in the elderly are so common that they
are thought to be a normal part of the aging process.
Between the ages of 52 and 64, there is a 50% chance of
having a cataract, while at least 70% of those 70 and
older are affected. In 2004, it was revealed that blacks
are twice as likely to develop cataracts as whites.
Cataracts associated with aging (senile or age-related
cataracts) most often occur in both eyes, with
each cataract progressing at a different rate. Initially,
cataracts may not affect vision. If the cataract remains
small or at the periphery of the lens, the visual changes
may be minor.
Cataracts that occur in people other than the
elderly are much less common. Congenital cataracts
occur very rarely in newborns. Genetic defects or an
infection or disease in the mother during pregnancy are
among the causes of congenital cataracts. Traumatic
cataracts may develop after a foreign body or trauma
injures the lens or eye. Systemic illnesses, such as
diabetes, may result in cataracts. Cataracts can also
occur secondary to other eye diseases—for example,
an inflammation of the inner layer of the eye (uveitis)
or glaucoma. Such cataracts are called complicated
750

cataracts. Toxic cataracts result from chemical toxicity, such as steroid use. Cataracts can also result from
exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays.

Causes and symptoms
Recent studies have been conducted to try to
determine whether diet or the use of vitamins might
have an effect on the formation of cataracts in older
people. The results have been mixed, with some studies
finding a connection and other studies finding none.
Much interest has been focused on the use of antioxidant supplements as a protection against cataracts.
Antioxidant vitamins such as vitamins A, C, E and
beta-carotene help the body clean-up oxygen-free
radicals. Some vitamins are marketed specifically for
the eyes. Patients should speak to their doctors about
the use of such vitamins.
Smoking and alcohol intake have been implicated
in cataract formation. Some studies have determined
that a diet high in fat will increase the likelihood of
cataract formation, while an increase in foods rich in
antioxidants will reduce the incidence. More research
is needed to determine if diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, or vitamins have any connection to the
formation of cataracts.
There are several common symptoms of cataracts:


gradual, painless onset of blurry, filmy, or fuzzy
vision



poor central vision



frequent changes in eyeglass prescription



changes in color vision



increased glare from lights, especially oncoming
headlights when driving at night



‘‘second sight’’ improvement in near vision (no
longer needing reading glasses), but a decrease in
distance vision



poor vision in sunlight



presence of a milky whiteness in the pupil as the
cataract progresses.

Diagnosis
Both ophthalmologists and optometrists may
detect and monitor cataract growth and prescribe
prescription lenses for visual deficits. However, only
an ophthalmologist can perform cataract extraction.
Cataracts are easily diagnosed from the reporting
of symptoms, a visual acuity exam using an eye chart,
and by examination of the eye itself. Shining a penlight

Cubberly, Phototake NYC. Reproduced by permission.)

into the pupil may reveal opacities or a color change of
the lens even before visual symptoms have developed.
An instrument called a slit lamp is basically a large
microscope. This lets the doctor examine the front of
the eye and the lens. The slit lamp helps the doctor
determine the location of the cataract.
Some other diagnostic tests may be used to determine if cataracts are present or how well the patient
may potentially see after surgery. These include a
glare test, potential vision test, and contrast sensitivity test.

Treatment
For cataracts that cause no symptoms or only
minor visual changes, no treatment may be necessary.
Continued monitoring and assessment of the cataract
is needed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist at
scheduled office visits. Increased strength in prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses may be helpful. This
may be all that is required if the cataract does not
reduce the patient’s quality of life.
Cataract surgery—the only option for patients
whose cataracts interfere with vision to the extent of
affecting their daily lives—is the most frequently performed surgery in the United States. It generally
improves vision in over 90% of patients. Some people
have heard that a cataract should be ‘‘ripe’’ before
being removed. A cataract is considered ripe or
mature when the lens is completely opaque. Most
cataracts are removed before they reach this stage.
Sometimes cataracts need to be removed so that the
doctor can examine the back of the eye more carefully. This is important in patients with diseases that
may affect the eye. If cataracts are present in both
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Surgery to remove cataracts is generally an outpatient procedure. A local anesthetic is used and
the procedure lasts about one hour. Removal of
the cloudy lens can be done by several different
procedures. The three types of cataract surgery available are:


Extracapsular cataract extraction. This type of cataract extraction is the most common. The lens and
the front portion of the capsule are removed. The
back part of the capsule remains, providing strength
to the eye.



Intracapsular cataract extraction. The lens and the
entire capsule are removed. This method carries an
increased risk for detachment of the retina and swelling after surgery. It is rarely used.



Phacoemulsification. This type of extracapsular
extraction needs a very small incision, resulting in
faster healing. Ultrasonic vibration is applied to the
lens to break it up into very small pieces which are then
aspirated out of the eye with suction by the ophthalmologist. A new liquid technique that its inventor says
may one day replace ultrasound has been invented,
but has not yet been proven in clinical trials.

A replacement lens is usually inserted at the time
of the surgery. A plastic artificial lens called an intraocular lens (IOL) is placed in the remaining posterior
lens capsule of the eye. When the intracapsular extraction method is used, an IOL may be clipped onto the
iris. Contact lenses and cataract glasses (aphakic
lenses) are prescribed if an IOL was not inserted. A
folding IOL is used when phacoemulsification is performed to accommodate the small incision.
Antibiotic drops to prevent infection and steroids
to reduce inflammation are prescribed after surgery.
An eye shield or glasses during the day will protect the
eye from injury while it heals. During the night, an eye
shield is worn. The patient returns to the doctor the
day after surgery for assessment, with several followup visits over the next two months to monitor the
healing process.

eyes, only one eye at a time should be operated on.
Healing occurs in the first eye before the second
cataract is removed, sometimes as early as the following week. A final eyeglass prescription is usually
given about four to six weeks after surgery. Patients
will still need reading glasses. The overall health of
the patient needs to be considered in making the
decision to operate. However, age alone need not
preclude effective surgical treatment of cataracts.
People in their nineties can have successful return of
vision after cataract surgery.

Catatonia

KEY TERMS
Aphakia—Absence of the lens of the eye.
Ciliary body—A structure in the eye that contains
muscles that will affect the focusing of the lens.
Glaucoma—Disease of the eye characterized by
increased pressure of the fluid inside the eye.
Untreated, glaucoma can lead to blindness.
Phacoemulsification—Surgical proceduretoremove
a cataract using sound waves to disintegrate the lens
which is then removed by suction.
Retina—The innermost layer of the eyeball. Images
focused onto the retina are then sent to the brain.
Ultraviolet radiation (UV)—Invisible light rays
that may be responsible for sunburns, skin cancers,
and cataract formation.
Uveitis—Inflammation of the uvea. The uvea is a
continuous layer of tissue that consists of the iris,
the ciliary body, and the choroid. The uvea lies
between the retina and sclera.

Prognosis
The success rate of cataract extraction is very
high, with a good prognosis. A visual acuity of 20/40
or better may be achieved. If an extracapsular cataract
extraction was performed, a secondary cataract may
develop in the remaining back portion of the capsule.
This can occur one to two years after surgery. YAG
capsulotomy is most often used for this type of cataract. YAG stands for yttrium aluminum garnet, the
name of the laser used for this procedure. This is a
painless outpatient procedure and requires no incision. The laser beam makes a small opening in the
remaining back part of the capsule, allowing light
through.
In a very small percentage (3–5%) of surgical
cataract extractions, complications occur. Infections,
swelling of the cornea (edema), bleeding, retinal
detachment, and the onset of glaucoma have been
reported. Some problems may occur one to two days,
or even several weeks, after surgery. Any haziness,
redness, decrease in vision, nausea, or pain should be
reported to the surgeon immediately.

Prevention
Preventive measures emphasize protecting the
eyes from UV radiation by wearing glasses with
a special coating to protect against UV rays. Dark
752

lenses alone are not sufficient. The lenses must
protect against UV light (specifically, UV-A and
UV-B). Antioxidants may also provide some protection by reducing free radicals that can damage lens
proteins. A healthy diet rich in sources of antioxidants,
including citrus fruits, sweet potatoes, carrots, green
leafy vegetables, and/or vitamin supplements may
be helpful. In 2004, research in England revealed
that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (over-the
counter pain killers such as aspirin) may help decrease
risk of cataracts by as much as 43%. When taking
certain medications, such as steroids, more frequent
eye exams may be necessary. Patients should speak
to their doctors to see if medications may affect
their eyes.

I Catatonia
Definition
Catatonia is a condition marked by changes in
muscle tone or activity associated with a large number
of serious mental and physical illnesses. There are two
distinct sets of symptoms that are characteristic of
this condition. In catatonic stupor the individual
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Other signs and symptoms include violence directed
toward him/herself, the assumption of inappropriate
posture, selective mutism, negativism, facial grimaces, and animal-like noises.

Features of catatonia may also be seen in
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) which is an
uncommon (but potentially lethal) reaction to some
medications used to treat major mental illnesses. NMS
is considered a medical emergency since 25% of
untreated cases result in death. Catatonia can also be
present in individuals suffering from a number of
other physical and emotional conditions such as drug
intoxication, depression, and schizophrenia. It is most
commonly associated with mood disorders.

Catatonic stupor is marked by immobility and a
behavior known as cerea flexibilitas (waxy flexibility)
in which the individual can be made to assume bizarre
(and sometimes painful) postures that they will maintain for extended periods of time. The individual may
become dehydrated and malnourished because food
and liquids are refused. In extreme situations such
individuals must be fed through a tube. Catatonic
excitement is characterized by hyperactivity and violence; the individual may harm him/herself or others.
On rare occasions, isolation or restraint may be
needed to ensure the individual’s safety and the safety
of others.

Description
In catatonic stupor, motor activity may be reduced
to zero. Individuals avoid bathing and grooming,
make little or no eye contact with others, may be
mute and rigid, and initiate no social behaviors. In
catatonic excitement the individual is extremely hyperactive although the activity seems to have no purpose.
Violence toward him/herself or others may also be
seen.
NMS is observed as a dangerous side effect associated with certain neuroleptic (antipsychotic) drugs
such as haloperidol (Haldol). It comes on suddenly
and is characterized by stiffening of the muscles,
fever, confusion and heavy sweating.
Catatonia can also be categorized as intrinsic or
extrinsic. If the condition has an identifiable cause, it is
designated as extrinsic. If no cause can be determined
following physical examination, laboratory testing,
and history taking, the illness is considered to be
intrinsic.

Causes and symptoms
The causes of catatonia are largely unknown
although research indicates that brain structure and
function are altered in this condition. While this and
other information point to a physical cause, none has
yet been proven. A variety of medical conditions also
may lead to catatonia including head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, encephalitis, and certain metabolic
disorders. NMS is an adverse side effect of certain
antipsychotic drugs.
A variety of symptoms are associated with
catatonia. Among the more common are echopraxia
(imitation of the gestures of others) and echolalia
(parrot-like repetition of words spoken by others).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis
Recognition of catatonia is made on the basis of
specific movement symptoms. These include odd ways
of walking such as walking on tiptoes or ritualistic
pacing, and rarely, hopping and skipping. Repetitive
odd movements of the fingers or hands, as well as
imitating the speech or movements of others also
may indicate that catatonia is present. There are no
laboratory or other tests that can be used to positively
diagnose this condition, but medical and neurological
tests are necessary to rule out underlying lesions or
disorders that may be causing the symptoms observed.

Treatment
Treatment of catatonia includes medications such
as benzodiazipines (which are the preferred treatment)
and rarely barbiturates. Antipsychotic drugs may be
appropriate in some cases, but often cause catatonia to
worsen. Electroconvulsive therapy may prove beneficial for clients who do not respond to medication. If
these approaches are unsuccessful, treatment will be
redirected to attempts to control the signs and symptoms of the illness.

Prognosis
Catatonia usually responds quickly to medication
interventions.

Prevention
There is currently no known way to prevent catatonia because the cause has not yet been identified.
Research efforts continue to explore possible origins.

experiences a deficit of motor (movement) activity that
can render him/her motionless. Catatonic excitement,
or excessive movement, is associated with violent
behavior directed toward oneself or others.

Catecholamines tests

KEY TERMS
Barbiturates—A group of medicines that slow
breathing and lower the body temperature and
blood pressure. They can be habit forming and are
now used chiefly for anesthesia.
Benzodiazipines—This group of medicines is used
to help reduce anxiety (especially before surgery)
and to help people sleep.
Electroconvulsive therapy—This type of therapy
is used to treat major depression and severe
mental illness that does not respond to medications. A measured dose of electricity is introduced
into the brain in order to produce a convulsion.
Electroconvulsive therapy is safe and effective.
Mutism—The inability or refusal to speak.
Negativism—Behavior characterized by resistance, opposition, and refusal to cooperate with
requests, even the most reasonable ones.
Neuroleptic drugs—Antipsychotic drugs, including major tranquilizers, used in the treatment of
psychoses like schizophrenia.

Avoiding excessive use of neuroleptic drugs can
help minimize the risk of developing catatonic-like
symptoms.

I Catecholamines tests
Definition
Catecholamines is a collective term for the hormones epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine.
Manufactured chiefly by the chromaffin cells of the
adrenal glands, these hormones are involved in readying the body for the ‘‘fight-or-flight’’ response (also
known as the alarm reaction). When these hormones
are released, the heart beats stronger and faster, blood
pressure rises, more blood flows to the brain and
754

muscles, the liver releases stores of energy as a sugar
the body can readily use (glucose), the rate of breathing increases and airways widen, and digestive activity
slows. These reactions direct more oxygen and fuel to
the organs most active in responding to stress–mainly
the brain, heart, and skeletal muscles.

Purpose
Pheochromocytoma (a tumor of the chromaffin
cells of the adrenal gland) and tumors of the nervous
system (neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and
ganglioneuromas) that affect hormone production can
cause excessive levels of different catecholamines to be
secreted. This results in constant or intermittent
high blood pressure (hypertension). Episodes of high
blood pressure may be accompanied by symptoms
such as headache, sweating, palpitations, and anxiety.
The catecholamines test can be ordered, then, to determine if high blood pressure and other symptoms are
related to improper hormone secretion and to identify
the type of tumor causing elevated catecholamine levels.

Description
The catecholamines test can be performed on
either blood or urine. If performed on blood, the test
may require one or two samples, depending on the
physician’s request. The first blood sample will be
drawn after the patient has been lying down in a
warm, comfortable environment for at least 30 minutes. If a second sample is needed, the patient will be
asked to stand for 10 minutes before the blood is
drawn. Instead of a venipuncture, which can be stressful for the patient, possibly increasing catecholamine
levels in the blood, a plastic or rubber tube-like device
called a catheter may be used to collect the blood
samples. The catheter would be inserted in a vein
24 hours in advance, eliminating the need for needle
punctures at the time of the test.
It may take up to a week for a lab to complete
testing of the samples. Because blood levels of catecholamines commonly go up and down in response to such
factors as temperature, stress, postural change, diet,
smoking, obesity, and many drugs, abnormally high
blood test results should be confirmed with a 24-hour
urine test. In addition, catecholamine secretion from a
tumor may not be steady, but may occur periodically
during the day, and potentially could be missed when
blood testing is used. The urine test provides the laboratory with a specimen that reflects catecholamine production over an entire 24-hour period. If urine is tested,
the patient or a healthcare worker must collect all the
urine passed over the 24-hour period.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS

It is important that the patient refrain from using
certain medications, especially cold or allergy remedies,
for two weeks before the test. Certain foods–including
bananas, avocados, cheese, coffee, tea, cocoa, beer,
licorice, citrus fruit, vanilla, and Chianti–must be
avoided for 48 hours prior to testing. However, people
should be sure to get adequate amounts of vitamin C
before the test, because this vitamin is necessary for
catecholamine formation. The patient should be fasting
(nothing to eat or drink) for 10 to 24 hours before
the blood test and should not smoke for 24 hours
beforehand. Some laboratories may call for additional
restrictions. As much as possible, the patient should try
to avoid excessive physical exercise and emotional
stress before the test, because either may alter test
results by causing increased secretion of epinephrine
and norepinephrine.

Dopamine—Dopamine is a precursor of epinephrine
and norepinephrine.
Epinephrine— Epinephrine, also called adrenaline,
is a naturally occurring hormone released by
the adrenal glands in response to signals from the
sympathetic nervous system. These signals are triggered by stress, exercise, or by emotions such as
fear.
Ganglioneuroma—A ganglioneuroma is a tumor
composed of mature nerve cells.
Neuroblastoma—Neuroblastoma is a tumor of the
adrenal glands or sympathetic nervous system.
Neuroblastomas can range from being relatively
harmless to highly malignant.
Norepinephrine—Norepinephrine is a hormone
secreted by certain nerve endings of the sympathetic nervous system, and by the medulla (center)
of the adrenal glands. Its primary function is to help
maintain a constant blood pressure by stimulating
certain blood vessels to constrict when the blood
pressure falls below normal.

Patients collecting their own 24-hour urine samples will be given a container with special instructions.
The urine samples must be refrigerated.

Risks
Risks for the blood test are minimal, but may
include slight bleeding from the venipuncture site,
fainting or feeling lightheaded after blood is drawn,
or blood accumulating under the puncture site (hematoma). There are no risks for the urine test.

Pheochromocytoma—A pheochromocytoma is a
tumor that originates from the adrenal gland’s chromaffin cells, causing overproduction of catecholamines, powerful hormones that induce high blood
pressure and other symptoms.

Normal results
Reference ranges are laboratory-specific, vary
according to methodology of testing, and differ
between blood and urine samples. If testing is done
by the method called High Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC), typical values for blood
and urine follow.

Abnormal results
Depending on the results, high catecholamine
levels can indicate different conditions and/or causes:


High catecholamine levels can help to verify pheochromocytoma, neuroblastoma, or ganglioneuroma.
An aid to diagnosis is the fact that an adrenal medullary tumor (pheochromocytoma) secretes epinephrine, whereas ganglioneuroma and neuroblastoma
secrete norepinephrine.



Elevations are possible with, but do not directly
confirm, thyroid disorders, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), or heart disease.



Electroshock therapy, or shock resulting from
hemorrhage or exposure to toxins, can raise catecholamine levels.



In the patient with normal or low baseline catecholamine levels, failure to show an increase in the sample
taken after standing suggests an autonomic nervous

Reference ranges for blood catecholamines
Supine (lying down): Epinephrine less than
50 pg/mL, norepinephrine less than 410 pg/mL, and
dopamine less than 90 pg/mL. Standing: Values for
blood specimens taken when the subject is standing are higher than the ranges for supine posture
for norepinephrine and epinephrine, but not for
dopamine.
Reference ranges for urine catecholamines
Epinephrine 0–20 micrograms per 24 hours; norepinephrine 15–80 micrograms per 24 hours; dopamine

mechanical pacemaker can be put in place.

Purpose
Irregular heartbeats can occur in healthy people
without causing any dangerous symptoms or requiring
medical attention. Slight changes in the normal patterns of heartbeats often reset themselves without
notice.
But when the heartbeat is greatly disrupted–either
because of traumatic injury, disease, hypertension, surgery, or reduced blood flow to the heart caused by
blockages in the blood vessels that nourish the heart–
the condition must be recognized and treated immediately. Otherwise, it can be fatal.
Various drugs can be used to control and help reset
these abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias). The technique of catheter ablation (meaning tube-guided
removal) is used to interrupt the abnormal contractions
in the heart, allowing normal heart beating to resume.
Atrial fibrillation and flutter and Wolff-ParkinsonWhite syndrome are two of the most common disorders
treated with catheter ablation.

Catheter ablation involves delivering highly
focused heat (or radio frequency energy) to specific
areas of the heart. Radio frequency energy is very
rapidly alternating electrical current that is produced
at the tip of the catheter that is placed inside the heart.
At the same time as the catheter is inserted, a second
electrode is placed on the patient’s skin. When the
catheter is energized, the body conducts the energy
from the catheter’s tip, through the heart and to the
electrode on the skin’s surface, completing the circuit.
Although very little electricity is given off by the
catheter, the instrument does generate a large amount of
heat. This heat is absorbed by the heart tissue, causing a
small localized burn and destroying the tissue in contact
with the catheter tip; in this way, small regions of heart
tissue are burned in a controlled manner. This controlled destruction of small sections of heart muscle
actually kills the nerve cells causing the irregular heartbeat, stopping the nerve signals that are passing through
this section of the heart. This usually causes the irregular
heartbeat to be reset into a normal heartbeat.

Preparation
People can undergo this procedure by having
general anesthesia or by taking medicines to make
them relaxed and sleepy (sedatives) along with painkillers. Once the type of irregular heartbeat is identified and these medicines are given, the catheter is
inserted through a blood vessel and into the heart.
Importantly, correct placement of the catheter is
visualized by using a specialized type of x-ray machine
called a fluoroscope.

Aftercare
Being sure the patient is comfortable during and
after this procedure is very important. However,
because each person may have a different arrhythmia
and possibly other medical problems as well, each
patient’s needs must be evaluated individually.

Risks
Precautions
The improper correction of abnormal heartbeats
can cause additional arrhythmias and can be fatal.
Abnormalities in different areas of the heart cause
different types of irregular heartbeats; the type of

Overall, fewer than 5% of people having this
procedure experience complications. The most common complications are usually related to blood vessel
injury when the catheter is inserted and to different
heart-related problems due to the moving of the

Normal results
Depending upon the type of irregular heartbeat
being treated, either the normal heartbeat resumes
after treatment or the ability of the heart to beat on
its own is lost, requiring the insertion of a pacemaker
to stimulate the heart to beat regularly.

Abnormal results
Additional irregular heartbeats can occur as a
result of this procedure, as can damage to the blood
vessels that feed the heart. Because this procedure
requires the use of the x-ray machine called a fluoroscope, there is exposure to x-ray radiation, but it is
doubtful that this is harmful in adult patients. The
risk versus benefit is considered with pediatric patients.

I Celiac disease
Definition
Celiac disease is a disease of the digestive system
that damages the small intestine and interferes with
the absorption of nutrients from food.

Description
Celiac disease occurs when the body reacts abnormally to gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, barley,
and possibly oats. When someone with celiac disease
eats foods containing gluten, that person’s immune
system causes an inflammatory response in the small
intestine, which damages the tissues and results in
impaired ability to absorb nutrients from foods. The
inflammation and malabsorption create wide-ranging
problems in many systems of the body. Since the
body’s own immune system causes the damage, celiac
disease is classified as an ‘‘autoimmune’’ disorder.
Celiac disease may also be called sprue, nontropical
sprue, gluten sensitive enteropathy, celiac sprue, and
adult celiac disease.
Celiac disease may be discovered at any age,
from infancy through adulthood. The disorder is
more commonly found among white Europeans or in
people of European descent. It is very unusual to find
celiac disease in African or Asian people. The exact
758

incidence of the disease is uncertain. Estimates vary
from one in 5000, to as many as one in every 300
individuals with this background. The prevalence of
celiac disease seems to be different from one European
country to another, and between Europe and the
United States. This may be due to differences in diet
and/or unrecognized disease. A recent study of random blood samples tested for celiac disease in the US
showed one in 250 testing positive. It is clearly underdiagnosed, probably due to the symptoms being
attributed to another problem, or lack of knowledge
about celiac disease by physicians and laboratories.
Because of the known genetic component, relatives
of patients with celiac disease are considered at higher
risk for the disorder.
Because celiac disease has a hereditary influence,
close relatives (especially first degree relatives, such as
children, siblings, and parents) have a higher risk of
being affected with the condition. The chance that a
first degree relative of someone with celiac disease will
have the disease is about 10%.
As more is learned about celiac disease, it becomes
evident that it has many variations which may not
produce typical symptoms. It may even be clinically
‘‘silent,’’ where no obvious problems related to the
disease are apparent.

Causes and symptoms
Celiac disease can run in families and has a genetic
basis, although the pattern of inheritance is complicated. The type of inheritance pattern that celiac disease
follows is called multifactorial (caused by many factors,
both genetic and environmental). Researchers think
that several factors must exist in order for the disease
to occur. The patient must have a genetic predisposition
to develop the disorder. Then, something in their environment acts as a stimulus, or ‘‘trigger,’’ to their immune
system, causing the disease to become active for the first
time. For conditions with multifactorial inheritance,
people without the genetic predisposition are less likely
to develop the condition with exposure to the same
triggers. Or, they may require more exposure to the
stimulus before developing the disease than someone
with a genetic predisposition. Some of the things which
may provoke a reaction include surgery, especially gastrointestinal surgery; a change to a low fat diet, which
has an increased number of wheat-based foods; pregnancy; childbirth; severe emotional stress; or a viral
infection. This combination of genetic susceptibility
and an outside agent leads to celiac disease.
Each person with celiac disease is affected differently. When food containing gluten reaches the small
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The most commonly recognized symptoms of
celiac disease relate to the improper absorption of
food in the gastrointestinal system. Many patients
with gastrointestinal symptoms will have diarrhea
and fatty, greasy, unusually foul-smelling stools. The
patient may complain of excessive gas (flatulence),
distended abdomen, weight loss, and generalized
weakness. Not all people have digestive system complications; some people only have irritability or
depression. Irritability is one of the most common
symptoms in children with celiac disease.
Not all patients have these problems. Unrecognized
and therefore untreated celiac disease may cause or contribute to a variety of other conditions. The decreased
ability to digest, absorb, and utilize food properly
(malabsorption) may cause anemia (low red blood
count) from iron deficiency or easy bruising from a lack
of vitamin K. Poor mineral absorption may result in
osteoporosis, or ‘‘brittle bones,’’ which may lead to
bone fractures. Vitamin D levels may be insufficient
and bring about a ‘‘softening’’ of bones (osteomalacia),
which produces pain and bony deformities, such as flattening or bending. Defects in the tooth enamel, characteristic of celiac disease, may be recognized by dentists.
Celiac disease may be discovered during medical tests
performed to investigate failure to thrive in infants, or
lack of proper growth in children and adolescents.
People with celiac disease may also experience lactose
intolerance because they don’t produce enough of
the enzyme lactase, which breaks down the sugar in
milk into a form the body can absorb. Other symptoms
can include muscle cramps, fatigue, delayed growth, tingling or numbness in the legs (from nerve damage), pale
sores in the mouth (called aphthus ulcers), tooth discoloration, or missed menstrual periods (due to severe
weight loss).
A distinctive, painful skin rash, called dermatitis
herpetiformis, may be the first sign of celiac disease.
Approximately 10% of patients with celiac disease
have this rash, but it is estimated that 85% or more
of patients with the rash have the disease.
Many disorders are associated with celiac disease, though the nature of the connection is unclear.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

One type of epilepsy is linked to celiac disease.
Once their celiac disease is successfully treated, a
significant number of these patients have fewer or
no seizures. Patients with alopecia areata, a condition
where hair loss occurs in sharply defined areas, have
been shown to have a higher risk of celiac disease
than the general population. There appears to be a
higher percentage of celiac disease among people
with Down syndrome, but the link between the conditions is unknown.
Several conditions attributed to a disorder of the
immune system have been associated with celiac disease. People with insulin dependent diabetes (type I)
have a much higher incidence of celiac disease. One
source estimates that as many as one in 20 insulindependent diabetics may have celiac disease. Patients
with other conditions where celiac disease may be
more commonly found include those with juvenile
chronic arthritis, some thyroid diseases, and IgA
deficiency.
There is an increased risk of intestinal lymphoma,
a type of cancer, in individuals with celiac disease.
Successful treatment of the celiac disease seems to
decrease the chance of developing lymphoma.

Diagnosis
Because of the variety of ways celiac disease can
manifest itself, it is often not discovered promptly. Its
symptoms are similar to many other conditions
including irritible bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease,
ulcerative colitis, diverticulosis, intestinal infections,
chronic fatigue syndrome, and depression. The condition may persist without diagnosis for so long that the
patient accepts a general feeling of illness as normal.
This leads to further delay in identifying and treating
the disorder. It is not unusual for the disease to be
identified in the course of medical investigations for
seemingly unrelated problems. For example, celiac
disease has been discovered during testing to find the
cause of infertility.
If celiac disease is suspected, a blood test can be
ordered. This test looks for the antibodies to gluten
(called antigliadin, anti-endomysium, and antireticulin) that the immune system produces in celiac disease.
Antibodies are chemicals produced by the immune
system in response to substances that the body perceives to be threatening. Some experts advocate not
just evaluating patients with symptoms, but using
these blood studies as a screening test for high-risk
individuals, such as those with relatives (especially
first degree relatives) known to have the disorder. An
abnormal result points towards celiac disease, but
759

Celiac disease

intestine, the immune system begins to attack a substance called gliadin, which is found in the gluten. The
resulting inflammation causes damage to the delicate
finger-like structures in the intestine, called villi, where
food absorption actually takes place. The patient may
experience a number of symptoms related to the inflammation and the chemicals it releases, and/or the lack of
ability to absorb nutrients from food, which can cause
malnutrition.

Celiac disease

further tests are needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Because celiac disease affects the ability of the body
to absorb nutrients from food, several tests may be
ordered to look for nutritional deficiencies. For example, doctors may order a test of iron levels in the blood
because low levels of iron (anemia) may accompany
celiac disease. Doctors may also order a test for fat in
the stool, since celiac disease prevents the body from
absorbing fat from food.
If these tests above are suspicious for celiac disease, the next step is a biopsy (removal of a tiny piece
of tissue surgically) of the small intestine. This is
usually done by a gastroenterologist, a physician
who specializes in diagnosing and treating bowel disorders. It is generally performed in the office, or in a
hospital’s outpatient department. The patient
remains awake, but is sedated. A narrow tube, called
an endoscope, is passed through the mouth, down
through the stomach, and into the small intestine.
A small sample of tissue is taken and sent to the
laboratory for analysis. If it shows a pattern of tissue
damage characteristic of celiac disease, the diagnosis
is established.
The patient is then placed on a gluten-free diet
(GFD). The physician will periodically recheck the
level of antibody in the patient’s blood. After several
months, the small intestine is biopsied again. If the
diagnosis of celiac disease was correct (and the patient
followed the rigorous diet), healing of the intestine will
be apparent. Most experts agree that it is necessary to
follow these steps in order to be sure of an accurate
diagnosis.

Treatment
The only treatment for celiac disease is a glutenfree diet. This may be easy for the doctor to prescribe,
but difficult for the patient to follow. For most people,
adhering to this diet will stop symptoms and prevent
damage to the intestines. Damaged villi can be functional again in three to six months. This diet must be
followed for life. For people whose symptoms are
cured by the gluten-free diet, this is further evidence
that their diagnosis is correct.
Gluten is present in any product that contains
wheat, rye, barley, or oats. It helps make bread rise,
and gives many foods a smooth, pleasing texture.
In addition to the many obvious places gluten can
be found in a normal diet, such as breads, cereals,
and pasta, there are many hidden sources of gluten.
These include ingredients added to foods to improve
texture or enhance flavor and products used in food

packaging. Gluten may even be present on surfaces
used for food preparation or cooking.
Fresh foods that have not been artificially processed,
such as fruits, vegetables, and meats, are permitted as
part of a GFD. Gluten-free foods can be found in
health food stores and in some supermarkets. Mailorder food companies often have a selection of glutenfree products. Help in dietary planning is available from
dieticians (healthcare professionals specializing in food
and nutrition) or from support groups for individuals
with celiac disease. There are many cookbooks on the
market specifically for those on a GFD.
Treating celiac disease with a GFD is almost
always completely effective. Gastrointestinal complaints
and other symptoms are alleviated. Secondary complications, such as anemia and osteoporosis, resolve in almost
all patients. People who have experienced lactose intolerance related to their celiac disease usually see those
symptoms subside, as well. Although there is no risk
and much potential benefit to this treatment, it is clear
that avoiding all foods containing gluten can be difficult.
Experts emphasize the need for lifelong adherence
to the GFD to avoid the long-term complications of
this disorder. They point out that although the disease
may have symptom-free periods if the diet is not followed, silent damage continues to occur. Celiac disease cannot be ‘‘outgrown’’ or cured, according to
medical authorities.

Prognosis
Patients with celiac disease must adhere to a strict
GFD throughout their lifetime. Once the diet has been
followed for several years, individuals with celiac disease have similar mortality rates as the general population. However, about 10% of people with celiac
disease develop a cancer involving the gastrointestinal
tract (both carcinoma and lymphoma).

Prevention
There is no way to prevent celiac disease.
However, the key to decreasing its impact on overall
health is early diagnosis and strict adherence to the
prescribed gluten-free diet.

Purpose
Cell therapy has been used successfully to rebuild
damaged cartilage in joints, repair spinal cord
injuries, strengthen a weakened immune system, treat
autoimmune diseases such as AIDS, and help patients
with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and epilepsy. Further uses
have shown positive results in the treatment of a wide
range of chronic conditions such as arteriosclerosis,
congenital defects, and sexual dysfunction. The therapy has also been used to treat cancer patients at a
number of clinics in Tijuana, Mexico, although this
application has not been well supported with controlled clinical studies.

I Cell therapy
Definition
Cell therapy is the transplantation of human
or animal cells to replace or repair damaged tissue
and/or cells.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The theory behind cell therapy has been in existence for several hundred years. The first recorded
discussion of the concept of cell therapy can be traced
to Phillippus Aureolus Paracelsus (1493–1541), a
German-Swiss physician and alchemist who wrote in
his Der grossen Wundartzney (‘‘Great Surgery Book’’)
in 1536 that ‘‘the heart heals the heart, lung heals the
lung, spleen heals the spleen; like cures like.’’
Paracelsus and many of his contemporaries agreed
that the best way to treat an illness was to use living
tissue to restore the ailing. In 1667, at a laboratory in
the palace of Louis XIV, Jean-Baptiste Denis (1640–
1704) attempted to transfuse blood from a calf into a
mentally ill patient—and since blood transfusion is, in
effect, a form of cell therapy, this could be the first
documented case of this procedure. However, the first
recorded attempt at non-blood cellular therapy
occurred in 1912 when German physicians attempted
to treat children with hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid, with thyroid cells.
In 1931, Dr. Paul Niehans (1882–1971), a Swiss
physician, became known as ‘‘the father of cell therapy’’ quite by chance. After a surgical accident by a
colleague, Niehans attempted to transplant a patient’s
severely damaged parathyroid glands with those of a
steer. When the patient began to rapidly deteriorate
before the transplant could take place, Niehans
decided to dice the steer’s parathyroid gland into fine
pieces, mix the pieces in a saline solution, and inject
them into the dying patient. Immediately, the patient
began to improve and, in fact, lived for another 30
years.
Cell therapy is, in effect, a type of organ transplant which has also been referred to as ‘‘live cell
761

Cell therapy

There are a small number of patients who
develop a refractory type of celiac disease, where
the GFD no longer seems effective. Once the diet
has been thoroughly assessed to ensure no hidden
sources of gluten are causing the problem, medications may be prescribed. Steroids or immunosuppressant drugs are often used to try to control the disease.
It is unclear whether these efforts meet with much
success.

Cell therapy

P A U L N I E H A N S (1882–1971)
Niehans enlisted in the Swiss Army in 1912. When
war erupted in the Balkans, Niehans set up a hospital in
Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The war provided him the opportunity to treat numerous patients, gaining a firsthand knowledge of the body and its workings.
Since 1913, Niehans had been intrigued with Alexis
Carrel’s experiments concerning the adaptive abilities of
cells, though Niehans himself specialized in glandular
transplants and by 1925 was one of the leading glandular
surgeons in Europe.
Niehans referred to 1931 as the birth year of cellular
therapy. That year, he treated a patient suffering from
tetany whose parathyroid had been erroneously removed
by another physician. Too weak for a glandular transplant,
the patient was given injections of the parathyroid glands
of steer, and she soon recovered. Niehans made more
injections, even experimenting on himself, and reported
he could cure illnesses through injections of live cells
extracted from healthy animal organs. He believed adding
new tissue stimulated rejuvenation and recovery.
(AP/Wide World Photos. Reproduced by permission.)

Paul Niehans was born and raised in Switzerland. His
father, a doctor, was dismayed when he entered the seminary, but Niehans quickly grew dissatisfied with religious
life and took up medicine after all. He first studied at Bern,
then completed an internship in Zurich.

therapy,’’ ‘‘xenotransplant therapy,’’ ‘‘cellular suspensions,’’ ‘‘glandular therapy,’’ or ‘‘fresh cell therapy.’’
The procedure involves the injection of either whole
fetal xenogenic (animal) cells (e.g., from sheep, cows,
pigs, and sharks) or cell extracts from human tissue.
The latter is known as autologous cell therapy if the
cells are extracted from and transplanted back into
the same patient. Several different types of cells can
be administered simultaneously.
Just as Paracelsus’s theory of ‘‘like cures like,’’ the
types of cells that are administered correspond in some
way with the organ or tissue in the patient that is failing.
No one knows exactly how cell therapy works, but
proponents claim that the injected cells travel to the
similar organ from which they were taken to revitalize
and stimulate that organ’s function and regenerate its
cellular structure. In other words, the cells are not
species specific, but only organ specific. Supporters of
cellular treatment believe that embryonic and fetal animal tissue contain active therapeutic agents distinct
from vitamins, minerals, hormones, or enzymes.
762

Niehans treated Pope Pious XII with his injections and
was nominated to the Vatican Academy of Science following the pope’s recovery.
Niehans remained a controversial figure throughout
his life. As of 2000, the Clinique Paul Niehans in
Switzerland, founded by his daughter, continued his work.

Swedish researchers have successfully transplanted human fetal stem cells into human recipients,
and the procedure is being investigated further as a
possible treatment for repairing brain cells in
Parkinson’s patients. However, because the cells used
in these applications must be harvested from aborted
human fetuses, there is an ethical debate over their use.
Currently, applications of cell therapy in the
United States is still in the research, experimental,
and clinical trial stages. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has approved the use of one cellular
therapy technique for repairing damaged knee joints.
The procedure involves removing healthy chondrocyte cells, the type of cell that forms cartilage, from
the patient, culturing them in a laboratory for three to
four weeks, and then transplanting them back into the
damaged knee joint of the patient.

Preparations
There are several processes to prepare cells for
use. One form involves extracting cells from the

Anaphylactic shock—A severe allergic reaction

patient they are to be used on and then culturing them
in a laboratory setting until they multiply to the level
needed for transplant back into the patient. Another
procedure uses freshly removed fetal animal tissue,
which has been processed and suspended in a saline
solution. The preparation of fresh cells then may be
either injected immediately into the patient, or preserved by being freeze-dried or deep-frozen in liquid
nitrogen before being injected. Cells may be tested
for pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, or parasites,
before use.

Precautions
Patients undergoing cell therapy treatments which
use cells transplanted from animals or other humans
run the risk of cell rejection, in which the body recognizes the cells as a foreign substance and uses the
immune system’s T-cells to attack and destroy them.
Some forms of cell therapy use special coatings on the
cells designed to trick the immune system into recognizing the new cells as native to the body.
There is also the chance of the cell solution transmitting bacterial or viral infection or other disease and
parasites to the patient. Careful screening and testing
of cells for pathogens can reduce this risk.
Many forms of cell therapy in the United States
are still largely experimental procedures. Patients
should approach these treatments with extreme caution, should inquire about their proven efficacy and
legal use in the United States, and should only accept
treatment from a licensed physician who should educate the patient completely on the risks and possible
side effects involved with cell therapy. These same
cautions apply for patients interested in participating
in clinical trials of cell therapy treatments.

Side effects
Because cell therapy encompasses such a wide
range of treatments and applications, and many of
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

these treatments are still experimental, the full range
of possible side effects of the treatments are not yet
known. Anaphylactic shock (severe allergic reaction),
immune system reactions, and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) are just a few of the known reported
side effects in some patients.
Side effects of the FDA–approved chondrocyte
cell therapy used in knee joint repair may include
tissue hypertrophy, a condition where too much cartilage grows in the joint where the cells were transplanted to and the knee joint begins to stiffen.

Research and general acceptance
There is a growing debate in the medical community over the efficacy and ethical implications of cell
therapy. Much of the ethical debate revolves around the
use of human fetal stem cells in treatment, and the fact
that these cells must be harvested from aborted fetuses.
While some cell therapy procedures have had
proven success in clinical studies, others are still largely unproven, including cell therapy for cancer
treatment. Until more large, controlled clinical studies are performed on these procedures to either
prove or disprove their efficacy, they will remain
fringe treatments.

I Cellulitis
Definition
Cellulitis is a spreading bacterial infection
just below the skin surface. It is most commonly
caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus
aureus.
763

Cellulitis

KEY TERMS

Cellulitis

Description
The word ‘‘cellulitis’’ actually means ‘‘inflammation of the cells.’’ Specifically, cellulitis refers to an
infection of the tissue just below the skin surface. In
humans, the skin and the tissues under the skin are the
most common locations for microbial infection. Skin
is the first defense against invading bacteria and other
microbes. An infection can occur when this normally
strong barrier is damaged due to surgery, injury, or a
burn. Even something as small as a scratch or an insect
bite allows bacteria to enter the skin, which may lead
to an infection. Usually, the immune system kills any
invading bacteria, but sometimes the bacteria are able
to grow and cause an infection.
Once past the skin surface, the warmth, moisture,
and nutrients allow bacteria to grow rapidly. Diseasecausing bacteria release proteins called enzymes which
cause tissue damage. The body’s reaction to damage is
inflammation which is characterized by pain, redness,
heat, and swelling. This red, painful region grows bigger
as the infection and resulting tissue damage spread. An
untreated infection may spread to the lymphatic system
(acute lymphangitis), the lymph nodes (lymphadenitis),
the bloodstream (bacteremia), or into deeper tissues.
Cellulitis most often occurs on the face, neck, and legs.
Orbital cellulitis
A very serious infection, called orbital cellulitis,
occurs when bacteria enter and infect the tissues surrounding the eye. In 50–70% of all cases of orbital
cellulitis, the infection spreads to the eye(s) from the
sinuses or the upper respiratory tract (nose and
throat). Twenty-five percent of orbital infections
occur after surgery on the face. Other sources of orbital infection include a direct infection from an eye
injury, from a dental or throat infection, and through
the bloodstream.
Infection of the tissues surrounding the eye causes
redness, swollen eyelids, severe pain, and causes the
eye to bulge out. This serious infection can lead to a
temporary loss of vision, blindness, brain abscesses,
inflammation of the brain and spinal tissues (meningitis), and other complications. Before the discovery of
antibiotics, orbital cellulitis caused blindness in 20% of
patients and death in 17% of patients. Antibiotic treatment has significantly reduced the incidence of blindness and death.

Causes and symptoms
Although other kinds of bacteria can cause cellulitis, it is most often caused by Streptococcus pyogenes
764

(the bacteria which causes strep throat) and
Staphylococcus aureus. Streptococcus pyogenes is the
so-called ‘‘flesh-eating bacteria’’ and, in rare cases, can
cause a dangerous, deep skin infection called necrotizing fasciitis. Orbital cellulitis may be caused by bacteria which cannot grow in the presence of oxygen
(anaerobic bacteria). In children, Haemophilus influenzae type B frequently causes orbital cellulitis following a sinus infection.
Streptococcus pyogenes can be picked up from a
person who has strep throat or an infected sore. Other
cellulitis-causing bacteria can be acquired from direct
contact with infected sores. Persons who are at a higher
risk for cellulitis are those who have a severe underlying
disease (such as cancer, diabetes, and kidney disease),
are taking steroid medications, have a reduced immune
system (because of AIDS, organ transplant, etc.), have
been burned, have insect bites, have reduced blood
circulation to limbs, or have had a leg vein removed
for coronary bypass surgery. In addition, chicken pox,
human or animal bite wounds, skin wounds, and recent
surgery can put a person at a higher risk for cellulitis.
The characteristic symptoms of cellulitis are redness, warmth, pain, and swelling. The infected area
appears as a red patch that gets larger rapidly within
the first 24 hours. A thick red line which progresses
towards the heart may appear indicating an infection
of the lymph vessels (lymphangitis). Other symptoms
which may occur include fever, chills, tiredness, muscle
aches, and a general ill feeling. Some people also
experience nausea, vomiting, stiff joints, and hair loss
at the infection site.
The characteristic symptoms of orbital cellulitis
are eye pain, redness, swelling, warmth, and tenderness. The eye may bulge out and it may be difficult or
impossible to move. Temporary loss of vision, pus
drainage from the eye, chills, fever, headaches, vomiting, and a general ill feeling may occur.

Diagnosis
Cellulitis may be diagnosed and treated by a family
doctor, an infectious disease specialist, a doctor who
specializes in skin diseases (dermatologist), or in the
case of orbital cellulitis, an eye doctor (ophthalmologist). The diagnosis of cellulitis is based mainly on the
patient’s symptoms. The patient’s recent medical history is also used in the diagnosis.
Laboratory tests may be done to determine which
kind of bacteria is causing the infection but these tests
are not always successful. If the skin injury is visible, a
sterile cotton swab is used to pick up a sample from the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Inflammation—A local, protective response to tissue injury. It is characterized by redness, warmth,
swelling, and pain.
Necrotizing fasciitis—A destructive infection
which follows severe cellulitis and involves the
deep skin and underlying tissues.
Sinuses—Air cavities found in the bones of the
head. The sinuses which are connected to the
nose are prone to infection.

wound. If there is no obvious skin injury, a needle may
be used to inject a small amount of sterile salt solution
into the infected skin, and then the solution is withdrawn. The salt solution should pick up some of
the bacteria causing the infection. A blood sample
may be taken from the patient’s arm to see if bacteria
have entered the bloodstream. Also, a blood test may
be done to count the number of white blood cells in the
blood. High numbers of white blood cells suggest that
the body is trying to fight a bacterial infection.
For orbital cellulitis, the doctor may often perform a special x-ray scan called computed tomography
scan (CT). This scan enables the doctor to see the
patient’s head in cross-section to determine exactly
where the infection is and see if any damage has
occurred. A CT scan takes about 20 minutes.

Treatment
Antibiotic treatment is the only way to battle this
potentially life-threatening infection. Mild to moderate cellulitis can be treated with the following antibiotics taken every four to eight hours by mouth:


penicillins (Bicillin, Wycillin, Pen Vee, V-Cillin)



erythromycin (E-Mycin, Ery-Tab)



cephalexin (Biocef, Keflex)



cloxacillin (Tegopen)

Other medications may be recommended, such as
acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil)
to relieve pain, and aspirin to decrease fever.
A normally healthy person is usually not hospitalized for mild or moderate cellulitis. General treatment
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

measures include elevation of the infected area, rest,
and application of warm, moist compresses to the
infected area. The doctor will want to see the patient
again to make sure that the antibiotic treatment is
effective in stopping the infection.
Persons at high risk for severe cellulitis will probably be hospitalized for treatment and monitoring.
Antibiotics may be given intravenously to patients
with severe cellulitis. Complications such as deep infection, or bone or joint infections, might require surgical
drainage and a longer course of antibiotic treatment.
Extensive tissue destruction may require plastic surgery
to repair. In cases of orbital cellulitis caused by a sinus
infection, surgery may be required to drain the sinuses.

Prognosis
Over 90% of all cellulitis cases are cured after seven
to ten days of antibiotic treatment. Persons with
serious disease and/or those who are taking immunosuppressive drugs may experience a more severe form of
cellulitis which can be life threatening. Serious complications include blood poisoning (bacteria growing in the
blood stream), meningitis (brain and spinal cord infection), tissue death (necrosis), and/or lymphangitis
(infection of the lymph vessels). Severe cellulitis caused
by Streptococcus pyogenes can lead to destructive and
life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis.

Prevention
Cellulitis may be prevented by wearing appropriate protective equipment during work and sports to
avoid skin injury, cleaning cuts and skin injuries with
antiseptic soap, keeping wounds clean and protected,
watching wounds for signs of infection, taking the
entire prescribed dose of antibiotic, and maintaining
good general health. Persons with diabetes should try
to maintain good blood sugar control.

depressants
Definition
Central nervous system (CNS) depressants are
drugs that can be used to slow down brain activity.

Purpose
CNS depressants may be prescribed by a physician to treat anxiety, muscle tension, pain, insomnia,
acute stress reactions, panic attacks, and seizure disorders. In higher doses, some CNS depressants may be
used as general anesthetics.

GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)—A neurotransmitter that slows down the activity of nerve
cells in the brain.
Neurotransmitter—A chemical compound in the
brain that carries signals from one nerve cell to
another.

uncomfortable; for example, withdrawal from a
depressant treating insomnia or anxiety can cause
rebound insomnia or anxiety as the brain’s activity
bounces back after being suppressed. In some cases
withdrawal can result in lifethreatening seizures.
Generally, depressant withdrawal should be undertaken under a physician’s supervision. Many physicians
will reduce the depressant dosage gradually, to give
the body time to adjust. Certain CNS depressants such
as barbiturates are easy to overdose on, since there is a
relatively small difference between the optimal dose
and an overdose. A small miscalculation can lead to
coma, slowed breathing, and death. CNS depressants
should be administered to elderly individuals with
care, as these individuals have a reduced ability to
metabolize CNS depressants.

Description
Throughout history, humans have sought relief
from anxiety and insomnia by using substances that
depress brain activity and induce a drowsy or calming effect. CNS depressants include a wide range of
drugs such as alcohol, narcotics, barbiturates (Amytal,
Nembutal, Seconal), benzodiazepines (Ativan, Halcion,
Librium, Valium, Xanax), chloral hydrate, and methaqualone (Quaaludes), as well as newer CNS depressants
developed in the 1990s, such as Buspirone (Buspar) and
Zolpidem (Ambien), which are thought to have the
fewest side effects. Most CNS depressants activate a
neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA), which helps decrease brain activity. Street
names for CNS depressants include Reds, Yellows,
Blues, Ludes, Barbs, and Downers.

Precautions
Most CNS depressants have the potential to be
physically and psychologically addictive. Alcohol is
the most widely abused depressant. The body
tends to develop tolerance for CNS depressants, and
larger doses are needed to achieve the same effects.
Withdrawal from some CNS depressants can be
766

Side Effects
Especially when taken in excess, CNS depressants
can cause confusion and dizziness, and impair judgment, memory, intellectual performance, and motor
coordination.

Interactions
CNS depressants should be used with other medications, such as antidepressant medications, only
under a physician’s supervision. Certain herbal remedies, such as Valerian and Kava, may dangerously
exacerbate the effects of certain CNS depressants.
Also, ingesting a combination of CNS depressants,
such Valium and alcohol, for example, is not advised.
When mixed together, CNS depressants tend to
amplify each other’s effects, which can cause severely
reduced heart rate and even death.

rare cases, head trauma or surgical procedures may
introduce bacteria directly into the CNS. However,
the source of infection cannot always be identified.
Specific symptoms of a CNS infection hinge on its
exact location, but may include severe headache or
back pain, weakness, sensory loss, and a fever. An
individual may report a stiff neck, nausea or vomiting,
and tiredness or disorientation. There is a potential for
seizures, paralysis, or coma.

Diagnosis

nervous system
I Central
infections
Definition
The central nervous system, or CNS, comprises
the brain, the spinal cord, and associated membranes.
Under some circumstances, bacteria may enter areas
of the CNS. If this occurs, abscesses or empyemas may
be established.

Description
In general, the CNS is well defended against infection. The spine and brain are sheathed in tough, protective membranes. The outermost membrane, the
dura mater, and the next layer, the arachnoid, entirely
encase the brain and spinal cord. However, these
defenses are not absolute. In rare cases, bacteria gain
access to areas within the CNS.
Bacterial infection of the CNS can result in
abscesses and empyemas (accumulations of pus).
Abscesses have fixed boundaries, but empyemas lack
definable shape and size. CNS infections are classified
according to the location where they occur. For example, a spinal epidural abscess is located above the dura
mater, and a cranial subdural empyema occurs
between the dura mater and the arachnoid.
As pus and other material from an infection accumulate, pressure is exerted on the brain or spinal cord.
This pressure can damage the nervous system tissue,
possibly permanently. Without treatment, a CNS
infection is fatal.

Causes and symptoms
Typically, bacterial invasion results from the
spread of a nearby infection; for example, a chronic
sinus or middle ear infection can extend beyond its
initial site. Bacteria may also be conveyed to the CNS
from distant sites of infection by the bloodstream. In
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Physical symptoms, such as a fever and intense
backache or a fever, severe headache, and stiff neck,
raise the suspicion of a CNS infection. Blood tests may
indicate the presence of an infection but do not pinpoint its location. CT scans or MRI scans of the brain
and spine can provide definitive diagnosis, with an
MRI scan being the most sensitive. A lumbar puncture
and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid can help diagnose an epidural abscess; however, the procedure can
be dangerous in cases of subdural empyema.

Treatment
A two-pronged approach is taken to treat CNS
infections. First, antibiotic therapy against an array of
potential infectious bacteria is begun. The second stage
involves surgery to drain the infected site. Although
some CNS infections have been resolved with antibiotics alone, the more aggressive approach is often preferred. Surgery allows immediate relief of pressure on
the brain or spinal cord, as well as an opportunity to
collect infectious material for bacterial identification.
Once the bacterial species is identified, drug therapy can
be altered to a more specific antibiotic. However, surgery may not be an option in some cases, such as when
there are numerous sites of infection or when infection
is located in an inaccessible area of the brain.

Prognosis
The fatality rate associated with CNS infections
ranges from 10% to as high as 40%. Some survivors
experience permanent CNS damage, resulting in partial paralysis, speech problems, or seizures. Rapid
diagnosis and treatment are essential for a good prognosis. With prompt medical attention, an individual
may recover completely.

Prevention
Treatment for pre-existing infections, such as sinus
or middle ear infections, may prevent some cases of

I Central
stimulants
Definition
Central nervous system (CNS) stimulants are medicines that speed up physical and mental processes.
768

Central nervous system stimulants are used to
treat conditions characterized by lack of adrenergic
stimulation, including narcolepsy and neonatal
apnea. Additionally, methylphenidate (Ritalin) and
dextroamphetamine sulfate (Dexedrine) are used for
their paradoxical effect in attention–deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
The anerexiants, benzphetamine (Didrex), diethylpropion (Tenuate), phendimetrazine (Bontril, Plegine),
phentermine (Fastin, Ionamine), and sibutramine
(Meridia) are CNS stimulants used for appetite reduction in severe obesity. Although these drugs are structurally similar to amphetamine, they cause less sensation
of stimulation, and are less suited for use in conditions
characterized by lack of adrenergic stimulation.
Phenylpropanolamine and ephedrine have been
used both as diet aids and as vasoconstrictors.

Description
The majority of CNS stimulants are chemically
similar to the neurohormone norepinephrine, and simulate the traditional ‘‘fight or flight’’ syndrome associated with sympathetic nervous system arousal.
Caffeine is more closely related to the xanthines, such
as theophylline. A small number of additional members
of the CNS stimulant class do not fall into specific
chemical groups.

Precautions
Amphetamines have a high potential for abuse.
They should be used in weight reduction programs
only when alternative therapies have been ineffective.
Administration for prolonged periods may lead to
drug dependence. These drugs are classified as schedule II under federal drug control regulations.
The amphetamines and their cogeners are contraindicated in advanced arteriosclerosis, symptomatic
cardiovascular disease, and moderate to severe hypertension and hyperthyroidism. They should not be used
to treat patients with hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy
to the sympathomimetic amines, or with glaucoma, a
history of agitated states, a history of drug abuse, or
during the 14 days following administration of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors.
Methylphenidate may lower the seizure threshold.
Benzphetamine is category X during pregnancy.
Diethylpropion is category B. Other anorexiants have

There have been reports that when used in children, methylphenidate and amphetamines may retard
growth. Although these reports have been questioned,
it may be suggested that the drugs not be administered
outside of school hours (because most children have
behavior problems in school), in order to permit full
stature to be attained.
The most common adverse effects of CNS stimulants are associated with their primary action. Typical
responses include overstimulation, dizziness, restlessness, and similar reactions. Rarely, hematologic reactions, including leukopenia, agranulocytosis, and
bone marrow depression have been reported.
Lowering of the seizure threshold has been noted
with most drugs in this class.

I Cephalosporins
Definition
Cephalosporins are medicines that kill bacteria or
prevent their growth.

Purpose
Cephalosporins are used to treat infections in different parts of the body—the ears, nose, throat, lungs,
sinuses, and skin, for example. Physicians may prescribe these drugs to treat pneumonia, strep throat,
staph infections, tonsillitis, bronchitis, and gonorrhea.
These drugs will not work for colds, flu, and other
infections caused by viruses.

Cephalosporins

KEY TERMS

Cephalosporins

Cephalosporins are a newer class of antibiotics
and often are seen as an alternative to penicillin for
many patients. Clinical studies continue to compare
this class of antibiotics to penicillin in combating
various infections. For example, a 2004 study showed
that cephalosporins are three times more effective
than penicillin for treating bacterial throat infections,
such as strep throat, in children. The authors recommended cephalosporin drugs as the first choices for
pediatricians.

Description
Examples of cephalosporins are cefaclor (Ceclor),
cefadroxil (Duricef), cefazolin (Ancef, Kefzol,
Zolicef), cefixime, (Suprax), cefoxitin (Mefoxin), cefprozil (Cefzil), ceftazidime (Ceptaz, Fortaz, Tazicef,
Tazideme), cefuroxime (Ceftin) and cephalexin
(Keflex). These medicines are available only with a
physician’s prescription. They are sold in tablet, capsule, liquid, and injectable forms.

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
cephalosporin. The physician who prescribed the drug
or the pharmacist who filled the prescription can
recommend the correct dosage.
Cephalosporins always should be taken exactly as
directed by the physician. Patients never should take
larger, smaller, more frequent, or less frequent doses.
The drug should be taken for exactly as long as directed, no more and no less. Patients should not save
some doses of the drug to take for future infections.
The medicine may not be right for other kinds of
infections, even if the symptoms are the same. In addition, patients should take all of the medicine to treat
the infection for which it was prescribed. The infection
may not clear up completely if too little medicine is
taken. Taking this medicine for too long, on the other
hand, may open the door to new infections that do not
respond to the drug.
Some cephalosporins work best when taken on an
empty stomach. Others should be taken after meals.
The physician who prescribed the medicine or the
pharmacist who filled the prescription can provide
instructions on how to take the medicine.

flushing, and other symptoms may result within 15–30
minutes and may last for several hours. Alcoholic beverages or other medicines that contain alcohol should
not be used while being treated with cephalosporins and
for several days after treatment ends.
Special conditions
People with certain medical conditions or who are
taking certain other medicines can have problems if they
take cephalosporins. Before taking these drugs, the
physician should be told about any of these conditions:
ALLERGIES. Severe allergic reactions to this medicine may occur. Anyone who is allergic to cephalosporins of any kind should not take other cephalosporins.
Anyone who is allergic to penicillin should check with a
physician before taking any cephalosporin. The physician should also be told about allergies to foods, dyes,
preservatives, or other substances.
DIABETES. Some cephalosporins may cause false
positive results on urine sugar tests for diabetes.
People with diabetes should check with their physicians to see if they need to adjust their medication or
their diets.
PHENYLKETONURIA. Oral suspensions of cefprozil
contain phenylalanine. People with phenylketonuria
(PKU) should consult a physician before taking this
medicine.
PREGNANCY. Women who are pregnant or who
may become pregnant should check with their physicians before using cephalosporins.
BREASTFEEDING. Cephalosporins may pass into
breast milk and may affect nursing babies. Women
who are breastfeeding and who need to take this medicine should check with their physicians. They may
need to stop breastfeeding until treatment is finished.
OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using
cephalosporins, people with any of these medical problems should make sure their physicians are aware of
their conditions:


History of stomach or intestinal problems, especially
colitis. Cephalosporins may cause colitis in some
people.



Kidney problems. The dose of cephalosporin may
need to be lowered.



Bleeding problems. Cephalosporins may increase the
chance of bleeding in people with a history of bleeding problems.



Liver disease. The dose of cephalosporin may need to
be lowered.

Interactions
Some cephalosporins cause diarrhea. Certain
diarrhea medicines, such as diphenoxylate-atropine
(Lomotil), may make the problem worse. A physician
should be consulted before taking any medicine for
diarrhea caused by taking cephalosporins.
Birth control pills may not work properly
when taken at the same time as cephalosporins. To
prevent pregnancy, other methods of birth control
should be used in addition to the pills while taking
cephalosporins.
Taking cephalosporins with certain other drugs
may increase the risk of excess bleeding. Among the
drugs that may have this effect when taken with cephalosporins are:

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy

I Cerebral amyloid angiopathy
Definition
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is also
known as congophilic angiopathy or cerebrovascular
amyloidosis. It is a disease of small blood vessels in the
brain in which deposits of amyloid protein in the vessel
walls may lead to stroke, brain hemorrhage, or dementia. Amyloid protein resembles a starch and is deposited in tissues during the course of certain chronic
diseases.

Description
CAA may affect patients over age 45, but is most
common in patients over age 65, and becomes more
common with increasing age. Men and women are
equally affected. In some cases, CAA is sporadic but
it may also be inherited as an autosomal dominant
condition (a form of inheritance in which only one
copy of a gene coding for a disease need be present
for that disease to be expressed; if either parent has the
disease, a child has a 50% chance of inheriting the
disease). CAA is responsible for 5–20% of brain
hemorrhage, and up to 30% of lobar hemorrhages
localized to one lobe of the brain. CAA may be
found during an autopsy in over one-third of persons
over age 60, even though they may not have had brain
hemorrhage, stroke, or other manifestations of the
disease during life. In Alzheimer’s disease, CAA is
more common than in the general population, and
may occur in more than 80% of patients over age 60.

Causes and symptoms
The cause of amyloid deposits in blood vessels in
the brain in sporadic CAA is not known. In hereditary
CAA, genetic defects, typically on chromosome 21,
allow accumulation of amyloid, a protein made up of
units called beta-pleated sheet fibrils. The fibrils tend
to clump together, so that the amyloid cannot be dissolved and builds up in the brain blood vessel walls.
One form of amyloid fibril subunit proteins is the
amyloid beta protein.
Different theories have been suggested for the
source of amyloid beta protein in the brain. The systemic theory suggests that amyloid beta protein in
the blood stream is deposited in blood vessels in the
brain, causing weakness in the blood vessel wall and
breakdown in the blood-brain barrier. Normally, the
blood-brain barrier keeps proteins and other large
molecules from escaping from the blood vessel to the
772

brain tissue. When there is breakdown of the bloodbrain barrier, amyloid beta protein leaks through the
blood vessel wall, and is deposited in the brain substance, where it forms an abnormal structure called a
neuritic plaque.
A second, more likely theory is that amyloid
fibrils that form amyloid beta protein are produced
by perivascular microglia, or support cells in contact
with the brain blood vessel wall. The third theory is
that the brain tissue gives rise to amyloid beta protein.
Both the nerve cells and the glia are known to produce
amyloid precursor protein, which increases with aging
and with cell stress.
Bleeding into the brain may occur as tiny blood
vessels carrying amyloid deposits become heavier and
more brittle, and are therefore more likely to burst
with minor trauma or with fluctuating blood pressure.
Aneurysms, or ballooning of the blood vessel wall,
may develop, and may also rupture as the stretched
wall becomes thinner and is under more pressure.
Amyloid deposits may destroy smooth muscle cells
or cause inflammation in the blood vessel wall. This
may also cause the blood vessel to break more easily.
The most common form of CAA is the sporadic
form associated with aging. This type of CAA usually
causes lobar hemorrhage, which may recur in different
lobes of the brain. The frontal lobe (behind the forehead) and parietal lobe (behind the frontal lobe) are
most often affected; the temporal lobe (near the temple) and occipital lobe (at the back of the brain) are
affected less often; and the cerebellum (under the occipital lobe) is rarely affected. Approximately 10–50%
of hemorrhages in sporadic CAA involve more than
one lobe.
Symptoms of lobar hemorrhage in CAA include
sudden onset of headache, neurologic symptoms such
as weakness, sensory loss, visual changes, or speech
problems, depending on which lobe is involved; and
decreased level of consciousness (a patient who is
difficult to arouse), nausea, and vomiting. Sporadic
CAA may be associated with symptoms unrelated to
lobar hemorrhage. Petechial hemorrhages (tiny
hemorrhages involving many small vessels) may produce recurrent, brief neurologic symptoms secondary
to seizures or decreased blood flow, or may produce
rapidly progressive dementia (loss of memory and
other brain functions) that worsens in distinct steps
rather than gradually. Over 40% of patients with
hemorrhage secondary to CAA also have dementia.
Genetic factors play a role in certain types of CAA
and in diseases associated with CAA:

Symptoms can include dementia, ataxia (problems

seizures, peripheral neuropathy (disease affecting the
nerves supplying the limbs), migraine, spinal cord problems, blindness, and deafness. Brain hemorrhage is
rare as the amyloid protein is deposited in blood vessels
in the eye and meninges (brain coverings), but not in
the brain itself. In Italian families with the disease,
patients may be affected as early as 20–30 years of age.

dominant with unknown gene defect(s), associated
with progressive dementia, spasticity, and ataxia.
Brain stem, spinal cord, and cerebellum all exhibit
amyloid deposits, but hemorrhage typically does not
occur.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis
As in most neurologic diseases, diagnosis is made
most often from the patient’s history, with careful
inquiry into family history and the patient’s onset
and pattern of symptoms, as well as neurologic examination. Brain computed tomography scan (CT) or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may identify
lobar hemorrhage, stroke, or petechial hemorrhages,
and are important in excluding arteriovenous malformation, brain tumor, or other causes of hemorrhage.
Angiography (x-ray study of the interior of blood vessels and the heart) is not helpful in diagnosis of CAA,
but may be needed to exclude aneurysm. Brain biopsy
(surgical removal of a small piece of brain tissue) may
show characteristic amyloid deposits, but is rarely
performed, as the risk may not be justifiable in the
absence of effective treatment for CAA. If diagnosis is
uncertain, biopsy may be needed to rule out conditions
which are potentially treatable. Definite diagnosis
requires microscopic examination of brain tissue,
either at biopsy, at autopsy, or at surgery when brain
hemorrhage is drained. Lumbar puncture to examine
cerebrospinal fluid proteins may show characteristic
abnormalities, but is not part of the routine exam. In
familial forms, genetic analysis may be helpful.
CAA with hemorrhage must be distinguished from
other types of brain hemorrhage. In CAA, hemorrhage
typically occurs in the lobar region, often ruptures
into the subarachnoid space between the brain and its
coverings, and occurs at night. In hemorrhage related
to high blood pressure, hemorrhage is usually deeper
within the brain, ruptures into the ventricles or cavities
deep inside the brain, and occurs during daytime
activities. Other causes of brain hemorrhage are arteriovenous malformations, trauma, aneurysms, bleeding
into a brain tumor, vasculitis (inflammation of blood
vessels), or bleeding disorders.

Treatment
Although there is no effective treatment for the
underlying disease process of CAA, measures can be
taken to prevent brain hemorrhage in patients diagnosed with CAA. High blood pressure should be treated aggressively, and even normal blood pressure can
be lowered as much as tolerated without side effects
from medications. Blood thinners such as Coumadin,
antiplatelet agents such as aspirin, or medications
designed to dissolve blood clots may cause hemorrhage
in patients with CAA, and should be avoided if possible. If these medications are required for other conditions, such as heart disease, the potential benefits must
be carefully weighed against the increased risks.

Cerebral aneurysm

KEY TERMS
Amyloid—Amyloid protein resembles a starch and
is deposited in tissues during the course of certain
chronic diseases.
Ataxia—Problems with coordination and walking.
Autosomal dominant—A form of inheritance in
which only one copy of a gene coding for a disease
need be present for that disease to be expressed. If
either parent has the disease, a child has a 50%
chance of inheriting the disease.
Chromosome—A cellular structure containing
genetic information in the form of DNA.
Dementia—Loss of memory and other higher functions, such as thinking or speech, lasting six months
or more.
Hemorrhage—Bleeding, or escape of blood
through ruptured or unruptured blood vessel walls.
Lobar hemorrhage—Bleeding into one of the lobes
of the brain.
Seizure—Epileptic convulsion, fit, or attack.
Sporadic—A form of disease found in persons without a family history of the disease.
Spasticity—Limb stiffness related to disease of the
brain or spinal cord.
Stroke—Sudden neurological deficit related to
impaired blood supply to the brain.

Seizures, or recurrent neurologic symptoms
thought to be seizures, should be treated with antiepileptic drugs, although Depakote (sodium valproate) should be avoided because of its antiplatelet
effect. Anti-epileptic drugs are sometimes given to
patients with large lobar hemorrhage in an attempt
to prevent seizures, although the benefit of this is
unclear.
Once brain hemorrhage has occurred, the patient
should be admitted to a hospital (ICU) for neurologic
monitoring and control of increased pressure within
the brain, blood pressure control, and supportive
medical care. Antiplatelet agents and blood thinners
should be discontinued and their effects reversed, if
possible. Surgery may be needed to remove brain
hemorrhage, although bleeding during surgery may
be difficult to control.
CAA may be rarely associated with cerebral vasculitis, or inflammation of the blood vessel walls. In
774

these cases treatment with steroids or immune system
suppressants may be helpful. Without tissue examination, vasculitis cannot be diagnosed reliably, and
probably coexists with CAA too rarely to justify steroid treatment in most cases.

Prognosis
Since CAA is associated with progressive blood
vessel degeneration, and since there is no effective
treatment, most patients have a poor prognosis.
Aggressive neurosurgical management allows
increased survival following lobar hemorrhage, but
as of 1998, 20–90% of patients die from the first
hemorrhage or its complications, which include progression of hemorrhage, brain edema (swelling) with
herniation (downward pressure on vital brain structures), seizures, and infections such as pneumonia.
Many survivors have persistent neurologic deficits
related to the brain lobe affected by hemorrhage, and
are at risk for additional hemorrhages, seizures, and
dementia. Prognosis is worse in patients who are older,
or who have larger hemorrhages or recurrent hemorrhages within a short time.

I Cerebral aneurysm
Definition
A cerebral aneurysm occurs at a weak point in the
wall of a blood vessel (artery) that supplies blood to
the brain. Because of the flaw, the artery wall bulges
outward and fills with blood. This bulge is called an
aneurysm. An aneurysm can rupture, spilling blood
into the surrounding body tissue. A ruptured cerebral
aneurysm can cause permanent brain damage, disability, or death.

Description
A cerebral aneurysm can occur anywhere in the
brain. Aneurysms can have several shapes. The saccular aneurysm, once called a berry aneurysm, resembles
a piece of fruit dangling from a branch. Saccular
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The greatest danger of aneurysms is rupture.
Approximately 50–75% of stricken people survive an
aneurysmal rupture. A ruptured aneurysm spills blood
into the brain or into the fluid-filled area that surrounds the brain tissue. Bleeding into this area, called
the subarachnoid space, is referred to as subarachnoid
hemorrhage (SAH). About 25,000 people suffer a SAH
each year. It is estimated that people with unruptured
aneurysm have an annual 1–2% risk of hemorrhage.
Under age 40, more men experience SAH. After age
40, more women than men are affected.
Most people who have suffered a SAH from a
ruptured aneurysm did not know that the aneurysm
even existed. Based on autopsy studies, medical
researchers estimate that 1–5% of the population has
some type of cerebral aneurysm. Aneurysms rarely
occur in the very young or the very old; about 60%
of aneurysms are diagnosed in people between ages 40
and 65.
Some aneurysms may have a genetic link and run
in families. The genetic link has not been completely
proven and a pattern of inheritance has not been
determined. Some studies seem to show that firstdegree relatives of people who suffered aneurysmal
SAH are more likely to have aneurysms themselves.
These studies reported that such immediate family
members were four times more likely to have aneurysms than the general population. Other studies do
not confirm these findings. Better evidence links
aneurysms to certain rare diseases of the connective
tissue. These diseases include Marfan syndrome, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and
fibromuscular dysplasia. Polycystic kidney disease is
also associated with cerebral aneurysms.
These diseases are also associated with an
increased risk of aneurysmal rupture. Certain other
conditions raise the risk of rupture, too. Most aneurysms that rupture are a half-inch or larger in diameter.
Size is not the only factor, however, because smaller
aneurysms also rupture. Cigarette smoking, excessive
alcohol consumption, and recreational drug use (for
example, use of cocaine) have been linked with an
increased risk. The role, if any, of high blood pressure
has not been determined. Some studies have implicated high blood pressure in aneurysm formation
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

and rupture, but people with normal blood pressure
also experience aneurysms and SAHs. High blood
pressure may be a risk factor but not the most important one. Pregnancy, labor, and delivery also seem to
increase the possibility that an aneurysm might rupture, but not all doctors agree. Physical exertion and
use of oral contraceptives are not suspected causes for
aneurysmal rupture.

Causes and symptoms
Cerebral aneurysms can be caused by brain
trauma, infection, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), or abnormal rapid cell growth (neoplastic
disease), but most seem to arise from a congenital, or
developmental, defect. These congenital aneurysms
occur more frequently in women. Whatever the cause
may be, the inner wall of the blood vessel is abnormally thin and the pressure of the blood flow causes an
aneurysm to form.
Most aneurysms go unnoticed until they rupture.
However, 10–15% of unruptured cerebral aneurysms
are found because of their size or their location.
Common warning signs include symptoms that affect
only one eye, such as an enlarged pupil, a drooping
eyelid, or pain above or behind the eye. Other symptoms are a localized headache, unsteady gait, a temporary problem with sight, double vision, or numbness
in the face.
Some aneurysms bleed occasionally without rupturing. Symptoms of such an aneurysm develop gradually. The symptoms include headache, nausea,
vomiting, neck pain, black-outs, ringing in the ears,
dizziness, or seeing spots.
Eighty to ninety percent of aneurysms are not
diagnosed until after they have ruptured. Rupture is
not always a sudden event. Nearly 50% of patients
who have aneurysmal SAHs also experience ‘‘the
warning leak phenomenon.’’ Persons with warning
leak symptoms have sudden, atypical headaches that
occur days or weeks before the actual rupture. These
headaches are referred to as sentinel headaches.
Nausea, vomiting, and dizziness may accompany sentinel headaches. Unfortunately, these symptoms can
be confused with tension headaches or migraines, and
treatment can be delayed until rupture occurs.
When an aneurysm ruptures, most victims experience a sudden, extremely severe headache. This headache is typically described as the worst headache of the
victim’s life. Nausea and vomiting commonly accompany the headache. The person may experience a short
loss of consciousness or prolonged coma. Other
775

Cerebral aneurysm

aneurysms are usually found at a branch in the blood
vessel where they balloon out by a thin neck. Saccular
cerebral aneurysms most often occur at the branch
points of large arteries at the base of the brain.
Aneurysms may also take the form of a bulge in one
wall of the artery–a lateral aneurysm–or a widening of
the entire artery–a fusiform aneurysm.

common signs of a SAH include a stiff neck, fever, and
a sensitivity to light. About 25% of victims experience
neurological problems linked to specific areas of the
brain, swelling of the brain due to fluid accumulation
(hydrocephalus), or seizure.

Diagnosis
Based on the clinical symptoms, a doctor will run
several tests to confirm an aneurysm or an SAH.
A computed tomography scan (CT) of the head is the
initial procedure. A magnetic resonance imaging test
(MRI) may be done instead of a CT scan. MRI, however, is not as sensitive as CT for detecting subarachnoid blood. A CT scan can determine whether there has
been a hemorrhage and can assist in pinpointing the
location of the aneurysm. The scan is most useful when
it is done within 72 hours of the rupture. Later scans
may miss the signs of hemorrhage.
If the CT scan is negative for a hemorrhage or
provides an unclear diagnosis, the doctor will order a
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, also called a lumbar
puncture. In this procedure, a small amount of
776

cerebrospinal fluid is removed from the lower back
and examined for traces of blood and blood-breakdown
products. If this test is positive, cerebral angiography is
used to map the brain’s blood vessels and the damaged
area. The angiography is done to pinpoint the aneurysm’s location. About 15% of people who experience
SAH have more than one aneurysm. For this reason,
angiography should include both the common carotid
artery that feeds the front of the brain and the vertebral
artery that feeds the base of the brain. Occasionally, the
angiography fails to find the aneurysm and must be
repeated. If seizures occur, electroencephalography
(EEG) may be used to measure the electrical activity of
the brain.

Treatment
Unruptured aneurysm
If an aneurysm has not ruptured and is not causing any symptoms, it may be left untreated. Because
there is a 1–2% chance of rupture per year, the cumulative risk over a number of years may justify surgical
treatment. However, if the aneurysm is small or in a
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Ruptured aneurysm
The primary treatment for a ruptured aneurysm
involves stabilizing the victim’s condition, treating the
immediate symptoms, and promptly assessing further
treatment options, especially surgical procedures. The
patient may require mechanical ventilation, oxygen,
and fluids. Medications may be given to prevent major
secondary complications such as seizures, rebleeding,
and vasospasm (narrowing of the affected blood vessel). Vasospasm decreases blood flow to the brain and
causes the death of nerve cells. A drug such as nimodipine (Nimotop) may help prevent vasospasm by
relaxing the smooth muscle tissue of the arteries.
Even with treatment, however, vasospasm may cause
stroke or death.
To prevent further hemorrhage from the aneurysm, it must be removed from circulation. In general,
surgical procedures should be performed as soon as
possible to prevent rebleeding. The chances that aneurysm will rebleed are greatest in the first 24 hours, and
vasospasm usually does not occur until 72 hours or
more after rupture. If the patient is in poor condition
or if there is vasospasm or other complication, surgical
procedures may be delayed. The preferred surgical
method is a clip ligation in which a clip is placed around
the base of the aneurysm to block it off from circulation. Surgical coating, wrapping, or trapping of the
aneurysm may also be performed. These procedures
do not completely remove the aneurysm from circulation, however, and there is some risk that it may rebleed
in the future. Newer techniques that look promising
include balloon embolization, a procedure that blocks
the aneurysm with an inflatable membrane introduced
by means of a catheter inserted through the artery.

Prognosis
An unruptured aneurysm may not cause any
symptoms over an entire lifetime. Surgical clip ligation
will ensure that it won’t rupture, but it may be better to
leave the aneurysm alone in some cases. Familial cerebral aneurysms may rupture earlier than those without
a genetic link.
The outlook is not as good for a person who
suffers a ruptured aneurysm. Fifteen to twenty-five

I Cerebral palsy
Definition
Cerebral palsy (CP) is the term used for a group of
nonprogressive disorders of movement and posture
caused by abnormal development of, or damage to,
motor control centers of the brain. CP is caused by
events before, during, or after birth. The abnormalities
of muscle control that define CP are often accompanied by other neurological and physical abnormalities.

Description
Voluntary movement (walking, grasping, chewing, etc.) is primarily accomplished using muscles
that are attached to bones, known as the skeletal
muscles. Control of the skeletal muscles originates in
the cerebral cortex, the largest portion of the brain.
Palsy means paralysis, but may also be used to
describe uncontrolled muscle movement. Therefore,
cerebral palsy encompasses any disorder of abnormal
778

movement and paralysis caused by abnormal function
of the cerebral cortex. In truth, however, CP does not
include conditions due to progressive disease or degeneration of the brain. For this reason, CP is also
referred to as static (nonprogressive) encephalopathy
(disease of the brain). Also excluded from CP are any
disorders of muscle control that arise in the muscles
themselves and/or in the peripheral nervous system
(nerves outside the brain and spinal cord).
CP is not a specific diagnosis, but is more accurately considered a description of a broad but defined
group of neurological and physical problems.
The symptoms of CP and their severity are quite
variable. Those with CP may have only minor difficulty with fine motor skills, such as grasping and
manipulating items with their hands. A severe form
of CP could involve significant muscle problems in all
four limbs, mental retardation, seizures, and difficulties with vision, speech, and hearing.
Muscles that receive defective messages from the
brain may be constantly contracted and tight (spastic),
exhibit involuntary writhing movements (athetosis),
or have difficulty with voluntary movement (dyskinesia). There can also be a lack of balance and coordination with unsteady movements (ataxia). A combination
of any of these problems may also occur. Spastic CP
and mixed CP constitute the majority of cases. Effects
on the muscles can range from mild weakness or partial
paralysis (paresis), to complete loss of voluntary control of a muscle or group of muscles (plegia). CP is also
designated by the number of limbs affected. For
instance, affected muscles in one limb is monoplegia,
both arms or both legs is diplegia, both limbs on one
side of the body is hemiplegia, and in all four limbs is
quadriplegia. Muscles of the trunk, neck, and head may
be affected as well.
CP can be caused by a number of different
mechanisms at various times—from several weeks
after conception, through birth, to early childhood.
For many years, it was accepted that most cases of
CP were due to brain injuries received during a traumatic birth, known as birth asphyxia. However, extensive research in the 1980s showed that only 5–10%
of CP can be attributed to birth trauma. Other possible causes include abnormal development of the
brain, prenatal factors that directly or indirectly
damage neurons in the developing brain, premature
birth, and brain injuries that occur in the first few
years of life.
Advances in the medical care of premature infants
in the last 20 years have dramatically increased the rate
of survival of these fragile newborns. However, as
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Two factors are involved in the risk for CP associated with prematurity. First, premature babies are at
higher risk for various CP-associated medical complications, such as intracerebral hemorrhage, infection,
and difficulty in breathing, to name a few. Second, the
onset of premature labor may be induced, in part, by
complications that have already caused neurologic
damage in the fetus. A combination of both factors
almost certainly plays a role in some cases of CP. The
tendency toward premature delivery runs in families,
but the genetic mechanisms are far from clear.
An increase in multiple pregnancies in recent years,
especially in the United States, is blamed on the
increased use of fertility drugs. As the number of fetuses
in a pregnancy increases, the risks for abnormal development and premature delivery also increase. Children
from twin pregnancies have four times the risk of
developing CP as children from singleton pregnancies,
owing to the fact that more twin pregnancies are delivered prematurely. The risk for CP in a child of triplets
is up to 18 times greater. Furthermore, recent evidence
suggests that a baby from a pregnancy in which its
twin died before birth is at increased risk for CP.
Approximately 500,000 children and adults in the
United States have CP, and it is newly diagnosed
in about 6,000 infants and young children each year.
The incidence of CP has not changed much in the last
20–30 years. Ironically, while advances in medicine
have decreased the incidence from some causes—Rh
disease for example—they have increased it from
others, notably, prematurity and multiple pregnancies. No particular ethnic groups seem to be at higher
risk for CP. However, people of disadvantaged background are at higher risk due to poorer access to
proper prenatal care and advanced medical services.

Causes and symptoms
As noted, CP has many causes, making a discussion of the genetics of CP complicated. A number of
hereditary/genetic syndromes have signs and symptoms similar to CP, but usually also have problems
not typical of CP. Put another way, some hereditary
conditions ‘‘mimic’’ CP. Isolated CP, meaning CP that
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

is not a part of some other syndrome or disorder, is
usually not inherited.
It might be possible to group the causes of CP into
those that are genetic and those that are non-genetic,
but most would fall somewhere in between. Grouping
causes into those that occur during pregnancy
(prenatal), those that happen around the time of
birth (perinatal), and those that occur after birth
(postnatal), is preferable. CP related to premature
birth and multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.,
not ‘‘many pregnancies’’) is somewhat different and
considered separately.
Prenatal causes
Although much has been learned about human
embryology in the last few decades, a great deal
remains unknown. Studying prenatal human development is difficult because the embryo and fetus develop in a closed environment—the mother’s womb.
However, the relatively recent development of a number of prenatal tests has opened a window on the
process. Add to that more accurate and complete
evaluations of newborns, especially those with problems, and a clearer picture of what can go wrong
before birth is possible.
The complicated process of brain development
before birth is susceptible to many chance errors that
can result in abnormalities of varying degrees. Some of
these errors will result in structural anomalies of the
brain, while others may cause undetectable, but significant, abnormalities in how the cerebral cortex is
‘‘wired.’’ An abnormality in structure or wiring is
sometimes hereditary, but is most often due to chance,
or a cause unknown at this time. Whether and how
much genetics played a role in a particular brain
abnormality depends to some degree on the type of
anomaly and the form of CP it causes.
Several maternal-fetal infections are known to
increase the risk for CP, including rubella (German
measles, now rare in the United States), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and toxoplasmosis. Each of these infections is considered a risk to the fetus only if the mother
contracts it for the first time during that pregnancy.
Even in those cases, though, most babies will be born
normal. Most women are immune to all three infections by the time they reach childbearing age, but a
woman’s immune status can be determined using the
so-called TORCH (for Toxoplasmosis, Rubella,
Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes) test before or during
pregnancy.
Reserchers continue to study the role of perinatal
infection in development of cerebral palsy. New
779

Cerebral palsy

gestational age at delivery and birth weight of a baby
decrease, the risk for CP dramatically increases.
A term pregnancy is delivered at 37–41 weeks gestation.
The risk for CP in a preterm infant (32–37 weeks) is
increased about five-fold over the risk for an infant
born at term. Survivors of extremely preterm births
(less than 28 weeks) face as much as a 50-fold increase
in risk. About 50% of all cases of CP now being diagnosed are in children who were born prematurely.

Cerebral palsy

evidence in 2004 linked inflammatory cytokines to
possible cerebral injury that could lead to CP.
Scientists suggested new research with intravenous
immunoglobulin to limit inflammatory damage.
Just as a stroke can cause neurologic damage in an
adult, so too can this type of event occur in the fetus.
A burst blood vessel in the brain followed by uncontrolled bleeding (coagulopathy), known as intracerebral hemorrhage, could cause a fetal stroke, or a
cerebral blood vessel could be obstructed by a clot
(embolism). Infants who later develop CP, along with
their mothers, are more likely than other motherinfant pairs to test positive for factors that put them
at increased risk for bleeding episodes or blood clots.
Some coagulation disorders are strictly hereditary, but
most have a more complicated basis.
A teratogen is any substance to which a woman
is exposed that has the potential to harm the embryo
or fetus. Links between a drug or other chemical
exposure during pregnancy and a risk for CP are
difficult to prove. However, any substance that
might affect fetal brain development, directly or indirectly, could increase the risk for CP. Furthermore, any
substance that increases the risk for premature delivery and low birth weight, such as alcohol, tobacco, or
cocaine, among others, might indirectly increase the
risk for CP.
The fetus receives all nutrients and oxygen from
blood that circulates through the placenta. Therefore,
anything that interferes with normal placental function
might adversely affect development of the fetus, including the brain, or might increase the risk for premature
delivery. Structural abnormalities of the placenta, premature detachment of the placenta from the uterine
wall (abruption), and placental infections (chorioamnionitis) are thought to pose some risk for CP.
Certain conditions in the mother during pregnancy might pose a risk to fetal development leading
to CP. Women with autoimmune anti-thyroid or
anti-phospholipid (APA) antibodies are at slightly
increased risk for CP in their children. A potentially
important clue uncovered recently points toward high
levels of cytokines in the maternal and fetal circulation
as a possible risk for CP. Cytokines are proteins associated with inflammation, such as from infection or
autoimmune disorders, and they may be toxic to neurons in the fetal brain. More research is needed to
determine the exact relationship, if any, between high
levels of cytokines in pregnancy and CP. A woman has
some risk of developing the same complications in
more than one pregnancy, slightly increasing the risk
for more than one child with CP.
780

Serious physical trauma to the mother during
pregnancy could result in direct trauma to the fetus
as well, or injuries to the mother could compromise the
availability of nutrients and oxygen to the developing
fetal brain.
Perinatal causes
Birth asphyxia significant enough to result in CP
is now uncommon in developed countries. Tight
nuchal cord (umbilical cord around the baby’s neck)
and prolapsed cord (cord delivered before the baby)
are possible causes of birth asphyxia, as are bleeding
and other complications associated with placental
abruption and placenta previa (placenta lying over the
cervix).
Infection in the mother is sometimes not passed to
the fetus through the placenta, but is transmitted to
the baby during delivery. Any such infection that
results in serious illness in the newborn has the potential to produce some neurological damage.
Postnatal causes
The remaining 15% of CP is due to neurologic
injury sustained after birth. CP that has a postnatal
cause is sometimes referred to as acquired CP, but this
is only accurate for those cases caused by infection or
trauma.
Incompatibility between the Rh blood types of
mother and child (mother Rh negative, baby Rh positive) can result in severe anemia in the baby (erythroblastosis fetalis). This may lead to other complications,
including severe jaundice, which can cause CP. Rh
disease in the newborn is now rare in developed countries due to routine screening of maternal blood type
and treatment of pregnancies at risk. The routine,
effective treatment of jaundice due to other causes
has also made it an infrequent cause of CP in developed countries. Rh blood type poses a risk for recurrence of Rh disease if treatment is not provided.
Serious infections that affect the brain directly,
such as meningitis and encephalitis, may cause irreversible damage to the brain, leading to CP. A seizure
disorder early in life may cause CP, or may be the
product of a hidden problem that causes CP in addition to seizures. Unexplained (idiopathic) seizures
are hereditary in only a small percentage of cases.
Although rare in infants born healthy at or near
term, intracerebral hemorrhage and brain embolism,
like fetal stroke, are sometimes genetic.

By definition, the defect in cerebral function causing CP is nonprogressive. However, the symptoms
of CP often change over time. Most of the symptoms
of CP relate in some way to the abnormal control of
muscles. To review, CP is categorized first by the type
of movement/postural disturbance(s) present, then by
a description of which limbs are affected, and finally
by the severity of motor impairment. For example,
spastic diplegia refers to continuously tight muscles
that have no voluntary control in both legs, while
athetoid quadraparesis describes uncontrolled writhing movements and muscle weakness in all four
limbs. These three-part descriptions are helpful in
providing a general picture, but cannot give a complete description of any one person with CP. In addition, the various ‘‘forms’’ of CP do not occur with
equal frequency—spastic diplegia is seen in more individuals than is athetoid quadraparesis. CP can also be
loosely categorized as mild, moderate, or severe, but
these are very subjective terms with no firm boundaries between them.



speech impairment (dysarthria)



abnormal sensation and perception

A muscle that is tensed and contracted is hypertonic, while excessively loose muscles are hypotonic.
Spastic, hypertonic muscles can cause serious orthopedic problems, including scoliosis (spine curvature),
hip dislocation, or contractures. A contracture
is shortening of a muscle, aided sometimes by a
weak-opposing force from a neighboring muscle.
Contractures may become permanent, or ‘‘fixed,’’
without some sort of intervention. Fixed contractures
may cause postural abnormalities in the affected
limbs. Clenched fists and contracted feet (equinus or
equinovarus) are common in people with CP.
Spasticity in the thighs causes them to turn in and
cross at the knees, resulting in an unusual method of
walking known as a ‘‘scissors gait.’’ Any of the joints
in the limbs may be stiff (immobilized) due to spasticity of the attached muscles.
Athetosis and dyskinesia often occur with spasticity, but do not often occur alone. The same is true of
ataxia. It is important to remember that ‘‘mild CP’’ or
‘‘severe CP’’ refers not only to the number of symptoms present, but also to the level of involvement of
any particular class of symptoms.
Mechanisms that can cause CP are not always
restricted to motor-control areas of the brain. Other
neurologically based symptoms may include:
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Cerebral palsy

drowning/suffocation, might cause CP. Likewise, ingestion of a toxic substance such as lead, mercury, poisons,
or certain chemicals could cause neurological damage.
Accidental overdose of certain medications might also
cause similar damage to the central nervous system.

These problems may have a greater impact on a
child’s life than the physical impairments of CP,
although not all children with CP are affected by
other problems. Many infants and children with CP
have growth impairment. About one-third of individuals with CP have moderate-to-severe mental retardation, one-third have mild mental retardation, and
one-third have normal intelligence.

Diagnosis
The signs of CP are not usually noticeable at birth.
Children normally progress through a predictable set
of developmental milestones through the first 18
months of life. Children with CP, however, tend to
develop these skills more slowly because of their motor
impairments, and delays in reaching milestones are
usually the first symptoms of CP. Babies with more
severe cases of CP are usually diagnosed earlier than
others.
Selected developmental milestones, and the ages
for normally acquiring them, are given below. If a
child does not acquire the skill by the age shown in
parentheses, there is some cause for concern.

Children do not consistently favor one hand over
the other before 12–18 months, and doing so may be a
sign that the child has difficulty using the other hand.
This same preference for one side of the body may
show up as asymmetric crawling or, later on, favoring
one leg while climbing stairs.
781

Cerebral palsy

It must be remembered that children normally
progress at somewhat different rates, and slow beginning accomplishment is often followed by normal
development. Other causes for developmental delay—
some benign, some serious—should be excluded
before considering CP as the answer. CP is nonprogressive, so continued loss of previously acquired milestones indicates that CP is not the cause of the
problem.
No one test is diagnostic for CP, but certain factors increase suspicion. The Apgar score measures a
baby’s condition immediately after birth. Babies that
have low Apgar scores are at increased risk for CP.
Presence of abnormal muscle tone or movements may
indicate CP, as may the persistence of infantile
reflexes. Imaging of the brain using ultrasound,
x rays, MRI, and/or CT scans may reveal a structural
anomaly. Some brain lesions associated with CP
include scarring, cysts, expansion of the cerebral ventricles (hydrocephalus), periventricular leukomalacia
(an abnormality of the area surrounding the ventricles), areas of dead tissue (necrosis), and evidence of
an intracerebral hemorrhage or blood clot. Blood and
urine biochemical tests, as well as genetic tests, may be
used to rule out other possible causes, including muscle and peripheral nerve diseases, mitochondrial and
metabolic diseases, and other inherited disorders.
Evaluations by a pediatric developmental specialist
and a geneticist may be of benefit.

Treatment
Cerebral palsy cannot be cured, but many of the
disabilities it causes can be managed through planning
and timely care. Treatment for a child with CP
depends on the severity, nature, and location of the
primary muscular symptoms, as well as any associated
problems that might be present. Optimal care of a
child with mild CP may involve regular interaction
with only a physical therapist and occupational therapist, whereas care for a more severely affected child
may include visits to multiple medical specialists
throughout life. With proper treatment and an effective plan, most people with CP can lead productive,
happy lives.
Therapy
Spasticity, muscle weakness, coordination, ataxia,
and scoliosis are all significant impairments that
affect the posture and mobility of a person with CP.
Physical and occupational therapists work with the
patient, and the family, to maximize the ability to
move affected limbs, develop normal motor patterns,
782

and maintain posture. ‘‘Assistive technology,’’ things
such as wheelchairs, walkers, shoe inserts, crutches,
and braces, are often required. A speech therapist,
and high-tech aids such as computer-controlled
communication devices, can make a tremendous
difference in the life of those who have speech
impairments. A new experimental physical therapy
treatment was tested on children in 2004 that often
is used on adults who have had strokes. Called
constraint-induced movement therapy, it consists of
placing the child’s stronger arm in a case for three
weeks and giving him or her 21 straight days to
retrain the weaker arm.
Medications
Before fixed contractures develop, muscle-relaxant drugs such as diazepam (Valium), dantrolene
(Dantrium), and baclofen (Lioresal) may be prescribed. Botulinum toxin (Botox), a newer and highly
effective treatment, is injected directly into the affected
muscles. Alcohol or phenol injections into the nerve
controlling the muscle are another option. Multiple
medications are available to control seizures, and
athetosis can be treated using medications such as
trihexyphenidyl HCl (Artane) and benztropine
(Cogentin).
Surgery
Fixed contractures are usually treated with either
serial casting or surgery. The most commonly used
surgical procedures are tenotomy, tendon transfer,
and dorsal rhizotomy. In tenotomy, tendons of the
affected muscle are cut and the limb is cast in a more
normal position while the tendon regrows. Alternatively,
tendon transfer involves cutting and reattaching a
tendon at a different point on the bone to enhance
the length and function of the muscle. A neurosurgeon
performing dorsal rhizotomy carefully cuts selected
nerve roots in the spinal cord to prevent them from
stimulating the spastic muscles. Neurosurgical techniques in the brain such as implanting tiny electrodes
directly into the cerebellum, or cutting a portion of the
hypothalamus, have very specific uses and have had
mixed results.
Education
Parents of a child newly diagnosed with CP are
not likely to have the necessary expertise to coordinate
the full range of care their child will need. Although
knowledgeable and caring medical professionals are
indispensable for developing a care plan, a potentially
more important source of information and advice is

Tenotomy—A surgical procedure that cuts the tendon of a contracted muscle to allow lengthening.

Cerebral palsy can affect every stage of maturation, from childhood through adolescence to adulthood. At each stage, those with CP, along with their
caregivers, must strive to achieve and maintain the
fullest range of experiences and education consistent
with their abilities. The advice and intervention of
various professionals remains crucial for many people
with CP. Although CP itself is not considered a terminal disorder, it can affect a person’s lifespan by
increasing the risk for certain medical problems.
People with mild cerebral palsy may have near-normal
lifespans, but the lifespan of those with more severe
forms may be shortened. However, more than 90% of
infants with CP survive into adulthood.
The cause of most cases of CP remains unknown,
but it has become clear in recent years that birth
difficulties are not to blame in most cases. Rather,
developmental problems before birth, usually
unknown and generally undiagnosable, are responsible for most cases. The rate of survival for preterm
infants has leveled off in recent years, and methods to
improve the long-term health of these at-risk babies
are now being sought. Current research is also focusing on the possible benefits of recognizing and treating
coagulopathies and inflammatory disorders in the prenatal and perinatal periods. The use of magnesium
sulfate in pregnant women with preeclampsia or threatened preterm delivery may reduce the risk of CP in
very preterm infants. Finally, the risk of CP can be
decreased through good maternal nutrition, avoidance
of drugs and alcohol during pregnancy, and prevention or prompt treatment of infections.

fluid (CSF)
I Cerebrospinal
analysis
Definition
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is a laboratory
test to examine a sample of the fluid surrounding the
brain and spinal cord. This fluid is a clear, watery liquid
that protects the central nervous system from injury
and cushions it from the surrounding bone structure.
It contains a variety of substances, particularly glucose
(sugar), protein, and white blood cells from the immune
system. The fluid is withdrawn through a needle in a
procedure called a lumbar puncture.
784

Purpose
The purpose of a CSF analysis is to diagnose
medical disorders that affect the central nervous system. Some of these conditions include:


viral and bacterial infections, such as meningitis,
West Nile virus, herpes virus, and encephalitis



tumors or cancers of the nervous system



syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease



bleeding (hemorrhaging) around the brain and spinal
cord



multiple sclerosis, a disease that affects the myelin
coating of the nerve fibers of the brain and spinal cord



Guillain-Barr syndrome, an inflammation of the
nerves.



Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. The levels of two
substances known as amyloid beta (1–42) and phosphorylated tau in CSF appear to be useful diagnostic
markers for early-onset Alzheimer’s.

CSF analysis is also used in forensic investigations
to identify the presence of illicit drugs (e. g., heroin) or
poisons in the bodies of murder, accidental overdose,
or suicide victims.

Precautions
In some circumstances, a lumbar puncture to withdraw a small amount of CSF for analysis may lead to
serious complications. Lumbar puncture should be
performed only with extreme caution, and only if the
benefits are thought to outweigh the risks, in certain
conditions. For example, in people who have blood
clotting (coagulation) or bleeding disorders, lumbar
puncture can cause bleeding that can compress the
spinal cord. If there is a large brain tumor or other
mass, removal of CSF can cause the brain to droop
down within the skull cavity (herniate), compressing
the brain stem and other vital structures, and leading to
irreversible brain damage or death. These problems are
easily avoided by checking blood coagulation through
a blood test and by doing a computed tomography scan
(CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan before
attempting the lumbar puncture. In addition, a lumbar
puncture procedure should never be performed at the
site of a localized skin infection on the lower back
because the infection may be introduced into the CSF
and may spread to the brain or spinal cord.

Description
The procedure to remove cerebrospinal fluid is
called a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, because the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

A lumbar puncture takes about 30 minutes.
Patients can undergo the test in a doctor’s office,
laboratory, or outpatient hospital setting. Sometimes
it requires an inpatient hospital stay. If the patient has
spinal arthritis, is extremely uncooperative, or obese,
it may be necessary to introduce the spinal needle
using x-ray guidance.
In order to get an accurate sample of cerebrospinal fluid, it is critical that a patient is in the proper
position. The spine must be curved to allow as much
space as possible between the lower vertebrae, or
bones of the back, for the doctor to insert a lumbar
puncture needle between the vertebrae and withdraw a
small amount of fluid. The most common position is
for the patient to lie on his or her side with the back at
the edge of the exam table, head and chin bent down,
knees drawn up to the chest, and arms clasped around
the knees. (Small infants and people who are obese
may need to curve their spines in a sitting position.)
People should talk to their doctor if they have any
questions about their position because it is important
to be comfortable and to remain still during the entire
procedure. In fact, the doctor will explain the procedure to the patient (or guardian) so that the patient
can agree in writing to have it done (informed consent). If the patient is anxious or uncooperative, a
short-acting sedative may be given.
During a lumbar puncture, the doctor drapes the
back with a sterile covering that has an opening over
the puncture site and cleans the skin surface with an
antiseptic solution. Patients receive a local anesthetic
to minimize any pain in the lower back.
The doctor inserts a hollow, thin needle in the
space between two vertebrae of the lower back and
slowly advances it toward the spine. A steady flow of
clear cerebrospinal fluid, normally the color of water,
will begin to fill the needle as soon as it enters the
spinal canal. The doctor measures the cerebrospinal
fluid pressure with a special instrument called a manometer and withdraws several vials of fluid for laboratory analysis. The amount of fluid collected depends
on the type and number of tests needed to diagnose a
particular medical disorder.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

In some cases, the doctor must remove and reposition the needle. This occurs when there is not an even
flow of fluid, the needle hits bone or a blood vessel, or
the patient reports sharp, unusual pain.

Preparation
Patients can go about their normal activities before
a lumbar puncture. Experts recommend that patients
relax before the procedure to release any muscle tension, since the lumbar puncture needle must pass
through muscle tissue before it reaches the spinal
canal. A patient’s level of relaxation before and during
the procedure plays a critical role in the test’s success.

Aftercare
After the procedure, the doctor covers the site of
the puncture with a sterile bandage. Patients must avoid
sitting or standing and remain lying down for as long as
six hours after the lumbar puncture. They should also
drink plenty of fluid to help prevent lumbar puncture
headache, which is discussed in the next section.

Risks
For most people, the most common side effect
after the removal of CSF is a headache. This occurs
in 10–30% of adult patients and in up to 40% of
children. It is caused by a decreased CSF pressure
related to a small leak of CSF through the puncture
site. These headaches usually are a dull pain, although
some people report a throbbing sensation. A stiff neck
and nausea may accompany the headache. Lumbar
puncture headaches typically begin within two days
after the procedure and persist from a few days to
several weeks or months.
Since an upright position worsens the pain, patients
with a lumbar puncture headache can control the pain
by lying in a flat position and taking a prescription or
non-prescription pain relief medication, preferably one
containing caffeine. In rare cases, the puncture site leak
is ‘‘patched’’ using the patient’s own blood.
People should talk to their doctor about complications from a lumbar puncture. In most cases, this
test to analyze CSF is a safe and effective procedure.
Some patients experience pain, difficulty urinating,
infection, or leakage of cerebrospinal fluid from the
puncture site after the procedure.

Normal results
Normal CSF is clear and colorless. It may be
cloudy in infections; straw- or yellow-colored if there

area of the spinal column used to obtain the sample is
in the lumbar spine, or lower section of the back. In
rare instances, such as a spinal fluid blockage in the
middle of the back, a doctor may perform a spinal tap
in the neck. The lower lumbar spine (usually between
the vertebrae known as L4–5) is preferable because the
spinal cord stops near L2, and a needle introduced
below this level will miss the spinal cord and encounter
only nerve roots, which are easily pushed aside.

I Cerumen impaction
Definition
Cerumen impaction is a condition in which earwax has become tightly packed in the external ear
canal to the point that the canal is blocked.

Description
Cerumen impaction develops when earwax accumulates in the inner part of the ear canal and blocks
the eardrum. It affects between 2%–6% of the general
population in the United States. Impaction does not
happen under normal circumstances because cerumen
is produced by glands in the outer part of the ear canal;
it is not produced in the inner part. The cerumen traps
sand or dust particles before they reach the ear drum.
It also protects the outer part of the ear canal because
it repels water. The slow movement of the outer layer
of skin of the ear canal carries cerumen toward the
outer opening of the ear. As the older cerumen reaches
the opening of the ear, it dries out and falls away.

Causes and symptoms
Causes
Cerumen is most likely to become impacted when
it is pushed against the eardrum by cotton-tipped
applicators, hair pins, or other objects that people
put in their ears; and when it is trapped against the
eardrum by a hearing aid. Less common causes of
cerumen impaction include overproduction of earwax
by the glands in the ear canal, or an abnormally
shaped ear canal.
Symptoms
The most important symptom of cerumen impaction is partial loss of hearing. Other symptoms are

itching, tinnitus (noise or ringing in the ears), a sensation of fullness in the ear, and pain.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of impacted cerumen is usually
made by examining the ear canal and eardrum with
an otoscope, an instrument with a light attached that
allows the doctor to look into the canal.

throat (ENT) specialist. The specialist can remove the
wax with a vacuum device or a curette, which is a small
scoop-shaped surgical instrument.
Some doctors prescribe special ear drops, such as
Cerumenex, to soften the wax. The most common side
effect of Cerumenex is an allergic skin reaction. Overthe-counter wax removal products include Debrox or
Murine Ear Drops. A 3% solution of hydrogen peroxide may also be used. These products are less likely
to irritate the skin of the ear.

Treatment
Irrigation is the most common method of removing impacted cerumen. It involves washing out the ear
canal with water from a commercial irrigator or a
syringe with a catheter attached. Although some doctors use Water Piks to remove cerumen, most do not
recommend them because the stream of water is too
forceful and may damage the eardrum. The doctor
may add a small amount of alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other antiseptic. The water must be close to
body temperature; if it is too cold or too warm, the
patient may feel dizzy or nauseated. After the ear has
been irrigated, the doctor will apply antibiotic ear
drops to protect the ear from infection.
Irrigation should not be used to remove cerumen
if the patient’s eardrum is ruptured or missing; if the
patient has a history of chronic otitis media (inflammation of the middle ear) or a myringotomy (cutting
the eardrum to allow fluid to escape from the middle
ear); or if the patient has hearing in only one ear.
If irrigation cannot be used or fails to remove the
cerumen, the patient is referred to an ear, nose, and

Alternative treatment
One alternative method that is sometimes touted
as a way to remove impacted cerumen is ear candling.
Ear candling involves the insertion of a burning candle
or a cone of wax-soaked linen or cotton into the
affected ear. The person lies on his or her side with
the affected ear uppermost. A collecting plate is placed
on the ear to catch melted wax. The cone or candle is
threaded through a hole in the plate into the ear canal
and lit. A variation on this technique involves blowing
herbal smoke into the ear through homemade pottery
cones. Practitioners of ear candling claim that the heat
from the burning candle or smoke creates a vacuum
that draws out the impacted cerumen. Some also claim
that ear candling improves hearing, relieves sinus infections, cures earache or swimmer’s ear, stops tinnitus, or
purifies the mind. None of these claims are true. Ear
candling is not recognized as an acceptable alternative
practice by naturopaths, homeopaths, practitioners of
Native American medicine, or any other authority on
complementary and alternative medicine.

Cerumen—The medical term for earwax.
Curette—A small scoop-shaped surgical instrument that can be used to remove cerumen if irrigation does not work or cannot be used.
Ear candling—An alternative method for removing

Irrigation—The technique of removing cerumen
from the ear canal by flushing it with water.
Myringotomy—Surgical cutting of the ear drum to
allow fluid to escape from the middle ear.
Otitis media—Inflammation of the middle ear.
Patients who have had recurrent otitis media
should not have cerumen removed by irrigation.
Tinnitus—A sensation of noise or ringing in the
ears. Tinnitus may be a symptom of cerumen
impaction.

Ear candling is not only an ineffective way to
remove impacted cerumen, it can actually damage
the ear. According to a 1996 survey of 122 otolaryngologists (doctors who specialize in treating ear, nose,
and throat disorders) in the Spokane area, the doctors
reported 21 severe ear injuries resulting from ear candling, including 13 cases of external burns, 7 cases of ear
canal obstruction from melted candle wax, and 1 case
of eardrum perforation. Ear candles cannot legally be
sold as health devices in the United States because they
do not have Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approval. A similar ban is in effect in Canada. Ear
candles are, however, available over the Internet and
in some health food stores with the labeling ‘‘for
entertainment only.’’

Prognosis
In most cases, impacted cerumen is successfully
removed by irrigation with no lasting side effects.
Irrigation can, however, lead to infection of the outer
or the middle ear if the patient has a damaged or
absent ear drum. Patients who try to remove earwax
themselves with hair pins or similar objects run the risk
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Prevention
The best method of cleaning the external ear is to
wipe the outer opening with a damp washcloth folded
over the index finger, without going into the ear canal
itself. Two techniques have been recommended to
prevent cerumen from reaccumulating in the ear. The
patient may place two or three drops of mineral oil
into each ear once a week, allow it to remain for two or
three minutes, and rinse it out with warm water; or
place two drops of Domeboro otic solution in each ear
once a week after showering.
Patients who wear hearing aids should have their
ears examined periodically for signs of cerumen
accumulation.

I Cervical cancer
Definition
Cervical cancer is a disease in which the cells of the
cervix become abnormal and start to grow uncontrollably, forming tumors.

Description
In the United States, cervical cancer is the fifth
most common cancer among women aged 35–54, and
the third most common cancer of the female reproductive tract. In some developing countries, it is the
most common type of cancer. It generally begins as an
abnormality in the cells on the outside of the cervix.
The cervix is the lower part or neck of the uterus
(womb). It connects the body of the uterus to the
vagina (birth canal).
Approximately 90% of cervical cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. This type of cancer originates in
the thin, flat, squamous cells on the surface of the
ectocervix, the part of the cervix that is next to the
vagina. (Squamous cells are the thin, flat cells of
the surfaces of the skin and cervix and linings of
various organs.) Another 10% of cervical cancers are
of the adenocarcinoma type. This cancer originates in
the mucus-producing cells of the inner or endocervix,
near the body of the uterus. Occasionally, the cancer
may have characteristics of both types and is called
adenosquamous carcinoma or mixed carcinoma.
The initial changes that may occur in some cervical
cells are not cancerous. However, these precancerous
cells form a lesion called dysplasia or a squamous
intraepithelial lesion (SIL), since it occurs within the
epithelial or outer layer of cells. These abnormal cells
can also be described as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Moderate to severe dysplasia may be called
carcinoma in situ or non-invasive cervical cancer.
Dysplasia is a common condition and the abnormal cells often disappear without treatment. However,
these precancerous cells can become cancerous. This
may take years, although it can happen in less than a
790

year. Eventually, the abnormal cells start to grow
uncontrollably into the deeper layers of the cervix,
becoming an invasive cervical cancer.
Although cervical cancer used to be one of the
most common causes of cancer death among
American women, in the past 40 years there has been
a 75% decrease in mortality. This is primarily due to
routine screening with Pap tests (Pap smear), to identify precancerous and early-invasive stages of cervical
cancer. With treatment, these conditions have a cure
rate of nearly 100%.
Worldwide, there are more than 400,000 new
cases of cervical cancer diagnosed each year. The
American Cancer Society (ACS) estimated 13,000
new cases of invasive cervical cancer diagnosed in the
United States in 2002. More than one million women
were diagnosed with a precancerous lesion or noninvasive cancer of the cervix in 2001.
Older women are at the highest risk for cervical
cancer. Although girls under the age of 15 rarely
develop this cancer, the risk factor begins to increase
in the late teens. Rates for carcinoma in situ peak
between the ages of 20 and 30. In the United States,
the incidence of invasive cervical cancer increases
rapidly with age for African-American women over
the age of 25. The incidence rises more slowly for
Caucasian women. However, women over age 65
account for more than 25% of all cases of invasive
cervical cancer.
The incidence of cervical cancer is highest among
poor women and among women in developing
countries. In the United States, the death rates from
cervical cancer are higher among Hispanic, Native
American, and African-American women than
among Caucasian women. These groups of women
are much less likely to receive regular Pap tests.
Therefore, their cervical cancers usually are diagnosed
at a much later stage, after the cancer has spread to
other parts of the body.

Causes and symptoms
Human papillomavirus
Infection with the common human papillomavirus
(HPV) is a cause of approximately 90% of all cervical
cancers. There are more than 80 types of HPV. About
30 of these types can be transmitted sexually, including
those that cause genital warts (papillomas). About half
of the sexually transmitted HPVs are associated with
cervical cancer. These ‘‘high-risk’’ HPVs produce a
protein that can cause cervical epithelial cells to grow
uncontrollably. The virus makes a second protein that
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

More than six million women in the United States
have persistent HPV infections, for which there are no
cure. Nevertheless, most women with HPV do not
develop cervical cancer.
Symptoms of invasive cervical cancer
Most women do not have symptoms of cervical
cancer until it has become invasive. At that point, the
symptoms may include:


unusual vaginal discharge



light vaginal bleeding or spots of blood outside of
normal menstruation



pain or vaginal bleeding with sexual intercourse



post-menopausal vaginal bleeding

Once the cancer has invaded the tissue surrounding the cervix, a woman may experience pain in the
pelvic region and heavy bleeding from the vagina.

Diagnosis
The Pap test
Most often, cervical cancer is first detected with a
Pap test that is performed as part of a regular pelvic
examination. The vagina is spread with a metal
or plastic instrument called a speculum. A swab is used
to remove mucus and cells from the cervix. This sample
is sent to a laboratory for microscopic examination.
The Pap test is a screening tool rather than a
diagnostic tool. It is very efficient at detecting cervical
abnormalities. The Bethesda System commonly is
used to report Pap test results. A negative test means
that no abnormalities are present in the cervical tissue.
A positive Pap test describes abnormal cervical cells as
low-grade or high-grade SIL, depending on the extent
of dysplasia. About 5–10% of Pap tests show at least
mild abnormalities. However, a number of factors
other than cervical cancer can cause abnormalities,
including inflammation from bacteria or yeast infections. A few months after the infection is treated, the
Pap test is repeated.
Biopsy
Following an abnormal Pap test, a colposcopy is
usually performed. The physician uses a magnifying
scope to view the surface of the cervix. The cervix may
be coated with an iodine solution that causes normal
cells to turn brown and abnormal cells to turn white or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

yellow. This is called a Schiller test. If any abnormal
areas are observed, a colposcopic biopsy may be performed. A biopsy is the removal of a small piece of
tissue for microscopic examination by a pathologist.
Other types of cervical biopsies may be performed.
An endocervical curettage is a biopsy in which a narrow
instrument called a curette is used to scrape tissue from
inside the opening of the cervix. A cone biopsy, or
conization, is used to remove a cone-shaped piece of
tissue from the cervix. In a cold knife cone biopsy, a
surgical scalpel or laser is used to remove the tissue.
A loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is a
cone biopsy using a wire that is heated by an electrical
current. Cone biopsies can be used to determine
whether abnormal cells have invaded below the surface
of the cervix. They also can be used to treat many
precancers and very early cancers. Biopsies may be
performed with a local or general anesthetic. They
may cause cramping and bleeding.
Diagnosing the stage
Following a diagnosis of cervical cancer, various
procedures may be used to stage the disease (determine
how far the cancer has spread). For example, additional pelvic exams may be performed under
anesthesia.
There are several procedures for determining if
cervical cancer has invaded the urinary tract. With
cystoscopy, a lighted tube with a lens is inserted
through the urethra (the urine tube from the bladder
to the exterior) and into the bladder to examine these
organs for cancerous cells. Tissue samples may be
removed for microscopic examination by a pathologist. Intravenous urography (intravenous pyelogram or
IVP) is an x ray of the urinary system, following the
injection of special dye. The kidneys remove the dye
from the bloodstream and the dye passes into the
ureters (the tubes from the kidneys to the bladder)
and bladder. IVP can detect a blocked ureter, caused
by the spread of cancer to the pelvic lymph nodes
(small glands that are part of the immune system).
A procedure called proctoscopy or sigmoidoscopy
is similar to cystoscopy. It is used to determine
whether the cancer has spread to the rectum or lower
large intestine.
Computed tomography (CT) scans, ultrasound, or
other imaging techniques may be used to determine
the spread of cancer to various parts of the body. With
a CT scan, an x-ray beam rotates around the body,
taking images from various angles. It is used to determine if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses a

thought to be a cause of about 50% of cervical cancers.

Cervical cancer

magnetic field to image the body, sometimes is used
for evaluating the spread of cervical cancer. Chest
x rays may be used to detect cervical cancer that has
spread to the lungs.

Treatment
Following a diagnosis of cervical cancer, the physician takes a medical history and performs a complete
physical examination. This includes an evaluation of
symptoms and risk factors for cervical cancer. The
lymph nodes are examined for evidence that the cancer
has spread from the cervix. The choice of treatment
depends on the clinical stage of the disease.



Stage IV: Cancer has spread to other parts of the
body



Stage IVA: Cancer has spread to the bladder or
rectum



Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to distant organs such
as the lungs



Recurrent: Following treatment, cancer has returned
to the cervix or some other part of the body

In addition to the stage of the cancer, factors such
as a woman’s age, general health, and preferences may
influence the choice of treatment. The exact location
of the cancer within the cervix and the type of cervical
cancer also are important considerations.

The FIGO system of staging
The International Federation of Gynecologists
and Obstetricians (FIGO) system usually is used to
stage cervical cancer:


Stage 0: Carcinoma in situ; non-invasive cancer that
is confined to the layer of cells lining the cervix



Stage I: Cancer that has spread into the connective
tissue of the cervix but is confined to the uterus

Treatment of precancer and carcinoma in situ
Most low-grade SILs that are detected with Pap
tests revert to normal without treatment. Most highgrade SILs require treatment. Treatments to remove
precancerous cells include:


cold knife cone biopsy



LEEP

Stage IA: Very small cancerous area that is visible
only with a microscope



cryosurgery (freezing the cells with a metal probe)



cauterization or diathermy (burning off the cells)



Stage IA1: Invasion area is less than 3 mm (0.13 in)
deep and 7 mm (0.33 in) wide



laser surgery (burning off the cells with a laser beam)



Stage IA2: Invasion area is 3–5 mm (0.13–0.2 in)
deep and less than 7 mm (0.33 in) wide



Stage IB: Cancer can be seen without a microscope
or is deeper than 5 mm (0.2 in) or wider than 7 mm
(0.33 in)



Stage IB1: Cancer is no larger than 4 cm (1.6 in)



Stage IB2: Stage IB cancer is larger than 4 cm (1.6 in)



Stage II: Cancer has spread from the cervix but is
confined to the pelvic region



Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to the upper region of
the vagina, but not to the lower one-third of the
vagina



Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to the parametrial tissue adjacent to the cervix



Stage III: Cancer has spread to the lower one-third of
the vagina or to the wall of the pelvis and may be
blocking the ureters



Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the lower vagina
but not to the pelvic wall



Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the pelvic wall and/
or is blocking the flow of urine through the ureters to
the bladder



These methods also may be used to treat cancer
that is confined to the surface of the cervix (stage 0)
and other early-stage cervical cancers in women who
may want to become pregnant. They may be used in
conjunction with other treatments. These procedures
may cause bleeding or cramping. All of these treatments require close follow-up to detect any recurrence
of the cancer.
Surgery
A simple hysterectomy is used to treat some stages
0 and IA cervical cancers. Usually only the uterus is
removed, although occasionally the fallopian tubes
and ovaries are removed as well. The tissues adjoining
the uterus, including the vagina, remain intact. The
uterus may be removed either through the abdomen or
the vagina.
In a radical hysterectomy, the uterus and adjoining tissues, including the ovaries, the upper region
(1 in) of the vagina near the cervix, and the pelvic
lymph nodes, are all removed. A radical hysterectomy usually involves abdominal surgery. However, it
can be performed vaginally, in combination with
a laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection. With
laparoscopy, a tube is inserted through a very small
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

recurrent cervical cancers usually are treated with a
combination of external and internal radiation and chemotherapy. The common drugs used for cervical cancer
are cisplatin, ifosfamide, and fluorouracil. These may
be injected or taken by mouth. The National Cancer
Institute recommends that chemotherapy with cisplatin
be considered for all women receiving radiation therapy
for cervical cancer.

If cervical cancer recurs following treatment, a
pelvic exenteration (extensive surgery) may be performed. This includes a radical hysterectomy, with the
additional removal of the bladder, rectum, part of the
colon, and/or all of the vagina. Such operations require
the creation of new openings for the urine and feces.
A new vagina may be created surgically. Often the
clitoris and other outer genitals are left intact.

The side effects of chemotherapy depend on a
number of factors, including the type of drug, the
dosage, and the length of the treatment. Side effects
may include:

Recovery from a pelvic exenteration may take six
months to two years. This treatment is successful with
40–50% of recurrent cervical cancers that are confined
to the pelvis. If the recurrent cancer has spread to
other organs, radiation or chemotherapy may be used
to alleviate some of the symptoms.
Radiation
Radiation therapy, which involves the use of highdosage x rays or other high-energy waves to kill cancer
cells, often is used for treating stages IB, IIA, and IIB
cervical cancers, or in combination with surgery. With
external-beam radiation therapy, the rays are focused
on the pelvic area from a source outside the body. With
implant or internal radiation therapy, a pellet of radioactive material is placed internally, near the tumor.
Alternatively, thin needles may be used to insert the
radioactive material directly into the tumor.
Radiation therapy to the pelvic region can have
many side effects:


skin reaction in the area of treatment



fatigue



upset stomach and loose bowels



vaginal stenosis (narrowing of the vagina due to
build-up of scar tissue) leading to painful sexual
intercourse



premature menopause in young women



problems with urination
Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy, the use of one or more drugs to kill
cancer cells, is used to treat disease that has spread
beyond the cervix. Most often it is used following surgery or radiation treatment. Stages IIB, III, IV, and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



nausea and vomiting



fatigue



changes in appetite



hair loss



mouth or vaginal sores



infections



menstrual cycle changes



premature menopause



infertility



bleeding or anemia (low red blood cell count)

With the exception of menopause and infertility,
most of the side effects are temporary.

Alternative treatment
Biological therapy sometimes is used to treat cervical cancer, either alone or in combination with
chemotherapy. Treatment with the immune-system
protein interferon is used to boost the immune
response. Biological therapy can cause temporary
flu-like symptoms and other side effects.
Some research suggests that vitamin A (carotene)
may help to prevent or stop cancerous changes in cells
such as those on the surface of the cervix. Other studies
suggest that vitamins C and E may reduce the risk of
cervical cancer.

Prognosis
For cervical cancers that are diagnosed in the preinvasive stage, the five-year-survival rate is almost
100%. When cervical cancer is detected in the early
invasive stages, approximately 91% of women survive
five years or more. Stage IVB cervical cancer is not
considered to be curable. The five-year-survival rate
for all cervical cancers combined is about 70%. The
death rate from cervical cancer continues to decline by
about 2% each year. Women over age 65 account for
793

surgical incision for the removal of the lymph nodes.
These operations are used to treat stages IA2, IB, and
IIA cervical cancers, particularly in young women.
Following a hysterectomy, the tissue is examined to
see if the cancer has spread and requires additional
radiation treatment. Women who have had hysterectomies cannot become pregnant, but complications
from a hysterectomy are rare.

Cervical cancer

40–50% of all deaths from cervical cancer. About 4,100
women died of the disease in the United States in 2002.

Prevention
Viral infections
Most cervical cancers are preventable. More than
90% of women with cervical cancer are infected with
HPV. HPV infection is the single most important risk
factor. This is particularly true for young women
because the cells lining the cervix do not fully mature
until age 18. These immature cells are more susceptible
to cancer-causing agents and viruses.
Since HPV is a sexually-transmitted infection,
sexual behaviors can put women at risk for HPV
infection and cervical cancer. These behaviors include:


sexual intercourse at age 16 or younger



partners who began having intercourse at a young age



multiple sexual partners



sexual partners who have had multiple partners
(‘‘high-risk males’’)



a partner who has had a previous sexual partner with
cervical cancer

HPV infection may not produce any symptoms,
so sexual partners may not know that they are
infected. In 2003, a new DNA screening test was
approved by the FDA to test for HPV at the same
time as the Pap test. Condoms do not necessarily prevent HPV infection. However, in 2003, a preliminary
study demonstrated that a vaccine against the type of
HPV that causes the most cervical cancers showed
promise in preventing HPV infection. Scientists predict having FDA approval of an HPV vaccine by
about 2008 or 2010.
Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a risk factor for cervical cancer.
Women who test positive for HIV may have impaired
immune systems that cannot correct precancerous conditions. Furthermore, sexual behavior that puts women
at risk for HIV infection, also puts them at risk for HPV
infection. There is some evidence suggesting that
another sexually transmitted virus, the genital herpes
virus, also may be involved in cervical cancer.

cervical cells. The risk increases with the number of
years a woman smokes and the amount she smokes.
A 2003 study also linked smoking to poorer outcomes
and survivals in cervical cancer patients.
Diet and drugs
Diets that are low in fruits and vegetables increase
the risk of cervical cancer. A 2003 study also linked
obesity to increased risk for cervical adenocarcinoma.
Even women who were overweight had a higher incidence of the disease. The link appears to be increase
levels of estrogen. Excessive fat tissue influences levels
of estrogen and other sex hormones. Women also have
an increased risk of cervical cancer if their mothers
took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) while they were
pregnant. This drug was given to women between 1940
and 1971 to prevent miscarriages. Some statistical
studies have suggested that the long-term use of oral
contraceptives may slightly increase the risk of cervical
cancer.
Pap tests
Most cases of cervical cancers are preventable,
since they start with easily detectable precancerous
changes. Therefore, the best prevention for cervical
cancer is a regular Pap test. The ACS revised its guidelines for regular screening in late 2002. In brief, women
should begin having Pap tests about three years after
having sexual intercourse, but no later than 21 years of
age. Women should continue screening every year
with regular Pap tests until age 30. Once a woman
has had three normal results in a row, she may get
screened every two to three years. A doctor may suggest more frequent screening if a woman has certain
risk factors for cervical cancer. Women who have had
total hysterectomies including the removal of the cervix and those over age 70 who have had three normal
results generally do not need to continue having Pap
tests under the new guidelines.
The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early
Detection Program provides free or low-cost Pap tests
and treatment for women without health insurance,
for older women, and for members of racial and ethnic
minorities. The program is administered through individual states, under the direction of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.

Smoking
Smoking may double the risk of cervical cancer. In
fact, studies suggest that nearly 50% of women diagnosed with cervical cancer smoke. Chemicals produced by tobacco smoke can damage the DNA of

Special concerns
If a woman is diagnosed with very early-stage (IA)
cervical cancer while pregnant, the physician usually
will recommend a hysterectomy after the baby is born.

The patient lies on the table with her legs raised in
stirrups, similar to the position when having a Pap
test. The patient is given general anesthesia, and the
vagina is held open with an instrument called a speculum. Using a scalpel or laser the doctor removes a
cone-shaped piece of the cervix containing the area
with abnormal cells. The resulting crater is repaired
by stitching flaps of tissue over the wound.
Alternatively, the wound may be left open, and heat
or freezing is used to stop bleeding.

present, other tests will be needed. Surgery will be
performed to remove the cervix and uterus (hysterectomy) and other treatments may be used as well. If the
abnormal cells are precancerous, a laser can be used to
destroy them.

I Cervical conization
Definition
Cervical conization is both a diagnostic and treatment tool used to detect and treat abnormalities of the
cervix. It is also known as a cone biopsy or cold knife
cone biopsy.

Purpose
Cervical conization is performed if the results of a
cervical biopsy have found a precancerous condition
in the cervix. The cervix is the small cylindrical organ
at the lower part of the uterus, which separates the
uterus from the vagina. Cervical conization also may
be performed if there is an abnormal cervical smear
test (Pap test). A biopsy is a diagnostic test in which
tissue or cells are removed from the body and examined under a microscope, primarily to look for cancer
or other abnormalities.

Precautions
As with any operation that is performed under
general anesthesia, the patient must not eat or drink
anything for six to eight hours before surgery.
796

Cold knife cone biopsy used to be the preferred
treatment for removing abnormal cells in the cervix.
Now, most cone biopsies are performed using laser
surgery. Cold knife cone biopsy is generally used only
for special situations. For example, if a biopsy did not
remove all the abnormal cells, the cold knife cone procedure allows the physician to remove what’s left.

Aftercare
An overnight stay in the hospital may be required.
After the test, the patient may feel some cramps or
discomfort for about a week. Women should not have
sex, use tampons, or douche until after seeing their
physician for a follow up appointment (a week or
more after the procedure).

Risks
Because cone biopsies carry risks such as bleeding
and problems with subsequent pregnancies, they have
been replaced with newer technologies except in a few
circumstances.
About one in 10 women experience bleeding from
the vagina about two weeks after the biopsy. There is
also a slight risk of infection or perforation of the
uterus. In a few women, the cervical canal becomes
narrowed or completely blocked, which can later
interfere with the movement of sperm. This can impair
a woman’s fertility.
If too much muscle tissue has been removed, the
procedure can lead to an incompetent cervix, which can
be a problem with subsequent pregnancies. An incompetent cervix cannot seal properly to maintain a

I Cervical disk disease
Definition
Cervical disk disease refers to a gradual deterioration of the spongy disks in the top part of the spine.

Cervical disk disease affects everyone to some
degree, often without causing any bothersome symptoms. However, this condition can also lead to specific
problems related to nerve functioning. For example,
the outer edge of a disk may tear, allowing the gelatinous material inside to bulge outward (herniated disk).
This can put pressure on nerves that exit the spine.
Two adjacent vertebrae may rub together (sometimes
resulting in bone spurs) that can also pinch these
nerves. In other cases, the inner part of the ring may
push on the spinal cord itself, which passes through
the disk. Any of these situations can cause pain and
limit movement. While symptoms primarily affect the
neck, they can also occur in other parts of the body.

Causes and symptoms
Cervical disk disease is a gradual process that
occurs with aging, though poor posture, repeated lifting, and tobacco use can hasten its course. Symptoms
include pain when moving the neck and limited neck
movement. The condition can also affect the hand,
shoulder, and arm resulting in pain, numbness/tingling, and weakness. If the spinal cord itself is affected,
these symptoms may occur in the legs. Loss of bowel
or bladder control may also occur.

Diagnosis
Cervical disk disease is typically diagnosed by an
orthopedist or a neurologist. After taking a medical
history and conducting a physical examination, the
doctor will recommend an imaging procedure to
gather more information about the nature of the problem. This may include a CT scan, an MRI, or myelography. In addition, an electromyogram (EMG) may
be used to evaluate the functioning of nerves in the
arms, hands, or legs. Cervical disk disease is typically
covered by medical insurance.

Treatment
Description
The spine is made up of 33 bones called vertebrae
separated by spongy rings of elastic material. These
rings, known as disks, are often compared to shock
absorbers because they help to cushion the vertebrae.
Just as importantly, they also make it possible to turn the
head and neck. Over time, these disks slowly become

Treatment usually involves physical therapy, several
weeks of drug therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and limited use of a cervical collar
(to reduce neck movement). Neck traction and heat
treatments may also be recommended. In some cases,
steroids or anesthetic drugs may be injected into the
spinal canal to help alleviate symptoms. Aside from

these measures, maintaining good posture and placing a
pillow under the neck and head during sleep can be
helpful. Treatment may last anywhere from several
weeks to three months or more. Neck surgery is not
usually advised unless other therapies have failed.

Alternative treatment
Acupuncture, therapeutic massage, and yoga are
believed by some practitioners of alternative medicine
to have generalized pain-relieving effects. However,
any therapy that involves manipulating the neck is
not recommended and be approved by primary doctor
beforehand.

Prognosis
In most people symptoms go away within three
months if not sooner. A smaller number may require
surgery to correct the problem.

Prevention
While some degree of disk degeneration is inevitable, people can reduce their risk by practicing good
posture (during sitting, standing, and lifting), performing neck-stretching exercises, maintaining an
ideal weight, and quitting smoking.

spondylosis

I Cervical spondylosis
Definition
Cervical spondylosis refers to common agerelated changes in the area of the spine at the back of
the neck. With age, the vertebrae (the component
bones of the spine) gradually form bone spurs, and
their shock-absorbing disks slowly shrink. These
changes can alter the alignment and stability of the
spine. They may go unnoticed, or they may produce
problems related to pressure on the spine and associated nerves and blood vessels. This pressure can
cause weakness, numbness, and pain in various areas
of the body. In severe cases, walking and other activities may be compromised.

Description
As it runs from the brain down the back, the
spinal cord is protected by ringlike bones, called vertebrae, stacked one upon the other. The vertebrae are
not in direct contact with one another, however. The
intervening spaces are filled with structures called
disks. The disks are made up of a tough, fibrous
outer tissue with an inner core of elastic or gel-like
tissue.
One of the most important functions of disks is
protecting the vertebrae and the nerves and blood vessels between the vertebrae. The disks also lend flexibility to the spinal cord, facilitating movements such as
turning the head or bending the neck. As people age,
disks gradually become tougher and more unyielding.
Disks also shrink with age, which reduces the amount
of padding between the vertebrae.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

By age 50, 25–50% of people develop cervical
spondylosis; by 75 years of age, it is seen in at least
70% of people. Although shrunken vertebral disks,
osteophyte growth, and other changes in their cervical
spine may exist, many of these people never develop
significant problems.
However, about 50% of people over age 50 experience neck pain and stiffness due to cervical spondylosis.
Of these people, 25–40% have at least one episode of
cervical radiculopathy, a condition that arises when
osteophytes compress nerves between the vertebrae.
Another potential problem occurs if osteophytes,
degenerating disks, or shifting vertebrae narrow the
spinal canal. This pressure compresses the spinal cord
and its blood vessels, causing cervical spondylitic myelopathy, a disorder in which large segments of the spinal
cord are damaged. This disorder affects fewer than 5%
of people with cervical spondylosis. Symptoms of both
cervical spondylitic myelopathy and cervical radiculopathy may be present in some people.

Causes and symptoms
As people age, shrinkage of the vertebral disks
prompts the vertebrae to form osteophytes to stabilize
the back bone. However, the position and alignment
of the disks and vertebrae may shift despite the osteophytes. Symptoms may arise from problems with one
or more disks or vertebrae.
Osteophyte formation and other changes do not
necessarily lead to symptoms, but after age 50, half of
the population experiences occasional neck pain and
stiffness. As disks degenerate, the cervical spine becomes
less stable, and the neck is more vulnerable to injuries,
including muscle and ligament strains. Contact between
the edges of the vertebrae can also cause pain. In some
people, this pain may be referred–that is, perceived as
occurring in the head, shoulders, or chest, rather than
the neck. Other symptoms may include vertigo (a type
of dizziness) or ringing in the ears.
The neck pain and stiffness can be intermittent, as
can symptoms of radiculopathy. Radiculopathy refers
to compression on the base, or root, of nerves that lead
away from the spinal cord. Normally, these nerves fit
comfortably through spaces between the vertebrae.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

These spaces are called intervertebral foramina. As the
osteophytes form, they can impinge on this area and
gradually make the fit between the vertebrae too snug.
The poor fit increases the chances that a minor
incident, such as overdoing normal activities, may
place excess pressure on the nerve root, sometimes
referred to as a pinched nerve. Pressure may also
accumulate as a direct consequence of osteophyte formation. The pressure on the nerve root causes severe
shooting pain in the neck, arms, shoulder, and/or
upper back, depending on which nerve roots of the
cervical spine are affected. The pain is often aggravated by movement, but in most cases, symptoms
resolve within four to six weeks.
Cervical spondylosis can cause cervical spondylitic myelopathy through stenosis- or osteophyterelated pressure on the spinal cord. Spinal stenosis is
a narrowing of the spinal canal– the area through the
center of the vertebral column occupied by the spinal
cord. Stenosis occurs because of misaligned vertebrae
and out-of-place or degenerating disks. The problems
created by spondylosis can be exacerbated if a person
has a naturally narrow spinal canal. Pressure against
the spinal cord can also be created by osteophytes
forming on the inner surface of vertebrae and pushing
against the spinal cord. Stenosis or osteophytes can
compress the spinal cord and its blood vessels, impeding or choking off needed nutrients to the spinal cord
cells; in effect, the cells starve to death.
With the death of these cells, the functions that
they once performed are impaired. These functions
may include conveying sensory information to the
brain or transmitting the brain’s commands to voluntary muscles. Pain is usually absent, but a person may
experience leg numbness and an inability to make the
legs move properly. Other symptoms can include
clumsiness and weakness in the hands, stiffness and
weakness in the legs, and spontaneous twitches in the
legs. A person’s ability to walk is affected, and a widelegged, shuffling gait is sometimes adopted to compensate for the lack of sensation in the legs and the
accompanying, realistic fear of falling. In very few
cases, bladder control becomes a problem.

Diagnosis
Cervical spondylosis is often suspected based on
the symptoms and their history. Careful neurological
examination can help determine which nerve roots are
involved, based on the location of the pain and numbness, and the pattern of weakness and changes in reflex
responses. To confirm the suspected diagnosis, and to
rule out other possibilities, imaging tests are ordered.
799

Cervical spondylosis

As the amount of padding shrinks, the spine loses
stability. The vertebrae react by constructing osteophytes, commonly known as bone spurs. There are
seven vertebrae in the neck; development of osteophytes
on these bones is sometimes called cervical osteoarthritis. Osteophytes may help to stabilize the degenerating
backbone and help protect the spinal cord.

Cervical spondylosis

The first test is an x ray. X rays reveal the presence of
osteophytes, stenosis, constricted space between the
vertebrae, and misalignment in the cervical spine–in
short, an x ray confirms that a person has cervical
spondylosis. To demonstrate that the condition is
causing the symptoms, more details are needed.
Other imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography myelography,
help assess effects of cervical spondylosis on associated nerve tissue and blood vessels.
An MRI may be preferred, because it is a noninvasive procedure and does not require injecting a
contrast medium as does computed tomography myelography. MRIs also have greater sensitivity for detecting disk problems and spinal cord involvement, and the
test allows the physician to create images of a larger
area from various angles. However, these images may
not show enough detail about the vertebrae themselves.
Computed tomography myelography yields a superior
image of the bones involved in cervical spondylosis.
Added benefits include that it takes less time to perform
and tends to be less expensive than an MRI. A good
diagnosis may be reached with either a computed tomography myelography or an MRI, but sometimes complementary information from both tests is necessary.
Nerve conduction velocity, electromyogram (EMG),
and/or somatosensory evoked potential testing may
help to confirm which nerve roots are involved.

Treatment
When possible, conservative treatment of symptoms is preferred. Conservative treatment begins with
rest–either restricting normal activities to a less strenuous level or bed rest for three to five days. If rest is not
adequate to relieve symptoms, a cervical orthosis may
be prescribed, such as a soft cervical collar or stiffer
neck brace to restrict neck movement and shift some of
the head’s weight from the neck to the shoulders.
Cervical traction may also be suggested, either at
home with the advice of a physical therapist or in a
health-care setting.
Pain is treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. If these drugs are
ineffective, a short-term prescription for corticosteroids
or muscle relaxants may be given. For chronic pain,
tricyclic antidepressants can be prescribed. Although
these drugs were developed to treat depression, they
are also effective in treating pain. Once any pain is
resolved, exercises to strengthen neck muscle and preserve flexibility are prescribed.
If the pain is severe, a short treatment of epidural
corticosteroids may be prescribed with discretion.
800

A corticosteroid such as prednisone can be combined
with an anaesthetic and injected with a long needle
into the space between the damaged disk and the
covering of the nerve and spinal cord. Injection into
the cervical epidural space relieves severe pain that is
not managed with conventional treatment. Frequent
use of this treatment is not medically recommended
and is used only if the more conservative therapy is not
effective.
If pain is continuous and does not respond to
conservative treatment, surgery may be suggested.
Surgery is usually not recommended for neck pain,
but it may be necessary to address radiculopathy and
myelopathy. Surgery is particularly recommended for
people who have already developed moderate to
severe symptoms of myelopathy, although age or
poor health may prohibit that recommendation. The
specific details of the surgery depend on the structures
involved, but the overall goal is to relieve pressure on
the nerve root, spinal cord, or blood vessels and to
stabilize the spine.

Alternative treatment
Alternative therapy is not meant to replace conventional medical treatment, but it can be a useful adjunct.
Its main roles are to relieve tension, manage pain, and
strengthen neck and back muscles. Massage is one way
to relieve tension, and yoga provides the additional
benefit of strengthening muscles. Chiropractic and acupuncture have been reported to relieve the pain associated with disk problems, although great care needs to
be taken to avoid exacerbating them. Practitioners of
the Alexander technique or the Feldenkrais method can
provide instruction on correct posture and exercise that
may help prevent further symptoms. Vitamin and
mineral supplementation along with herbal therapies
and homeopathy can help build and rebalance the weakened structure.

Prognosis
The gradual progression of cervical spondylosis
cannot be stopped; however, it doesn’t always cause
symptoms. For the individuals who do experience problems, conservative treatment is very effective in managing the symptoms. Nearly all people with neck pain,
approximately 75% of persons with radiculopathy, and
up to 50% of people with myelopathy find relief
through therapy alone. For the remaining people with
radiculopathy or myelopathy, surgery may be recommended. Surgery is deemed successful in 70–80% of
cases.

cervicitis is sometimes related to a lack of estrogen.
Although a woman may not notice any signs
of infection, symptoms of cervicitis include the
following:


persistent unusual vaginal discharge



abnormal bleeding, either between periods or following sexual intercourse



painful sexual intercourse



vaginal pain



frequent need to urinate



burning or itching in the vaginal area

Diagnosis
The standard method of diagnosing cervicitis is
through a pelvic examination or a Pap smear. During
the pelvic exam, the physician usually swabs the
affected area, and then sends the tissue sample to a
laboratory. The laboratory tries to identify the specific
organism responsible for causing the cervicitis.
A biopsy to take a sample of tissue from the affected
area is sometimes required in order to rule out cancer.
Colposcopy, a procedure used to look at the cervix
under a microscope, may also be used to rule out
cancer.

Treatment
The first course of treatment for cervicitis is
usually antibiotics. If these medicines do not cure the
cervicitis, other treatment options include:

Purpose
Cesarean sections, also called c-sections, are performed whenever abnormal conditions complicate
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Difficult labor is commonly caused by one of the
three following conditions: abnormalities in the
mother’s birth canal; abnormalities in the position of
the fetus; or abnormalities in the labor, including weak
or infrequent contractions.
Another major factor is fetal distress, a condition
where the fetus is not getting enough oxygen. Fetal
brain damage can result from oxygen deprivation.
Fetal distress is often related to abnormalities in the
position of the fetus or abnormalities in the birth
canal, causing reduced blood flow through the placenta. Other conditions also can make c-section advisable, such as vaginal herpes, hypertension, and
diabetes in the mother.

Precautions
There are several ways that obstetricians and
other doctors diagnose conditions that may make a
c-section necessary. Ultrasound testing reveals the
positions of the baby and the placenta and may be
used to estimate the baby’s size and gestational age.
Fetal heart monitors, in use since the 1970s, transmit
any signals of fetal distress. Oxygen deprivation may
be determined by checking the amniotic fluid for
meconium (feces)—a lack of oxygen causes an unborn
baby to defecate. Oxygen deprivation may also be
determined by testing the pH of a blood sample
taken from the baby’s scalp; a pH of 7.25 or higher is
normal, between 7.2 and 7.25 is suspicious, and below
7.2 is a sign of trouble.
When a c-section is being considered because
labor is not progressing, the mother should first be
encouraged to walk around to stimulate labor. Labor
may also be stimulated with the drug oxytocin.
When a c-section is being considered because
the baby is in a breech position, the doctor may
first attempt to reposition the baby; this is called
external cephalic version. The doctor may also try
a vaginal breech delivery, depending on the size of
the mother’s pelvis, the size of the baby, and the
type of breech position the baby is in. However, a
c-section is safer than a vaginal delivery when the
baby is 8 lbs (3.6 kg) or larger, in a breech position
with the feet crossed, or in a breech position with the
head hyperextended.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

A woman should receive regular prenatal care and
be able to alert her doctor to the first signs of trouble.
Once labor begins, she should be encouraged to move
around and to urinate. The doctor should be conservative in diagnosing dystocia (nonprogressive labor)
and fetal distress, taking a position of ‘‘watchful waiting’’ before deciding to operate.

Description
The most common reason that a cesarean section
is performed (in 35% of all cases, according to the
United States Public Health Service) is that the
woman has had a previous c-section. The ‘‘once a
cesarean, always a cesarean’’ rule originated when
the classical uterine incision was made vertically; the
resulting scar was weak and had a risk of rupturing in
subsequent deliveries. Today, the incision is almost
always made horizontally across the lower end of the
uterus (this is called a ‘‘low transverse incision’’),
resulting in reduced blood loss and a decreased
chance of rupture. This kind of incision allows
many women to have a vaginal birth after a cesarean
(VBAC).
The second most common reason that a c-section
is performed (in 30% of all cases) is difficult childbirth due to nonprogressive labor (dystocia). Uterine
contractions may be weak or irregular, the cervix
may not be dilating, or the mother’s pelvic structure
may not allow adequate passage for birth. When the
baby’s head is too large to fit through the pelvis,
the condition is called cephalopelvic disproportion
(CPD).
Another 12% of c-sections are performed to deliver a baby in a breech presentation: buttocks or feet
first. Breech presentation is found in about 3% of all
births.
In 9% of all cases, c-sections are performed in
response to fetal distress. Fetal distress refers to any
situation that threatens the baby, such as the umbilical
cord getting wrapped around the baby’s neck. This
may appear on the fetal heart monitor as an abnormal
heart rate or rhythm.
The remaining 14% of c-sections are indicated by
other serious factors. One is prolapse of the umbilical
cord: the cord is pushed into the vagina ahead of the
baby and becomes compressed, cutting off blood flow
to the baby. Another is placental abruption: the placenta separates from the uterine wall before the baby is
born, cutting off blood flow to the baby. The risk of
this is especially high in multiple births (twins, triplets,
or more). A third factor is placenta previa: the placenta

labor and vaginal delivery, threatening the life or health
of the mother or the baby. In 2003, about 27% of U.S.
deliveries were cesarean, up 6% from 2002. The procedure is often used in cases where the mother has had a
previous c-section. Dystocia, or difficult labor, is the
other common cause of c-sections.

covers the cervix partially or completely, making
vaginal delivery impossible. In some cases requiring
c-section, the baby is in a transverse position, lying
horizontally across the pelvis, perhaps with a
shoulder in the birth canal.
The mother’s health may make delivery by c-section the safer choice, especially in cases of maternal
diabetes, hypertension, genital herpes, Rh blood
incompatibility, and preeclampsia (high blood pressure related to pregnancy).

Preparation
When a c-section becomes necessary, the mother
is prepped for surgery. A catheter is inserted into her
bladder and an intravenous (IV) line is inserted into
her arm. Leads for monitoring the mother’s heart rate,
rhythm, and blood pressure are attached. In the operating room, the mother is given anesthesia—usually a
regional anesthetic (epidural or spinal), making her
numb from below her breasts to her toes. In some
cases, a general anesthetic will be administered.
Surgical drapes are placed over the body, except the
804

head; these drapes block the direct view of the
procedure.
The abdomen is washed with an anti-bacterial
solution and a portion of the pubic hair may be
shaved. The first incision opens the abdomen.
Infrequently, it will be vertical from just below the
navel to the top of the pubic bone, or more commonly,
it will be a horizontal incision across and above the
pubic bone (informally called a ‘‘bikini cut’’).
The second incision opens the uterus. In most
cases a transverse incision is made. This is the favored
type because it heals well and makes it possible for a
woman to attempt a vaginal delivery in the future. The
classical incision is vertical. Because it provides a larger opening than a low transverse incision, it is used in
the most critical situations, such as placenta previa.
However, the classical incision causes more bleeding, a
greater risk of abdominal infection, and a weaker scar,
so the low transverse incision is preferred.
Once the uterus is opened, the amniotic sac is
ruptured and the baby is delivered. The time from
the initial incision to birth is typically five minutes.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Aftercare
A woman who undergoes a c-section requires both
the care given to any new mother and the care given to
any patient recovering from major surgery. She should
be offered pain medication that does not interfere with
breastfeeding. She should be encouraged to get out of
bed and walk around eight to 24 hours after surgery to
stimulate circulation (thus avoiding the formation of
blood clots) and bowel movement. She should limit
climbing stairs to once a day, and avoid lifting anything
heavier than the baby. She should nap as often as the
baby sleeps, and arrange for help with the housework,
meals, and care of other children. She may resume driving after two weeks, although some doctors recommend
waiting for six weeks, the typical recovery period from
major surgery.

Risks
Because a c-section is a surgical procedure, it carries more risk to both the mother and the baby. The
maternal death rate is less than 0.02%, but that is four
times the maternal death rate associated with vaginal
delivery. However, many women have a c-section for
serious medical problems. The mother is at risk for
increased bleeding (because a c-section may result in
twice the blood loss of a vaginal delivery) from the two
incisions, the placental attachment site, and possible
damage to a uterine artery. Complications occur in
less than 10% of cases. The mother may develop infection of either incision, the urinary tract, or the tissue
lining the uterus (endometritis). Less commonly, she
may receive injury to the surrounding organs, like the
bladder and bowel. When a general anesthesia is used,
she may experience complications from the anesthesia.
A 2004 report said that spinal anesthesia and obesity
impair a mother’s respiratory function during cesarean section procedures. Obese women were particularly susceptible to breathing problems. Very rarely, a
woman may develop a wound hematoma at the site of
either incision or other blood clots leading to pelvic
thrombophlebitis (inflammation of the major vein running from the pelvis into the leg) or a pulmonary
embolus (a blood clot lodging in the lung).
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS
Breech presentation—The condition in which the
baby enters the birth canal with its buttocks or feet
first.
Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD)—The condition in which the baby’s head is too large to fit
through the mother’s pelvis.
Classical incision—In a cesarean section, an incision made vertically along the uterus; this kind of
incision makes a larger opening but also creates
more bleeding, a greater chance of infection, and
a weaker scar.
Dystocia—Failure to progress in labor, either
because the cervix will not dilate (expand) further
or (after full dilation) the head does not descend
through the mother’s pelvis.
Low transverse incision—Incision madehorizontally
across the lower end of the uterus; this kind of incision
is preferred for less bleeding and stronger healing.
Placenta previa—The placenta totally or partially
covers the cervix, preventing vaginal delivery.
Placental abruption—Separation of the placenta
from the uterine wall before the baby is born, cutting off blood flow to the baby.
Prolapsed cord—The umbilical cord is pushed into
the vagina ahead of the baby and becomes compressed, cutting off blood flow to the baby.
Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)—Difficulty
breathing, found in infants with immature lungs.
Transverse presentation—The baby is laying sideways across the cervix instead of head first.
VBAC—Vaginal birth after cesarean.

Normal results
The after-effects of a c-section vary, depending on
the woman’s age, physical fitness, and overall health.
Following this procedure, a woman commonly experiences gas pains, incision pain, and uterine contractions—which are also common in vaginal delivery.
Her hospital stay may be two to four days. Breastfeeding the baby is encouraged, taking care that it is in
a position that keeps the baby from resting on the
mother’s incision. As the woman heals, she may gradually increase appropriate exercises to regain abdominal
tone. Full recovery may be seen in four to six weeks.
The prognosis for a successful vaginal birth after a
cesarean (VBAC) may be at least 75%, especially
805

Cesarean section

Once the umbilical cord is clamped and cut, the
newborn is evaluated. The placenta is removed from
the mother, and her uterus and abdomen are stitched
closed (surgical staples may be used instead in closing
the outermost layer of the abdominal incision). From
birth through suturing may take 30–40 minutes. Thus
the entire surgical procedure may be performed in less
than one hour.

Chagas’ disease

when the c-section involved a low transverse incision
in the uterus and there were no complications during
or after delivery.

Abnormal results
Of the hundreds of thousands of women in the
United States who undergo a c-section each year,
about 500 die from serious infections, hemorrhaging,
or other complications. These deaths may be related to
the health conditions that made the operation necessary, and not simply to the operation itself. New
research in 2004 reported that c-section delivery
affects the amount of breast milk an infant may receive
from its mother for the first five days following birth.
This can result in lower post-birth weighs as well. But
the study found that by the sixth day, mother who had
delivered by c-section began to produce milk at the
same rate as those who delivered vaginally.
Undergoing a c-section may also inflict psychological distress on the mother, beyond hormonal mood
swings and postpartum depression (‘‘baby blues’’). The
woman may feel disappointment and a sense of failure
for not experiencing a vaginal delivery. She may feel
isolated if the father or birthing coach is not with her in
the operating room, or if she is treated by an unfamiliar
doctor rather than by her own doctor or midwife. She
may feel helpless from a loss of control over labor and
delivery with no opportunity to actively participate. To
overcome these feelings, the woman must understand
why the c-section was necessary. She must accept that
she couldn’t control the unforeseen events that made
the c-section the optimum means of delivery, and recognize that preserving the health and safety of both her
and her child was more important than her delivering
vaginally. Women who undergo a c-section should
be encouraged to share their feelings with others.
Hospitals can often recommend support groups for
such mothers. Women should also be encouraged to
seek professional help if negative emotions persist.

I Chagas’ disease
Definition
Chagas’ disease is named after Dr. Carlos Chagas
who first found the organism in the early 1900s. It
involves damage to the nerves that control the heart,
digestive and other organs, and eventually leads to
damage to these organs. Worldwide, Chagas’ disease
affects over 15 million persons, and kills 50,000 each
year. Researchers believe that the parasite that causes
the disease is only found in the Americas.

Description
When a person is infected with Chagas’ disease, the
parasite known as Trypanosoma cruzi first causes a mild,
short-lived period of ‘‘acute’’ illness; then after a long
period without symptoms, the effects of the infection
begin to appear. The heart, esophagus, and colon are
most frequently involved. These organs become unable
to contract properly, and begin to stretch or dilate.

Causes and symptoms
T. cruzi is carried by insects or bugs known as
reduviid or ‘‘kissing bugs.’’ These insects are very common in Central and South America where they inhabit
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

There are three phases related to infection:


Acute phase lasts about two months, with nonspecific symptoms of low grade fever, headache, fatigue, and enlarged liver or spleen.



Indeterminate phase lasts 10–20 years, during which
time no symptoms occur, but the parasites are reproducing in various organs.



Chronic phase is the stage when symptoms related to
damage of major organs (heart, esophagus, colon)
begin.

KEY TERMS
Achalasia—An esophageal disease of unknown
cause, in which the lower sphincter or muscle is
unable to relax normally, and leads to the accumulation of material within the esophagus.
Endoscopy—Exam using an endoscope (a thin flexible tube which uses a lens or miniature camera to
view various areas of the gastrointestinal tract).
When the procedure is performed to examine certain organs such as the bile ducts or pancreas, the
organs are not viewed directly, but rather indirectly
through the injection of x ray.
Parasite—An organism that lives on or in another
and takes nourishment (food and fluids) from that
organism.
Regurgitation—Flow of material back up the esophagus and into the throat or lungs.

In the chronic phase, irregularities of heart
rhythm, heart failure, and blood clots cause weakness,
fainting, and even sudden death.
Esophageal symptoms are related to difficulty with
swallowing and chest pain. Because the esophagus does
not empty properly, food regurgitates into the lungs
causing cough, bronchitis, and repeated bouts of pneumonia. Inability to eat, weight loss, and malnutrition
become a significant factor in affecting survival.
Involvement of the large intestine (colon) causes
constipation, distention, and abdominal pain.

Diagnosis
The best way to diagnose acute infection is to
identify the parasites in tissue or blood. Occasionally
it is possible to culture the organism from infected
tissue, but this process usually requires too much
time to be of value. In the chronic phase, antibody
levels can be measured. Efforts to develop new, more
accurate tests are ongoing.

Treatment
In most cases treatment of symptoms is all that is
possible. Present medications can reduce the duration
and severity of an acute infection, but are only 50%
effective, at best, in eliminating the organisms.
Cardiac effects are managed with pacemakers and
medications. Esophageal complications require either
endoscopic or surgical methods to improve esophageal emptying, similar to those used to treat the disorder known as achalasia. Constipation is treated by
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

increasing fiber and bulk laxatives, or removal of diseased portions of the colon.

Prognosis
Those patients with gastrointestinal complications often respond to some form of treatment.
Cardiac problems are more difficult to treat, particularly since transplant would rekindle infection.

Prevention
Visitors traveling to areas of known infection
should avoid staying in mud, adobe, or similar huts.
Mosquito nets and insect repellents are useful in helping to avoid contact with the bugs. Blood screening is
not always effective in many regions where infection is
common. It is necessary to carefully screen people who
have emigrated from Central and South America
before they make blood donations.

poorly constructed houses and huts. The insects deposit
their waste material, exposing inhabitants to the parasites. The parasites then enter the body by way of a cut
or via the eyes or mouth. T. cruzi can also be transmitted by blood transfusion. Eating uncooked, contaminated food or breastfeeding can also transmit the
disease. The reduviids, in turn, become infected with
the parasite by biting infected animals and humans.

Chancroid

I Chancroid
Definition
Chancroid is a sexually transmitted disease caused
by a bacterial infection that is characterized by painful
sores on the genitals.

Description
Chancroid is an infection of the genitals that is
caused by the bacterium Haemophilus ducreyi.
Chancroid is a sexually transmitted disease, which
means that it is spread from person to person almost
always by sexual contact. However, there have been a
few cases in which healthcare providers have become
infected through contact with infected patients.
Common locations for chancroid sores (ulcers)
in men are the shaft or head of the penis, foreskin,
the groove behind the head of the penis, the opening
of the penis, and the scrotum. In women, common
locations are the labia majora (outer lips), labia
minora (inner lips), perianal area (area around the
anal opening), and inner thighs. It is rare for the
ulcer(s) to be on the vaginal walls or cervix. In
about 50% of the patients with chancroid, the infection spreads to either or both of the lymph nodes in
the groin.
Chancroid is most commonly found in developing and third world countries. In the United States,
the most common cause of genital ulcers is genital
herpes, followed by syphilis, and then chancroid.
As of 1997, there were fewer than 1,500 cases of
chancroid in the United States per year and it
occurred primarily in African Americans, Hispanic
Americans, and Native Americans. There are occasional localized outbreaks of chancroid in the United
States. In addition, the practice of exchanging sex for
drugs has lead to a link between crack cocaine use and
chancroid.
Even though the incidence of chancroid in the
United States decreased in the 1990s, there is an alarming connection between chancroid and human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV causes
AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and is
easily spread from person to person through chancroid ulcers. Uncircumcised men with chancroid
ulcers have a 48% risk of acquiring HIV from sexual
contact. Women with chancroid ulcers are also at a
greater risk of being infected with HIV during sexual
contact. Genital ulcers seem to act as doorways for
HIV to enter and exit.
808

Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)

Causes and symptoms
Haemophilus ducreyi is spread from person to person by vaginal, anal, and oral sexual contact.
Uncircumcised men are about three times more likely
than circumcised men to become infected following
exposure to Haemophilus ducreyi. Having unprotected
sex, exchanging sex for drugs, and having unprotected
sex with a prostitute are other risk factors. Many cases
of chancroid in the United States occur in persons who
had traveled to countries where the disease is more
common.
Chancroid occurs when Haemophilus ducreyi
penetrates the skin through an injury, like a scratch
or cut. Once past the skin surface, the warmth, moisture, and nutrients allow bacteria to grow rapidly. The
first sign of chancroid is a small, red papule that occurs
within three to seven days following exposure to the
bacteria, but may take up to one month. Usually
within one day, the papule becomes an ulcer. The
chancroid ulcer is painful, bleeds easily, drains a grey
or yellowish pus, and has sharply defined, ragged
edges. They can vary in size from an eighth of an
inch to two inches in diameter. Men usually have
only one ulcer, but women often have four or more.
Sometimes ‘‘kissing’’ ulcers occur when one ulcer
spreads the bacterial infection to an opposite skin surface. For example, kissing ulcers can form on the lips
of the labia majora. Alternatively, women may not
have any external sores but may experience painful
urination, intercourse, and/or bowel movements and
may have a vaginal discharge or rectal bleeding.
Signs that the infection has spread to the lymph
node appear about one week after the formation of the
genital ulcer. Lymph nodes are small organs in the
lymphatic system that filter waste materials from nearly
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis
Chancroid may be diagnosed and treated by urologists (urinary tract doctors for men), gynecologists (for
women), and infectious disease specialists. Part of the
diagnosis of chancroid involves ruling out genital
herpes and syphilis because genital ulcers are also symptoms of these diseases. The appearance of these three
diseases can be close enough to be confusing. However,
the presence of a pus-filled lump in the groin of a patient
with a genital ulcer is highly specific for chancroid.
For a clear-cut diagnosis of chancroid, Haemophilus
ducreyi must be isolated from the ulcer. To do this, a
sterile cotton swab is wiped over the ulcer to obtain a pus
sample. In the laboratory, the sample is put into special
media and placed in an incubator. Haemophilus ducreyi
takes from two to five days to grow in the laboratory. In
addition, the pus may be examined under the microscope to see which bacteria are in the ulcer. A sample
of the pus may also be tested to see if the herpes virus is
present. A blood sample will probably be taken from the
patient’s arm to test for the presence of antibodies to the
bacteria that causes syphilis.

KEY TERMS

the abdomen and the thighs.

antibiotic treatment. Severe ulcers may cause permanent scars. Severe scarring of the foreskin may require
circumcision. Urethral fistulas (abnormal passageways from the urine tube to the skin) may occur and
requires corrective surgery.

Prevention
The best prevention for chancroid is to use a condom during sexual intercourse. Chancroid can also be
prevented by abstinence (avoidance of any sexual contact) and by being in a monogamous relationship with
a disease-free partner. To prevent the spread of chancroid, it is important that all sexual contacts of the
patient are identified and treated.

Treatment
The only treatment for chancroid is antibiotics
given either once or for several days. Antibiotics
taken by mouth for one to two weeks include erythromycin (E-Mycin, Ery-Tab), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (Augmentin), co-trimoxazole (Bactrim,
Septra), or ciprofloxacin (Cipro). Antibiotics given in
one dose include ceftriaxone (Rocephin), spectinomycin (Trobicin), co-trimoxazole, or ofloxacin (Floxin).
The ulcer(s) may be cleaned and soaked to reduce
the swelling. Salt solution dressings may be applied to
the ulcer(s) to reduce the spread of the bacteria and
prevent additional ulcers. A serious infection of the
foreskin may require circumcision. Pus would be removed from infected lymph nodes by using a needle and
syringe. Very large buboes may require surgical drainage.

Without treatment, chancroid may either go away
quickly or patients may experience the painful ulcers
for many months. A complete cure is obtained with

I Charcoal, activated
Definition
Activated charcoal is a fine black odorless and
tasteless powder made from wood or other materials
that have been exposed to very high temperatures in an
airless environment. It is then treated, or activated, to
increase its ability to adsorb various substances by
reheating with oxidizing gas or other chemicals to
break it into a very fine powder. Activated charcoal
is pure carbon specially processed to make it highly
adsorbent of particles and gases in the body’s digestive
system.
809

Charcoal, activated

every organ in the body. This lymph node infection is
called ‘‘lymphadenitis’’ and the swollen, painful lymph
node is called a ‘‘bubo.’’ The bubo, which appears as a
red, spherical lump, may burst through the skin, releasing a thick pus and forming another ulcer.

Charcoal, activated

Activated charcoal has often been used since
ancient times to cure a variety of ailments including
poisoning. Its healing effects have been well documented since as early as 1550 B.C. by the Egyptians.
However, charcoal was almost forgotten until
15 years ago when it was rediscovered as a wonderful
oral agent to treat most overdoses and toxins.

Description
Activated charcoal’s most important use is for
treatment of poisoning. It helps prevent the absorption of most poisons or drugs by the stomach and
intestines. In addition to being used for most swallowed poisons in humans, charcoal has been effectively used in dogs, rabbits, rats, and other animals,
as well. It can also adsorb gas in the bowels and has
been used for the treatment of gas or diarrhea.
Charcoal’s other uses such as treatment of viruses,
bacteria, bacterial toxic byproducts, snake venoms
and other substances by adsorption have not been
supported by clinical studies. By adding water to the
powder to make a paste, activated charcoal can be
used as an external application to alleviate pain and
itching from bites and stings.
Poisons and drug overdoses
It is estimated that one million children accidentally overdose on drugs mistaken as candies or
eat, drink, or inhale poisonous household products
each year. Infants and toddlers are at the greatest
risk for accidental poisoning. Activated charcoal
is one of the agents most commonly used for these
cases. It can absorb large amounts of poisons
quickly. In addition, it is non-toxic, may be stored
for a long time, and can be conveniently administered at home. Charcoal works by binding to irritating or toxic substances in the stomach and
intestines. This prevents the toxic drug or chemical
from spreading throughout the body. The activated
charcoal with the toxic substance bound to it is
then excreted in the stool without harm to the
body. When poisoning is suspected the local poison
control center should be contacted for instructions.
They may recommend using activated charcoal,
which should be available at home so that it can
be given to the poisoned child or pet immediately.
For severe poisoning, several doses of activated
charcoal may be needed.
Activated charcoal is also used to induce vomiting
in adults who have attempted suicide by taking an
overdose of antidepressants, barbiturates, or benzodiazepine tranquilizers.
810

Intestinal disorders
In the past, activated charcoal was a popular
remedy for flatus (intestinal gas). Even before the discovery of America by Europeans, Native Americans
used powdered charcoal mixed with water to treat an
upset stomach. Although charcoal has been recommended as an alternative treatment for flatus, however,
studies done in the early 2000s have reported that it is
not particularly useful in treating intestinal gas. Such
other measures as dietary changes or biofeedback training are more effective in relieving patients’ symptoms.
Charcoal has also been used to treat such other
intestinal disorders as diarrhea, constipation, and
cramps. There are few studies to support these uses
and there are also concerns that frequent use of charcoal may decrease absorption of essential nutrients,
especially in children.
Other uses
Besides being a general antidote for poisons or
remedy for gas, activated charcoal has been used to
treat other conditions as well. Based on its ability to
adsorb or bind to other substances, charcoal has been
effectively used to clean skin wounds and to adsorb
waste materials from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, it has been used to adsorb snake venoms, viruses,
bacteria, and harmful materials excreted by bacteria or
fungi. However, because of lack of scientific studies,
these uses are not recommended. Activated charcoal,
when used together with other remedies such as aloe
vera, acidophilus, and psyllium, helps to keep symptoms of ulcerative colitis under control. While charcoal
shows some anti-aging activity in rats, it is doubtful if it
has the same effect in humans.
Apart from its medicinal applications, activated
charcoal is used by biologists to cool cell suspensions;
by public health physicians to filter disease organisms
from drinking water; and by environmental scientists
to remove organic pollutants from ocean sediments.

Recommended dosage
For poisoning
Activated charcoal is available without prescription. In cases of accidental poisoning or drug overdose,
however, one should call an emergency poison control
center, hospital emergency room, or doctor’s office for
advice. In case that both syrup of ipecac and charcoal
are recommended for treatment of the poison, ipecac
should be given first. Charcoal should not be given for
at least 30 minutes after ipecac or until vomiting from
ipecac stops. Activated charcoal is often mixed with a
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

For acute poisoning, the dosage is as follows:


Infants (under 1 year of age): 1 g/kg.



Children (1–12 years of age): 15–30 g or 1–2 g/kg
with at least 8 oz of water.



Adults: 30–100 g or 1–2 g/kg with at least 8 oz of
water.
For diarrhea or gas

A person can take charcoal tablets or capsules
with water or sprinkle the content onto foods. The
dosage for treatment of gas or diarrhea in adults is
520–975 mg after each meal and up to 5 g per day.

Precautions
Parents should keep activated charcoal on hand in
case of emergencies.
Charcoal should not be given together with syrup
of ipecac. The charcoal will adsorb the ipecac.
Charcoal should be taken 30 minutes after ipecac or
after the vomiting from ipecac stops.
Some activated charcoal products contain sorbitol.
Sorbitol is a sweetener as well as a laxative, therefore, it
may cause severe diarrhea and vomiting. These products should not be used in infants.
Charcoal may interfere with the absorption of
medications and nutrients such as vitamins or minerals. For uses other than for treatment of poisoning,
charcoal should be taken two hours after other
medications.

KEY TERMS
Antidote—A remedy to counteract a poison or
injury.
Adsorption—The binding of a chemical (e.g., drug
or poison) to a solid material such as activated
charcoal or clay.
Flatus—Gas or air in the digestive tract.

Activated charcoal may cause swelling or pain in
the stomach. A doctor should be notified immediately.
It has been known to cause problems in people with
intestinal bleeding, blockage or those people who have
had recent surgery. These patients should talk to their
doctor before using this product.
Charcoal may be less effective in people with slow
digestion.
Charcoal should not be given for more than three
or four days for treatment of diarrhea. Continuing for
longer periods may interfere with normal nutrition.
Charcoal should not be used in children under
three years of age to treat diarrhea or gas.
Activated charcoal should be kept out of reach of
children.

Side effects
Charcoal may cause constipation when taken for
a drug overdose or accidental poisoning. A laxative
should be taken after the crisis is over.
Activated charcoal may cause the stool to turn
black. This side effect is to be expected.
Patients should consult a doctor if they have pain
or swelling of the stomach.

Interactions

Charcoal should not be used to treat poisoning
caused by such corrosive products as lye or other
strong acids or petroleum products such as gasoline,
kerosene, or cleaning fluids. Charcoal may make the
condition worse and delay diagnosis and treatment. In
addition, charcoal is also not effective if the poison is
lithium, cyanide, iron, ethanol, or methanol.

Activated charcoal should not be mixed with chocolate syrup, ice cream, or sherbet to make it more
palatable. These foods prevent the charcoal from
working properly.

Parents should not mix charcoal with chocolate
syrup, sherbet, or ice cream, even though it may make
charcoal taste better. These foods may prevent charcoal from working properly.

I Charcot Marie Tooth disease
Definition
Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) is the name
of a group of inherited disorders of the nerves in the
peripheral nervous system (nerves throughout the
body that communicate motor and sensory information to and from the spinal cord) causing weakness
and loss of sensation in the limbs.
812

Description
CMT is named for the three neurologists who first
described the condition in the late 1800s. It is also
known as hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy,
and is sometimes called peroneal muscular atrophy,
referring to the muscles in the leg that are often
affected. The age of onset of CMT can vary anywhere
from young childhood to the 50s or 60s. Symptoms
typically begin by the age of 20. For reasons yet
unknown, the severity in symptoms can also vary
greatly, even among members of the same family.
Although CMT has been described for many
years, it is only since the early 1990s that the genetic
cause of many of the types of CMT have become
known. Therefore, knowledge about CMT has
increased dramatically within a short time.
The peripheral nerves
CMT affects the peripheral nerves, those groups of
nerve cells carrying information to and from the spinal
cord. CMT decreases the ability of these nerves to carry
motor commands to muscles, especially those furthest
from the spinal cord located in the feet and hands. As a
result, the muscles connected to these nerves eventually
weaken. CMT also affects the sensory nerves that carry
information from the limbs to the brain. Therefore
people with CMT also have sensory loss. This causes
symptoms such as not being able to tell if something is
hot or cold or difficulties with balance.
There are two parts of the nerve that can be
affected in CMT. A nerve can be likened to an electrical wire, in which the wire part is the axon of the
nerve and the insulation surrounding it is the myelin
sheath. The job of the myelin is to help messages travel
very fast through the nerves. CMT is usually classified
depending on which part of the nerve is affected.
People who have problems with the myelin have
CMT type 1 and people who have abnormalities of
the axon have CMT type 2.
Specialized testing of the nerves, called nerve conduction testing (NCV), can be performed to determine
if a person has CMT1 or CMT2. These tests measure
the speed at which messages travel through the nerves.
In CMT1, the messages move too slowly, but in CMT2
the messages travel at the normal speed.

Demographics
CMT has been diagnosed in people from all over
the world. It occurs in approximately one in 2,500
people, which is about the same incidence as multiple
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Causes and symptoms
CMT is caused by changes (mutations) in any one
of a number of genes that carry the instructions to
make the peripheral nerves. Genes contain the instructions for how the body grows and develops before and
after a person is born. There are probably at least 15
different genes that can cause CMT. However, as of
early 2001, many have not yet been identified.
CMT types 1 and 2 can be broken down into
subtypes based upon the gene that is causing CMT.
The subtypes are labeled by letters, so there is
CMT1A, CMT1B, etc. Therefore, the gene with a
mutation that causes CMT1A is different from that
that causes CMT1B.
Types of CMT
CMT1A. The most common type of CMT is called
CMT1A. It is caused by a mutation in a gene called
peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) located on
chromosome 17. The job of this gene is to make a
protein (PMP22) that makes up part of the myelin.
In most people who have CMT, the mutation that
causes the condition is a duplication (doubling) of
the PMP22 gene. Instead of having two copies of the
PMP22 gene (one on each chromosome) there are
three copies. It is not known how this extra copy of
the PMP22 gene causes the observed symptoms. A
small percentage of people with CMT1A do not have
a duplication of the PMP22 gene, but rather have a
point mutation in the gene. A point mutation is like a
typo in the gene that causes it to work incorrectly.
HEREDITARY NEUROPATHY WITH LIABILITY TO
PRESSURE PALSIES (HNPP). HNPP is a condition that is

also caused by a mutation in the PMP22 gene. The
mutation is a deletion. Therefore, there is only one
copy of the PMP22 gene instead of two. People who
have HNPP may have some of the signs of CMT.
However, they also have episodes where they develop
weakness and problems with sensation after compression of certain pressure points such as the elbows or
knee. Often these symptoms will resolve after a few
days or weeks, but sometimes they are permanent.
CMT1B. Another type of CMT, called CMT1B, is
caused by a mutation in a gene called myelin protein
zero (MPZ) located on chromosome 1. The job of this
gene is to make the layers of myelin stick together as
they are wrapped around the axon. The mutations in
this gene are point mutations because they involve a

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

change (either deletion, substitution, or insertion) at
one specific component of a gene.
CMTX. Another type of CMT, called CMTX, is
usually considered a subtype of CMT1 because it
affects the myelin, but it has a different type of inheritance than type 1 or type 2. In CMTX, the CMT–
causing gene is located on the X chromosome and is
called connexin 32 (Cx32). The job of this gene is to
code for a class of protein called connexins that form
tunnels between the layers of myelin.
CMT2. There are at least five different genes that
can cause CMT type 2. Therefore, CMT2 has subtypes
A, B, C, D and E. As of early 2001, scientists have
narrowed in on the location of most of the CMT2
causing genes. However, the specific genes and the
mutations have not yet been found for most types.
Very recently, the gene for CMT2E has been found.
The gene is called neurofilament-light (NF-L). Because
it has just been discovered, not much is known about
how mutations in this gene cause CMT.
CMT3. In the past a condition called DejerineSottas disease was referred to as CMT3. This is a
severe type of CMT in which symptoms begin in
infancy or early childhood. It is now known that this
is not a separate type of CMT and in fact people who
have onset in infancy or early childhood often have
mutations in the PMP22 or MPZ genes.
CMT4. CMT4 is a rare type of CMT in which the
nerve conduction tests have slow response results.
However, it is classified differently from CMT1 because
it is passed through families by a different pattern of
inheritance. There are five different subtypes and each
has only been described in a few families. The symptoms in CMT4 are often severe and other symptoms
such as deafness may be present. There are three different genes that have been associated with CMT4 as of
early 2001. They are called MTMR2, EGR2, and
NDRG1. More research is required to understand
how mutations in these genes cause CMT.

Inheritance
CMT1A and 1B, HNPP, and all of the subtypes of
CMT2 have autosomal dominant inheritance.
Autosomal refers to the first 22 pairs of chromosomes
that are the same in males and females. Therefore,
males and females are affected equally in these types.
In a dominant condition, only one gene of a pair needs
to have a mutation in order for a person to have
symptoms of the condition. Therefore, anyone who
has these types has a 50%, or one in two, chance of
passing CMT on to each of their children. This chance

neurologic condition.

is the same for each pregnancy and does not change
based on previous children.

ground when walking. Complaints of cold legs are common, as are cramps in the legs, especially after exercise.

CMTX has X-linked inheritance. Since males only
have one X chromosome, they only have one copy of
the Cx32 gene. Thus, when a male has a mutation in
his Cx32 gene, he will have CMT. However, females
have two X chromosomes and therefore have two
copies of the Cx32 gene. If they have a mutation in
one copy of their Cx32 genes, they will only have mild
to moderate symptoms of CMT that may go unnoticed. This is because their normal copy of the Cx32
gene does make normal myelin.

In many people, the fingers and hands eventually
become affected. Muscle loss in the hands can make
fine movements such as working buttons and zippers
difficult. Some patients develop tremor in the upper
limbs. Loss of sensation can cause problems such as
numbness and the inability to feel if something is hot or
cold. Most people with CMT remain able to walk
throughout their lives.

Females pass on one or the other of their X
chromosomes to their children—sons or daughters. If
a woman with a Cx32 mutation passes her normal
X chromosome, she will have an unaffected son or
daughter who will not pass CMT on to his or her
children. If the woman passes the chromosome with
Cx32 mutation on she will have an affected son or
daughter, although the daughter will be mildly affected
or have no symptoms. Therefore, a woman with a Cx32
mutation has a 50%, or a one in two, chance of passing
the mutation to her children: a son will be affected, and
a daughter may only have mild symptoms.

Diagnosis of CMT begins with a careful neurological exam to determine the extent and distribution of
weakness. A thorough family history should be taken
at this time to determine if other people in the family
are affected. Testing may also be performed to rule out
other causes of neuropathy.

When males pass on an X chromosome, they have
a daughter. When they pass on a Y chromosome, they
have a son. Since the Cx32 mutation is on the
X chromosome, a man with CMTX will always pass
the Cx32 mutation on to his daughters. However, when
he has a son, he passes on the Y chromosome, and
therefore the son will not be affected. Therefore, an
affected male passes the Cx32 gene mutation on to all
of his daughters, but to none of his sons.
CMT4 has autosomal recessive inheritance. Males
and females are equally affected. In order for a person to
have CMT4, they must have a mutation in both of their
CMT–causing genes—one inherited from each parent.
The parents of an affected person are called carriers.
They have one normal copy of the gene and one copy
with a mutation. Carriers do not have symptoms of
CMT. Two carrier parents have a 25%, or one in four,
chance of passing CMT on to each of their children.
The onset of symptoms is highly variable, even
among members of the same family. Symptoms usually
progress very slowly over a person’s lifetime. The main
problems caused by CMT are weakness and loss of
sensation mainly in the feet and hands. The first symptoms are usually problems with the feet such as high
arches and problems with walking and running.
Tripping while walking and sprained ankles are common. Muscle loss in the feet and calves leads to ‘‘foot
drop’’ where the foot does not lift high enough off the
814

Diagnosis

A nerve conduction velocity test should be performed to measure how fast impulses travel through
the nerves. This test may show characteristic features
of CMT, but it is not diagnostic of CMT. Nerve conduction testing may be combined with electromyography (EMG), an electrical test of the muscles.
A nerve biopsy (removal of a small piece of the
nerve) may be performed to look for changes characteristic of CMT. However, this testing is not diagnostic
of CMT and is usually not necessary for making a
diagnosis.
Definitive diagnosis of CMT is made only by genetic
testing, usually performed by drawing a small amount
of blood. As of early 2001, testing is available to
detect mutations in PMP22, MPZ, Cx32 and EGR2.
However, research is progressing rapidly and new testing
is often made available every few months. All affected
members of a family have the same type of CMT.
Therefore once a mutation is found in one affected
member, it is possible to test other members who may
have symptoms or are at risk of developing CMT.
Prenatal diagnosis
Testing during pregnancy to determine whether
an unborn child is affected is possible if genetic testing
in a family has identified a specific CMT-causing
mutation. This can be done after 10–12 weeks of pregnancy using a procedure called chorionic villus sampling (CVS). CVS involves removing a tiny piece of the
placenta and examining the cells. Testing can also be
done by amniocentesis after 16 weeks gestation by
removing a small amount of the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby and analyzing the cells in the fluid.

Each of these procedures has a small risk of miscarriage associated with it, and those who are interested
in learning more should check with their doctor or
genetic counselor. Couples interested in these options
should obtain genetic counseling to carefully explore
all of the benefits and limitations of these procedures.

Treatment
There is no cure for CMT. However, physical and
occupational therapy are an important part of CMT
treatment. Physical therapy is used to preserve range
of motion and minimize deformity caused by muscle
shortening, or contracture. Braces are sometimes used
to improve control of the lower extremities that can
help tremendously with balance. After wearing braces,
people often find that they have more energy because
they are using less energy to focus on their walking.
Occupational therapy is used to provide devices and
techniques that can assist tasks such as dressing, feeding, writing, and other routine activities of daily life.
Voice-activated software can also help people who
have problems with fine motor control.

The symptoms of CMT usually progress slowly
over many years, but do not usually shorten life expectancy. The majority of people with CMT do not need
to use a wheelchair during their lifetime. Most people
with CMT are able to lead full and productive lives
despite their physical challenges.

It is very important that people with CMT avoid
injury that causes them to be immobile for long periods of time. It is often difficult for people with CMT to
return to their original strength after injury.
There is a long list of medications that should be
avoided if possible by people diagnosed with CMT
such as hydralazine (Apresoline), megadoses of vitamin A, B6, and D, Taxol, and large intravenous doses
of penicillin. Complete lists are available from the
CMT support groups. People considering taking any
of these medications should weigh the risks and benefits with their physician.

Charcot’s joints is a progressive degenerative disease of the joints caused by nerve damage resulting in
the loss of ability to feel pain in the joint and instability
of the joint.

KEY TERMS

Description

Prognosis

Charcot’s joints, also called neuropathic joint disease, is the result of two conditions present in the joint.
The first factor is the inability to feel pain in the joint
due to nerve damage. The second factor is that injuries
to the joint go unnoticed leading to instability and
making the joint more susceptible to further injury.
Repeated small injuries, strains and even fractures can
go unnoticed until finally the joint is permanently
destroyed. Loss of the protective sensation of pain is
what leads to the disintegration of the joint and often
leads to deformity in the joint.

Treatment of the disease causing loss of pain perception may help to slow the damage to the joints.

Although this condition can affect any joint, the
knee is the joint most commonly involved. In individuals with diabetes mellitus, the foot is most commonly
affected. The disease can involve only one joint or it
may affect two or three joints. More than three affected
joints is very rare. In all cases, the specific joint(s)
affected depends on the location of the nerve damage.

Causes and symptoms
Many diseases and injuries can interfere with the
ability to feel pain. Conditions such as diabetes mellitus, spinal injuries and diseases, alcoholism, and even
syphilis can all lead to a loss of the ability to feel pain in
some areas. Lack of pain sensation may also be
congenital.
The symptoms of Charcot’s joints can go unnoticed for some time and may be confused with osteoarthritis in the beginning. Swelling and stiffness in a
joint without the expected pain, or with less pain than
would be expected, are the primary symptoms of this
condition. As the condition progresses, however, the
joint can become very painful due to fluid build-up
and bony growths.

Diagnosis
Charcot’s joints is suspected when a person with a
disease that impairs pain sensation exhibits painless
swelling and/or stiffness in a joint. Standard x rays will
show damage to the joint, and may also show abnormal bone growth and calcium deposits. Floating bone
fragments from previous injuries may also be visible.

Treatment
In the early stages of Charcot’s joints, braces to
stabilize the joints can help stop or minimize the
damage. When the disease has progressed beyond
braces, surgery can sometimes repair the joint. If the
damage is extensive, an artificial joint may be necessary.

I Chelation therapy
Definition
Chelation therapy is an intravenous treatment
designed to bind heavy metals in the body in order to
treat heavy metal toxicity. Proponents claim it also
treats coronary artery disease and other illnesses that
may be linked to damage from free radicals (reactive
molecules).

Purpose
The benefits of EDTA chelation for the treatment
of lead poisoning and excessively high calcium levels
are undisputed. The claims of benefits for those suffering from atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and
other degenerative diseases are more difficult to prove.
Reported uses for chelation therapy include treatment
of angina, gangrene, arthritis, multiple sclerosis,
Parkinson’s disease, psoriasis, and Alzheimer’s disease.
Improvement is also claimed for people experiencing
diminished sight, hearing, smell, coordination, and
sexual potency.

Description
Origins
The term chelation is from the Greek root word
‘‘chele,’’ meaning ‘‘claw.’’ Chelating agents, most
commonly diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), were
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

If the preparatory examination suggests that there
is a condition that could be improved by chelation
therapy, and there is no health reason why it shouldn’t
be used, then the treatment can begin. The patient is
generally taken to a comfortable treatment area,
sometimes in a group location, and an intravenous
line is started. A solution of EDTA together with
vitamins and minerals tailored for the individual
patient is given. Most treatments take three to four
hours, as the infusion must be given slowly in order to
be safe. The number of recommended treatments is
usually between 20 and 40. They are given one to three
times a week. Maintenance treatments can then be
given at the rate of once or twice a month. Maximum
benefits are reportedly attained after approximately
three months after a treatment series. The cost of
therapy is considerable, but it is a fraction of the cost
of an expensive medical procedure like cardiac bypass
surgery. Intravenous vitamin C and mercury chelation
therapies are also offered.

Preparations
A candidate for chelation therapy should initially
have a thorough history and physical to define the type
and extent of clinical problems. Laboratory tests will
be done to determine whether there are any conditions
present that would prevent the use of chelation.
Patients who have preexisting hypocalcemia, poor
liver or kidney function, congestive heart failure, hypoglycemia, tuberculosis, clotting problems, or potentially allergic conditions are at higher risk for
complications from chelation therapy. A Doppler
ultrasound may be performed to determine the adequacy of blood flow in different regions of the body.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS
Angina—Chest pain caused by reduced oxygen to
the heart.
Atherosclerosis—Arterial disease characterized by
fatty deposits on inner arterial walls.
Hypocalcemia—Low blood calcium.
Hypoglycemia—Low blood sugar.
Intermittent claudication—Leg pain and weakness
caused by walking.
Thrombophlebitis—Inflammation of a vein together
with clot formation.

Precautions
It is important for people who receive chelation
therapy to work with medical personnel who are
experienced in the use of this treatment. Treatment
should not be undertaken before a good physical, lifestyle evaluation, history, and any laboratory tests
necessary are performed. The staff must be forthcoming about test results and should answer any questions
the patient may have. Evaluation and treatment
should be individualized and involve assessment of
kidney function before each treatment with chelation,
since the metals bound by the EDTA are excreted
through the kidneys.
Although EDTA binds harmful, toxic metals like
mercury, lead, and cadmium, it also binds some essential nutrients of the body, such as copper, iron, calcium, zinc, and magnesium. Large amounts of zinc are
lost during chelation. Zinc deficiency can cause
impaired immune function and other harmful effects.
Supplements of zinc are generally given to patients
undergoing chelation, but it is not known whether
this is adequate to prevent deficiency. Also, chelation
therapy does not replace proper nutrition, exercise,
and appropriate medications or surgery for specific
diseases or conditions.

Side effects
Side effects of chelation therapy are reportedly
unusual, but are occasionally serious. Mild reactions
may include, but are not limited to, local irritation at
the infusion site, skin reactions, nausea, headache,
dizziness, hypoglycemia, fever, leg cramps, or loose
bowel movements. Some of the more serious complications reported have included hypocalcemia, kidney
damage, decreased clotting ability, anemia, bone

originally designed for industrial applications in the
early 1900s. It was not until the World War II era that
the potential for medical therapy was realized. The
initial intent was to develop antidotes to poison gas
and radioactive contaminants. The need for widespread
therapy of this nature did not materialize, but more
practical uses were found for chelation. During the
following decade, EDTA chelation therapy became
standard treatment for people suffering from lead poisoning. Patients who had received this treatment
claimed to have other health improvements that could
not be attributed to the lead removal only. Especially
notable were comments from those who had previously
suffered from intermittent claudication and angina.
They reported suffering less pain and fatigue, with
improved endurance, after chelation therapy. These
reports stimulated further interest in the potential benefits of chelation therapy for people suffering from
atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease.

marrow damage, insulin shock, thrombophlebitis with
embolism, and even rare deaths. However, some doctors feel that the latter groups of complications
occurred before the safer method currently used for
chelation therapy was developed.

Research and general acceptance
EDTA chelation is a highly controversial therapy.
The treatment is approved by the United States Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for lead poisoning
and seriously high calcium levels. However, for the
treatment of atherosclerotic heart disease, EDTA
chelation therapy is not endorsed by the American
Heart Association (AHA), the FDA, the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), or the American College
of Cardiology. The AHA reports that there are no
adequate, controlled, published scientific studies
using currently approved scientific methods to support this therapy for the treatment of coronary artery
disease. However, a pooled analysis from the results of
over 70 studies showed positive results in all but one.

material in an intervertebral disk by the injection of
an enzyme such as chymopapain.

Purpose
Between each vertebra lies a disk of cushioning
material that keeps the spinal bones from rubbing
together and absorbs some of the shock to the spine
from body movements. In the center of the disk is soft,
gelatinous material called the nucleus pulposus (NP).
The NP is surrounded by a tough fibrous coating.
Sometimes when the back is injured, this coating can
weaken and bulge or tear to allow the NP to ooze out.
When this happens, it is called a herniated nucleus
pulposus (HNP), or–in common language–a herniated
disk.
When the disk bulges or herniates, it can put
pressure on nerves which originate in the spinal column, and go to other parts of the body. This causes
lower back pain, and/or pain to the hips, legs, arms,
shoulders, and neck, depending on the location of the
herniated disk. Chemonucleolysis uses chymopapain,
an enzyme derived from papyrus, to dissolve the disk
material that has been displaced because of injury.
Herniated disks are the cause of only a small proportion of cases of lower back pain, and chemonucleolysis
is appropriate for only some cases of HNP.
Chemonucleolysis is a conservative alternative to
disk surgery. There are three types of disk injuries.
A protruded disk is one that is intact but bulging. In
an extruded disk, the fibrous wrapper has torn and the
NP has oozed out, but is still connected to the disk. In
a sequestered disk, a fragment of the NP has broken
loose from the disk and is free in the spinal canal.
Chemonucleolysis is effective on protruded and
extruded disks, but not on sequestered disk injuries.
In the United States, chymopapain chemonucleolysis
is approved only for use in the lumbar (lower) spine. In
other countries, it has also been used successfully to
treat cervical (upper spine) hernias.

if the disk is sequestered



if the patient has had several failed back operations



if a spinal cord tumor is present



if the patient has a neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis

Other conditions may affect the appropriateness
of chemonucleolysis, including hypertension, obesity,
diabetes, and a family history of stroke.

The greatest risk is that the patient may be allergic
to chymopapain. The death rate for chemonucleolysis
is only 0.02%. Complications overall are five to 10
times less than with conventional surgery, and the
failure rate is roughly comparable to the failure rate
in conventional disk surgery.

Normal results
Many patients feel immediate relief from pain,
but, in about 30% of patients, maximal relief takes
six weeks. The long term (seven to 20 years) success
rate averages about 75%, which is comparable to the
success rate for conventional surgery.

Definition
Chemotherapy is treatment of cancer with anticancer drugs.

Description
A small gauge needle is placed in the center of the
affected disk. Chymopapain is introduced into the
disk. The patient needs to remain still.

Preparation
Patients will need tests such as a myelogram or CT
scan to pinpoint the herniated disk. Some doctors
medicate the patient 24 hours prior to the operation
in order to decrease the chances of post-operative
lower back stiffness.

Aftercare
Patients may feel lower back stiffness, which goes
away in few weeks. Heavy lifting and sports activities
should be avoided for at least three months.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Purpose
The main purpose of chemotherapy is to kill cancer cells. It usually is used to treat patients with cancer
that has spread from the place in the body where it
started (metastasized). Chemotherapy destroys cancer
cells anywhere in the body. It even kills cells that have
broken off from the main tumor and traveled through
the blood or lymph systems to other parts of the body.
Chemotherapy can cure some types of cancer. In
some cases, it is used to slow the growth of cancer cells
or to keep the cancer from spreading to other parts of
the body. When a cancer has been removed by surgery,
chemotherapy may be used to keep the cancer from
coming back (adjuvant therapy). Chemotherapy also
can ease the symptoms of cancer, helping some
patients have a better quality of life.

Risks

Chemotherapy

Precautions
There are many different types of chemotherapy
drugs. Oncologists, doctors who specialize in treating
cancer, determine which drugs are best suited for each
patient. This decision is based on the type of cancer,
the patient’s age and health, and other drugs the
patient is taking. Some patients should not be treated
with certain chemotherapy drugs. Age and other conditions may affect the drugs with which a person may
be treated. Heart disease, kidney disease, and diabetes
are conditions that may limit the choice of treatment
drugs. In 2003, research revealed that obesity appears
to reduce the effectives of high-dose chemotherapy.
Researchers said further study was needed to determine the best dosage for obese patients receiving
therapy.

Description
More than 50 chemotherapy drugs are currently
available to treat cancer and many more are being
tested for their ability to destroy cancer cells. Most
chemotherapy drugs interfere with the ability of cells
to grow or multiply. Although these drugs affect all
cells in the body, many useful treatments are most
effective against rapidly growing cells. Cancer cells
grow more quickly than most other body cells. Other
cells that grow fast are cells of the bone marrow that
produce blood cells, cells in the stomach and intestines, and cells of the hair follicles. Therefore, the
most common side effects of chemotherapy are linked
to the treatment’s effects on other fast growing cells.
Types of chemotherapy drugs
Chemotherapy drugs are classified based on how
they work. The main types of chemotherapy drugs are
described below:


Alkylating drugs kill cancer cells by directly attacking DNA, the genetic material of the genes.
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating drug.



Antimetabolites interfere with the production of DNA
and keep cells from growing and multiplying. An
example of an antimetabolite is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).



Antitumor antibiotics are made from natural substances such as fungi in the soil. They interfere with
important cell functions, including production of
DNA and cell proteins. Doxorubicin and bleomycin
belong to this group of chemotherapy drugs.



Plant alkaloids prevent cells from dividing normally.
Vinblastine and vincristine are plant alkaloids
obtained from the periwinkle plant.

820



Steroid hormones slow the growth of some cancers
that depend on hormones. For example, tamoxifen is
used to treat breast cancers that depend on the hormone estrogen for growth.
Combination chemotherapy

Chemotherapy usually is given in addition to
other cancer treatments, such as surgery and radiation
therapy. When given with other treatments, it is called
adjuvant chemotherapy. An oncologist decides which
chemotherapy drug or combination of drugs will work
best for each patient. The use of two or more drugs
together often works better than a single drug for
treating cancer. This is called combination chemotherapy. Scientific studies of different drug combinations
help doctors learn which combinations work best for
each type of cancer. For example, new research in 2003
found that a combination of chemotherapy and gene
therapy stopped breast cancer and its metastasis
(spread to other organs or parts of the body).
How chemotherapy is given
Chemotherapy is administered in different ways,
depending on the drugs to be given and the type of
cancer. Doctors decide the dose of chemotherapy
drugs considering many factors, among them being
the patient’s height and weight.
Chemotherapy may be given by one or more of
the following methods:


orally



by injection



through a catheter or port



topically

Oral chemotherapy is given by mouth in the form
a pill, capsule, or liquid. This is the easiest method and
can usually be done at home.
Intravenous (IV) chemotherapy is injected into a
vein. A small needle is inserted into a vein on the hand
or lower arm. The needle usually is attached to a small
tube called a catheter, which delivers the drug to the
needle from an IV bag or bottle.
Intramuscular (IM) chemotherapy is injected into
a muscle. Chemotherapy given by intramuscular injection is absorbed into the blood more slowly than IV
chemotherapy. Because of this, the effects of IM chemotherapy may last longer than chemotherapy given
intravenously. Chemotherapy also may be injected subcutaneously (SQ or SC), which means under the skin.
Injection of chemotherapy directly into the cancer is
called intralesional (IL) injection.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Chemotherapy

Chemotherapy also may be given by a catheter or
port permanently inserted into a central vein or body
cavity. A port is a small reservoir or container that is
placed in a vein or under the skin in the area where the
drug will be given. These methods eliminate the need
for repeated injections and may allow patients to
spend less time in the hospital while receiving
chemotherapy. A common location for a permanent
catheter is the external jugular vein in the neck.
Intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy is administered
into the abdominal cavity through a catheter or port.
Chemotherapy given by catheter or port into the
spinal fluid is called intrathecal (IT) administration.
Catheters and ports also may be placed in the chest
cavity, bladder, or pelvis, depending on the location of
the cancer to be treated.
Topical chemotherapy is given as a cream or ointment applied directly to the cancer. This method is
more common in treatment of certain types of skin
cancer.
Treatment location and schedule
Patients may take chemotherapy at home, in the
doctor’s office, or as an inpatient or outpatient at the
hospital. Most patients stay in the hospital when first
beginning chemotherapy, so their doctor can check for
any side effects and change the dose if needed.
How often and how long chemotherapy is given
depends on the type of cancer, how patients respond to
the drugs, patients’ health and ability to tolerate the
drugs, and the types of drugs given. Chemotherapy
administration may take only a few minutes or may
last as long as several hours. Chemotherapy may be
given daily, weekly, or monthly. A rest period may
follow a course of treatment before the next course
begins. In combination chemotherapy, more than one
drug may be given at a time, or they may be given
alternately, one following the other.

Preparation
A number of medical tests are done before chemotherapy is started. The oncologist will determine how
much the cancer has spread from the results of x rays
and other imaging tests and from samples of the tumor
taken during surgery or biopsy.
Blood tests give the doctor important information
about the function of the blood cells and levels of
chemicals in the blood. A complete blood count
(CBC) is commonly done before and regularly during
treatment. The CBC shows the numbers of white
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets in the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

blood. Because chemotherapy affects the bone marrow, where blood cells are made, levels of these cells
often drop during chemotherapy. The white blood
cells and platelets are most likely to be affected by
chemotherapy. A drop in the white blood cell count
means the immune system cannot function properly.
Low levels of platelets can cause a patient to bleed
easily from a cut or other wound. A low red blood
cell count can lead to anemia (deficiency of red blood
cells) and fatigue.
When a chemotherapy treatment takes a long
time, the patient may prepare for it by wearing comfortable clothes. Bringing a book to read or a tape to
listen to may help pass the time and ease the stress of
receiving chemotherapy. Some patients bring a friend
or family member to provide company and support
during treatment.
Sometimes, patients taking chemotherapy drugs
known to cause nausea are given medications called
821

Chemotherapy

anti-emetics before chemotherapy is administered.
Anti-emetic drugs help to lessen feelings of nausea.
Two anti-nausea medications that may be used are
Kytril and Zofran.



easy bleeding or bruising



sores in the mouth and throat



neuropathy and other damage to the nervous system

Other ways to prepare for chemotherapy and help
lessen nausea are:



kidney damage



regularly eating nutritious foods and drinking lots of
fluids



eating and drinking normally until about two hours
before chemotherapy



eating high carbohydrate, low-fat foods and avoiding spicy foods

New research also revealed in 2003 that taking
melatonin, a natural hormone substance, may help
improve chemotherapy’s effectiveness and reduce the
toxic effects of the drugs.

Aftercare
Tips for helping to control side effects after
chemotherapy include:


Following any instructions given by the doctor or
nurse



Taking all prescribed medications



Eating small amounts of bland foods



Drinking lots of fluids



Getting plenty of rest.

Some patients find it helps to breathe fresh air or
get mild exercise, such as taking a walk.

Risks
Chemotherapy drugs are toxic to normal cells as
well as cancer cells. A dose that will destroy cancer
cells will probably cause damage to some normal cells.
Doctors adjust doses to do the least amount of harm
possible to normal cells. Some patients feel few or no
side effects, and others may have more serious side
effects. In some cases, a dose adjustment is all that is
needed to reduce or stop a side effect.
Some chemotherapy drugs have more side effects
than others. Some of the most common side effects
are:


nausea and vomiting



loss of appetite



hair loss



anemia and fatigue



infection

822

Nausea and vomiting are common, but can usually
be controlled by taking antinausea drugs, drinking
enough fluids, and avoiding spicy foods. Loss of appetite may be due to nausea or the stress of undergoing
cancer treatment.
Some chemotherapy drugs cause hair loss, but it is
almost always temporary.
Low blood cell counts caused by the effect of
chemotherapy on the bone marrow can lead to anemia, infections, and easy bleeding and bruising.
Patients with anemia have too few red blood cells to
deliver oxygen and nutrients to the body’s tissues.
Anemic patients feel tired and weak. If red blood cell
levels fall too low, a blood transfusion may be given.
Patients receiving chemotherapy are more likely
to get infections. This happens because their infectionfighting white blood cells are reduced. It is important
to take measures to avoid getting infections. When the
white blood cell count drops too low, the doctor may
prescribe medications called colony stimulating factors that help white blood cells grow. Neupogen and
Leukine are two colony stimulants used as treatments
to help fight infection.
Platelets are blood cells that make the blood clot.
When patients do not have enough platelets, they may
bleed or bruise easily, even from small injuries.
Patients with low blood platelets should take precautions to avoid injuries. Medicines such as aspirin and
other pain relievers can affect platelets and slow down
the clotting process.
Chemotherapy can cause irritation and dryness in
the mouth and throat. Painful sores may form that can
bleed and become infected. Precautions to avoid this
side effect include getting dental care before chemotherapy begins, brushing the teeth and gums regularly
with a soft brush, and avoiding mouth washes that
contain salt or alcohol.

Normal results
The main goal of chemotherapy is to cure cancer.
Many cancers are cured by chemotherapy. It may be
used in combination with surgery to keep a cancer
from spreading to other parts of the body. Some widespread, fast-growing cancers are more difficult to
treat. In these cases, chemotherapy may slow the
growth of the cancer cells.

Definition

Doctors can tell if the chemotherapy is working by
the results of medical tests. Physical examination,
blood tests, and x rays are all used to check the effects
of treatment on the cancer.
The possible outcomes of chemotherapy are:


Complete remission or response. The cancer completely disappears. The course of chemotherapy is completed and the patient is tested regularly for a
recurrence.



Partial remission or response. The cancer shrinks in
size but does not disappear. The same chemotherapy
may be continued or a different combination of
drugs may be tried.



Stabilization. The cancer does not grow or shrink.
Other therapy options may be explored. A tumor
may stay stabilized for many years.



Progression. The cancer continues to grow. Other
therapy options may be explored.



A secondary malignancy may develop from the one
being treated, and that second cancer may need additional chemotherapy or other treatment.

Chest drainage therapy involves the removal of
air, blood, pus, or other secretions from the chest
cavity.

Purpose
Chest drainage therapy is done to relieve pressure
on the lungs, and remove fluid that could promote
infection. Installing a chest drainage tube can be either
an emergency or a planned procedure.
Removing air or fluids from the chest involves the
insertion of a tube through the skin and the muscles
between the ribs, and into the chest cavity. This cavity
is also called the pleural space. Insertion of this tube is
called thoracostomy, and chest drainage therapy is
sometimes called thoracostomy tube drainage.
Conditions that may need to be treated by chest
drainage therapy include emphysema (air in the tissues
of the lungs), tuberculosis, and spontaneous pneumothorax (air in the chest cavity) that causes more than a
25% collapse of the lung. Other conditions include
cancer that causes excessive secretions, empyema (pus
in the thoracic cavity), or hemothorax (blood in the
thoracic cavity). Almost all chest drainage therapy is
done to drain blood from the chest cavity after lung or
heart surgery. In cases where the lung is collapsed,
removing fluids by chest drainage therapy allows the
lung to reinflate.
Oftentimes an x ray is performed prior to treatment to determine whether the problem is either fluid
or air in the pleural space. Sometimes a procedure
called thoracentesis is performed in an effort to avoid
inserting a chest drainage tube. In this procedure a
needle with a catheter is inserted into the pleural
space and fluid is removed. When fluid continues to

accumulate, chest drainage therapy is usually the next
step. This is especially true when there is a lung infection underlying the fluid build-up.

KEY TERMS
Empyema—Pus in the pleural cavity.

Precautions
Chest drainage therapy is not done if a collapsed
lung is not life-threatening. It also should be avoided
for patients who have blood clotting problems.

Description
Most patients are awake when the chest drainage
tube is inserted. They are given a sedative and a local
anesthetic. Chest drainage tubes are usually inserted
between the ribs. The exact location depends on the
type of material to be drained and its location in the
lungs.
An incision is made in the skin and through the
muscles between the ribs. A chest tube is inserted and
secured in place. The doctor connects one end of the
tube to the chest drainage system.
The chest drainage system must remain sealed to
prevent air from entering the chest cavity through the
tube. One commonly used system is a water-seal drainage system, comprised of three compartments that
collect and drain the fluid or air without allowing air
to backflow into the tube. An alternative to this system
is to connect the tube to a negative suction pump.
Once the tube and drainage system are in place, a
chest x ray is done to confirm that the tube is in the
right location, and that it is working. In some cases it
may be necessary to insert more than one tube to drain
localized pockets of fluid that have accumulated.

Hemothorax—Blood in the pleural cavity.
Pleural cavity—The area of the chest that includes
the lining of the chest cavity, the space the lungs are
located in, and the membrane covering of the
lungs.
Spontaneous pneumothorax—Air in the chest cavity that occurs because of disease or other naturally
occurring cause. Air and blood together in this
space is called a pneumohemothorax.

leaking into the space. If the patient is on mechanical
ventilation, the tube is often left in place until a
respirator is no longer necessary. Chest drainage therapy is usually done in conjunction with treating the
underlying cause of the fluid build-up.
The fluid that has been drained is examined for
bacterial growth, cancer cells, pus, and blood – to
determine the underlying cause of the condition and
appropriate treatment.

Risks
Problems can arise in the insertion of the tube if
the membrane lining the chest cavity is thick or if it has
many adhesions. The tube will not drain correctly if the
chest cavity contains blood clots or thick secretions
that are often associated with infections. Excessive
bleeding may occur during the insertion and positioning of the tube. Infection may result from the procedure. Pain is also a common complication.

Preparation
A chest x ray is usually done before the chest
drainage tube is inserted. Sometimes fluid becomes
trapped in isolated spaces in the lung, and it is necessary to do an ultrasound to determine where to locate
the drainage tube. Computed tomography scans (CT)
are useful in locating small pockets of fluids caused by
cancer or tuberculosis.

Normal results
The gas, pus, or blood is drained from the chest
cavity, and the lungs reinflate or begin to function
more efficiently. The site at which the tube was
inserted heals normally.
Resources
BOOKS

Aftercare
Normally after the material has been removed
from the chest cavity and the situation is resolved,
the chest drainage tube is removed. In cases where
the reason for the tube was air in the pleural cavity,
the tube is clamped and left in place several hours
before it is removed to make sure no more air is

Chest physical therapy is the term for a group of
treatments designed to improve respiratory efficiency,
promote expansion of the lungs, strengthen respiratory muscles, and eliminate secretions from the
respiratory system.

Purpose
The purpose of chest physical therapy, also called
chest physiotherapy, is to help patients breathe more
freely and to get more oxygen into the body. Chest
physical therapy includes postural drainage, chest percussion, chest vibration, turning, deep breathing exercises, and coughing. It is usually done in conjunction
with other treatments to rid the airways of secretions.
These other treatments include suctioning, nebulizer
treatments, and the administration of expectorant
drugs.
Chest physical therapy can be used with newborns, infants, children, and adults. People who benefit from chest physical therapy exhibit a wide range of
problems that make it difficult to clear secretions from
their lungs. Some people who may receive chest physical therapy include people with cystic fibrosis or
neuromuscular diseases like Guillain-Barré syndrome,
progressive muscle weakness (myasthenia gravis), or
tetanus. People with lung diseases such as bronchitis,
pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) also benefit from chest physical therapy.
People who are likely to aspirate their mucous secretions because of diseases such as cerebral palsy or
muscular dystrophy also receive chest physical therapy,
as do some people who are bedridden, confined to a
wheelchair, or who cannot breathe deeply because of
postoperative pain.

Chest physical therapy

I Chest physical therapy



Description
Chest physical therapy can be performed in a
variety of settings including critical care units, hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient clinics, and at the
patient’s home. Depending on the circumstances,
chest physical therapy may be performed by anyone
from a respiratory care therapist to a trained member
of the patient’s family. Different patient conditions
warrant different levels of training.
Chest physical therapy consists of a variety of
procedures that are applied depending on the patient’s
health and condition. Hospitalized patients are reevaluated frequently to establish which procedures are
most effective and best tolerated. Patients receiving
long term chest physical therapy are reevaluated
about every three months.
Turning
Turning from side to side permits lung expansion.
Patients may turn themselves or be turned by a caregiver. The head of the bed is also elevated to promote
drainage if the patient can tolerate this position.
Critically ill patients and those dependent on mechanical respiration are turned once every one to two hours
around the clock.
Coughing
Coughing helps break up secretions in the lungs so
that the mucus can be suctioned out or expectorated.
Patients sit upright and inhale deeply through the
nose. They then exhale in short puffs or coughs.
Coughing is repeated several times a day.
Deep breathing
Deep breathing helps expand the lungs and forces
better distribution of the air into all sections of the
lung. The patient either sits in a chair or sits upright in
bed and inhales, pushing the abdomen out to force
maximum amounts of air into the lung. The abdomen
is then contracted, and the patient exhales. Deep
breathing exercises are done several times each day
for short periods.
825

Chest physical therapy

Postural drainage
Postural drainage uses the force of gravity to
assist in effectively draining secretions from the lungs
and into the central airway where they can either be
coughed up or suctioned out. The patient is placed in a
head or chest down position and is kept in this position
for up to 15 minutes. Critical care patients and those
depending on mechanical ventilation receive postural
drainage therapy four to six times daily. Percussion
and vibration may be performed in conjunction with
postural drainage.
Percussion
Percussion is rhythmically striking the chest wall
with cupped hands. It is also called cupping, clapping,
or tapotement. The purpose of percussion is to break
up thick secretions in the lungs so that they can be
more easily removed. Percussion is performed on each
lung segment for one to two minutes at a time.
Vibration
As with percussion, the purpose of vibration is to
help break up lung secretions. Vibration can be either
mechanical or manual. It is performed as the patient
breathes deeply. When done manually, the person performing the vibration places his or her hands against the
patient’s chest and creates vibrations by quickly contracting and relaxing arm and shoulder muscles while
the patient exhales. The procedure is repeated several
times each day for about five exhalations.

Preparation
The only preparation needed for chest physical
therapy is an evaluation of the patient’s condition
and determination of which chest physical therapy
techniques would be most beneficial.

Aftercare
Patients practice oral hygiene procedures to lessen
the bad taste or odor of the secretions they spit out.

Risks
Risks and complications associated with chest
physical therapy depend on the health of the patient.
Although chest physical therapy usually poses few
problems, in some patients it may cause

Chest radiography see Chest x ray

I Chest x ray
Definition
A chest x ray is a procedure used to evaluate
organs and structures within the chest for symptoms
of disease. Chest x rays include views of the lungs,
heart, small portions of the gastrointestinal tract, thyroid gland and the bones of the chest area. X rays are a
form of radiation that can penetrate the body and
produce an image on an x–ray film. Another name
for x ray is radiograph.

Chest films are frequently ordered to diagnose or
rule out pneumonia. Other pulmonary disorders such
as emphysema or pneumothorax (presence of air or gas
in the chest cavity outside the lungs) may be detected
or evaluated through the use of chest x ray.
Cancer
A chest x ray may be ordered by a physician to
check for possible tumors of the lungs, thyroid, lymphoid tissue, or bones of the thorax. These may be
primary tumors. X rays also check for secondary
spread of cancer from one organ to another.
Cardiac disorders
While less sensitive than echocardiography, chest
x ray can be used to check for disorders such as congestive heart failure or pulmonary edema.
Other
Tuberculosis can be observed on chest x rays, as
can cardiac disease and damage to the ribs or lungs.
Chest x rays are used to see foreign bodies that may
have been swallowed or inhaled, and to evaluate
response to treatment for various diseases. Often the
chest x ray is also used to verify correct placement of
chest tubes or catheters.

Precautions
Pregnant women, particularly those in the first or
second trimester, should not have chest x rays unless
absolutely necessary. If the exam is ordered, women
who are, or could possibly be, pregnant must wear a
protective lead apron. Because the procedure involves
radiation, care should always be taken to avoid overexposure, particularly for children. However, the
amount of radiation from one chest x ray procedure
is minimal.

Risks
The only risk associated with chest x ray is minimal
exposure to radiation, particularly for pregnant women
and children. Those patients should use protective lead
aprons during the procedure. Technologists are cautioned to carefully check possible dislodging of any
tubes or monitors in the chest area from the patient’s
placement during the exam.

Normal results
A radiologist, or physician specially trained in the
technique and interpretation of x rays, will evaluate
the results. A normal chest x ray will show normal
structures for the age and medical history or the
patient. Findings, whether normal or abnormal, will
be provided to the referring physician in the form of a
written report.

patient stand for this exam, particularly when studying collection of fluid in the lungs.
During the actual time of exposure, the technologist will ask the patient to hold his or her breath. It is
very important in taking a chest x ray to ensure there is
no motion that could detract from the quality and
sharpness of the film image. The procedure will only
take a few minutes and the time patients must hold
their breaths is a matter of a few seconds.
The chest x ray may be performed in a physician’s
office or referred to an outpatient radiology facility or
hospital radiology department. In some cases, particularly for bedridden patients, a portable chest x ray may
be taken. Portable films are sometimes of poorer quality
than those taken with permanent equipment, but are the
best choice for some patients or situations. Bedridden
patients may be placed in as upright a position as possible to get a clear picture, particularly of chest fluid.

Preparation
There is no advance preparation necessary for
chest x rays. Once the patient arrives at the exam
area, a hospital gown will replace all clothing on the
upper body and all jewelry must be removed.

Aftercare
No aftercare is required by patients who have
chest x rays.
828

Abnormal findings on chest x rays are used in
conjunction with a physician’s physical exam findings,
patient medical history and other diagnostic tests to
reach a final diagnosis. For many diseases, chest x rays
are more effective when compared to previous chest
studies. The patient is asked to help the radiology
facility in locating previous chest radiographs from
other facilities.
Pulmonary disorders
Pneumonia shows up on radiographs as patches
and irregular areas of density (from fluid in the lungs).
If the bronchi, which are usually not visible, can
be seen, a diagnosis of bronchial pneumonia may
be made. Shifts or shadows in the hila (lung roots)
may indicate emphysema or a pulmonary abscess.
Widening of the spaces between ribs suggests emphysema. Other pulmonary diseases may also be detected
or suspected through chest x ray.
Cancer
In nearly all patients with lung cancer, some sort
of abnormality can be seen on a chest radiograph.
Hilar masses (enlargements at that part of the lungs
where vessels and nerves enter) are one of the more
common symptoms as are abnormal masses and fluid
buildup on the outside surface of the lungs or surrounding areas. Interstitial lung disease, which is a
large category of disorders, many of which are related
to exposure of substances (such as asbestos fibers),
may be detected on a chest x ray as fiberlike deposits,
often in the lower portions of the lungs.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Bronchi—Plural of bronchus. The air passages in
the lungs through which inhaled air passes on its
way to the lungs.
Diaphragm—The large muscle that is located
between the abdomen and the chest area. The diaphragm aids in breathing.
Gastrointestinal—The digestive organs and structures, including the stomach and intestines.
Interstitial lung disease—About 180 diseases fall
into this category of breathing disorders. Injury or
foreign substances in the lungs (such as asbestos
fibers) as well as infections, cancers, or inherited
disorders may cause the diseases. They can lead to
breathing or heart failure.
Lymphoid—Tissues relating to the lymphatic system. A thin, yellowish fluid, called lymph fluid,
travels throughout the body. The lymphatic system
helps control fluids in the body.
Portable chest x ray—An x ray procedure taken by
equipment that can be brought to the patient. The
resulting radiographs may not be as high in quality
as stationary x ray radiographs, but allow a technologist to come to the bedridden patient.
Pulmonary—Refers to the lungs and the breathing
system and function.
Serial x rays—A number of x rays performed at set
times in the disease progression or treatment intervals. The radiographs will be compared to one
another to track changes.
Sternum—Also referred to as the breast bone, this is
the long flat bone in the middle of the chest.
Thorax—The chest area, which runs between the
abdomen and neck and is encased in the ribs.
X ray—A form of electromagnetic radiation with
shorter wavelengths than normal light. X rays can
penetrate most structures.

Other
Congestive heart failure and other cardiac diseases may be indicated on the view of a heart and
lung in a chest radiograph. Fractures of the sternum
and ribs are usually easily detected as breaks on the
chest x ray. In some instances, the radiologist’s view of
the diaphragm may indicate an abdominal problem.
Tuberculosis can also be indicated by elevation of the
diaphragm. Foreign bodies which may have been

swallowed or inhaled can usually be located by the
radiologist as they will look different from any other
tissue or structure in the chest. Serial chest x rays may
be ordered to track changes over a period of time.

I Chickenpox
Definition
Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a common
and extremely infectious childhood disease that also
affects adults on occasion. It produces an itchy, blistery rash that typically lasts about a week and is sometimes accompanied by a fever or other symptoms.
A single attack of chickenpox almost always brings lifelong immunity against the disease. Because the symptoms of chickenpox are easily recognized and in most
cases merely unpleasant rather than dangerous, treatment can almost always be carried out at home. Severe
complications can develop, however, and professional
medical attention is essential in some circumstances.

Description
Before the varicella vaccine (Varivax) was
released for use in 1995, nearly all of the four million
children born each year in the United States contracted chickenpox, resulting in hospitalization in
five of every 1,000 cases and 100 deaths. Chickenpox
is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (a member of the
herpes virus family), which is spread through the air or
by direct contact with an infected person. Once someone has been infected with the virus, an incubation
period of about 10–21 days passes before symptoms
begin. The period during which infected people are
able to spread the disease is believed to start one or
two days before the rash breaks out and to continue
until all the blisters have formed scabs, which usually
829

KEY TERMS

Chickenpox

happens four to 7 days after the rash breaks out but
may be longer in adolescents and adults. For this
reason, doctors recommend keeping children with
chickenpox away from school for about a week. It is
not necessary, however, to wait until all the scabs have
fallen off.
Chickenpox has been a typical part of growing up
for most children in the industrialized world (although
this may change if the new varicella vaccine becomes
more widely accepted). The disease can strike at any
age, but by ages nine or 10 about 80–90% of American
children have already been infected. U.S. children living in rural areas and many foreign-born children are
less likely to be immune. Because almost every case of
chickenpox, no matter how mild, leads to lifelong
protection against further attacks, adults account for
less than 5% of all cases in the United States. Study
results reported by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) indicate that more than 90% of
American adults are immune to the chickenpox virus.
Adults, however, are much more likely than children
to suffer dangerous complications. More than half of
all chickenpox deaths occur among adults.

Causes and symptoms
A case of chickenpox usually starts without warning or with only a mild fever and a slight feeling of
unwellness. Within a few hours or days small red spots
begin to appear on the scalp, neck, or upper half of the
trunk. After a further 12–24 hours the spots typically
become itchy, fluid-filled bumps called vesicles, which
continue to appear in crops for the next two to five
days. In any area of skin, lesions of a variety of stages
can be seen. These blisters can spread to cover much of
the skin, and in some cases also may be found inside
the mouth, nose, ears, vagina, or rectum. Some people
develop only a few blisters, but in most cases the
number reaches 250–500. The blisters soon begin to
form scabs and fall off. Scarring usually does not
occur unless the blisters have been scratched and
become infected. Occasionally a minor and temporary
darkening of the skin (called hyperpigmentation) is
noticed around some of the blisters. The degree of
itchiness can range from barely noticeable to extreme.
Some chickenpox sufferers also have headaches,
abdominal pain, or a fever. Full recovery usually
takes five to 10 days after the first symptoms appear.
Again, the most severe cases of the disease tend to be
found among older children and adults.
Although for most people chickenpox is no more
than a matter of a few days’ discomfort, some groups
are at risk for developing complications, the most
830

common of which are bacterial infections of the blisters, pneumonia, dehydration, encephalitis, and
hepatitis:


Infants. Complications occur much more often
among children less than one year old than among
older children. The threat is greatest to newborns,
who are more at risk of death from chickenpox than
any other group. Under certain circumstances, children born to mothers who contract chickenpox just
prior to delivery face an increased possibility of dangerous consequences, including brain damage and
death. If the infection occurs during early pregnancy,
there is a small (less than 5%) risk of congenital
abnormalities.



Immunocompromised children. Children whose
immune systems have been weakened by a genetic
disorder, disease, or medical treatment usually
experience the most severe symptoms of any group.
They have the second-highest rate of death from
chickenpox.



Adults and children 15 and older. Among this group,
the typical symptoms of chickenpox tend to strike
with greater force, and the risk of complications is
much higher than among young children.

Immediate medical help should always be sought
when anyone in these high-risk groups contracts the
disease.

Diagnosis
Where children are concerned, especially those
with recent exposure to the disease, diagnosis can
usually be made at home, by a school nurse, or by a
doctor over the telephone if the child’s parent or caregiver is unsure that the disease is chickenpox.
A doctor should be called immediately if:


The child’s fever goes above 102  F (38.9  C) or takes
more than four days to disappear.



The child’s blisters appear infected. Signs of infection
include leakage of pus from the blisters or excessive
redness, warmth, tenderness, or swelling around the
blisters.



The child seems nervous, confused, unresponsive, or
unusually sleepy; complains of a stiff neck or severe
headache; shows signs of poor balance or has trouble
walking; finds bright lights hard to look at; is having
breathing problems or is coughing a lot; is complaining of chest pain; is vomiting repeatedly; or is having
convulsions. These may be signs of Reye’s syndrome
or encephalitis, two rare but potentially dangerous
conditions.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Chickenpox

Treatment
With children, treatment usually takes place in the
home and focuses on reducing discomfort and fever.
Because chickenpox is a viral disease, antibiotics are
ineffective against it.
Applying wet compresses or bathing the child in
cool or lukewarm water once a day can help the itch.
Adding four to eight ounces of baking soda or one or
two cups of oatmeal to the bath is a good idea (oatmeal bath packets are sold by pharmacies). Only mild
soap should be used in the bath. Patting, not rubbing,
is recommended for drying the child off, to prevent
irritating the blisters. Calamine lotion (and some other
kinds of lotions) also help to reduce itchiness. Because
scratching can cause blisters to become infected and
lead to scarring, the child’s nails should be cut short.
Of course, older children need to be warned not to
scratch. For babies, light mittens or socks on the
hands can help guard against scratching.
If mouth blisters make eating or drinking an
unpleasant experience, cold drinks and soft, bland
foods can ease the child’s discomfort. Painful genital
blisters can be treated with an anesthetic cream recommended by a doctor or pharmacist. Antibiotics often
are prescribed if blisters become infected.
Fever and discomfort can be reduced by acetaminophen or another medication that does not contain
aspirin. Aspirin and any medications that contain
aspirin or other salicylates must not be used with
chickenpox, for they appear to increase the chances
of developing Reye’s syndrome. The best idea is to
consult a doctor or pharmacist if unsure about which
medications are safe.

disease is the rash that is evident on the girl’s back and neck.

Immunocompromised chickenpox sufferers are
sometimes given an antiviral drug called acyclovir
(Zovirax). Studies have shown that Zovirax also lessens the symptoms of otherwise healthy children and
adults who contract chickenpox, but the suggestion
that it should be used to treat the disease among
the general population, especially in children, is
controversial.

herbal preparations of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and calendula (Calendual officinalis) to the blisters.
Homeopathic remedies are selected on a case by case
basis. Some common remedy choices are tartar emetic
(antimonium tartaricum), windflower (pulsatilla), poison ivy (Rhus toxicodendron), and sulphur.

Alternative treatment
Alternative practitioners seek to lessen the discomfort and fever caused by chickenpox. Like other
practitioners, they suggest cool or lukewarm baths.
Rolled oats (Avena sativa) in the bath water help
relieve itching. (Oats should be placed in a sock, that
is turned in the bath water to release the milky antiitch properties.) Other recommended remedies for
itching include applying aloe vera, witch hazel, or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Prognosis
Most cases of chickenpox run their course within
a week without causing lasting harm. However, there
is one long-term consequence of chickenpox that
strikes about 20% of the population, particularly people 50 and older. Like all herpes viruses, the varicellazoster virus never leaves the body after an episode
of chickenpox, but lies dormant in the nerve cells,
where it may be reactivated years later by disease or
831

Chickenpox

age-related weakening of the immune system. The
result is shingles (also called herpes zoster), a painful
nerve inflammation, accompanied by a rash, that
usually affects the trunk or the face for 10 days or
more. Especially in the elderly, pain, called postherpetic neuralgia, may persist at the site of the shingles for
months or years. Two relatively newer drugs for treatment of shingles have become available. Both valacyclovir (Valtrex) and famciclovir (Famvir) stop the
replication of herpes zoster when administered within
72 hours of appearance of the rash. The effectiveness
of these two drugs in immunocompromised patients
has not been established, and Famvir was not recommended for patients under 18 years.

Prevention
A substance known as varicella-zoster immune
globulin (VZIG), which reduces the severity of
chickenpox symptoms, is available to treat immunocompromised children and others at high risk of developing complications. It is administered by injection
within 96 hours of known or suspected exposure to
the disease and is not useful after that. VZIG is produced as a gamma globulin from blood of recently
infected individuals.
A vaccine for chickenpox became available in the
United States in 1995 under the name Varivax. Varivax
is a live, attenuated (weakened) virus vaccine. It has
been proven to be 85% effective for preventing all cases
of chickenpox and close to 100% effective in preventing
severe cases. Side effects are normally limited to occasional soreness or redness at the injection site. CDC
guidelines state that the vaccine should be given to all
children (with the exception of certain high-risk groups)
at 12–18 months of age, preferably when they receive
their measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. For older children, up to age 12, the CDC recommends vaccination
when a reliable determination that the child in question
has already had chickenpox cannot be made.
Vaccination also is recommended for any older child
or adult considered susceptible to the disease, particularly those, such as health care workers and women of
childbearing age, who face a greater likelihood of severe
illness or transmitting infection. A single dose of the
vaccine was once thought sufficient for children up to
age 12; older children and adults received a second dose
four to eight weeks later. However, an outbreak at a
daycare center in 2000 brought concern in the medical
community about a second vaccination for younger
children, since many of the affected children had been
vaccinated. Researchers began recommending a second
vaccination in 2002. In 1997 the cost of two adult doses

Although this cost was not always covered by health
insurance plans, children up to age 18 without access to
the appropriate coverage could be vaccinated free of
charge through the federal Vaccines for Children
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The vaccine also is not recommended for pregnant
women, and women should delay pregnancy for three
months following a complete vaccination. The vaccine
is useful when given early after exposure to chickenpox and, if given in the midst of the incubation period,
it can be preventative. The Infectious Diseases Society
of America stated in 2000 that immunization is recommended for all adults who have never had chickenpox.
While there was initial concern regarding the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness when first released, the
vaccination is gaining acceptance as numerous states
require it for admittance into daycare or public school.
In 2000, 59% of toddlers in the United States were
immunized; up from 43.2% in 1998. A study published
in 2001 indicates that the varicella vaccine is highly
effective when used in clinical practice. Although evidence has not ruled out a booster shot later in life, all
research addressing the vaccine’s effectiveness throughout its six-year use indicates that chickenpox may be the
first human herpes virus to be wiped out. Although initial
concerns questioned if the vaccination might make shingles more likely, studies are beginning to show the effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing cases of that disease.

I Child abuse
Definition
Child abuse is the blanket term to describe four
types of child mistreatment: physical abuse, sexual
abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect. In many cases
children are the victims of more than one type of
abuse. The abusers can be parents or other family
members, caretakers such as teachers and babysitters,
acquaintances (including other children), and (in rare
instances) strangers.

Description
Prevalence of abuse
Child abuse was once viewed as a minor social
problem affecting only a handful of United States
children. However, it has begun to closer attention
from the media, law enforcement, and the helping
professions. With increased public and professional
awareness has come a sharp rise in the number of
reported cases. But because abuse often is hidden
from view and its victims too young or fearful to
speak out, experts suggest that its true prevalence is
possibly much greater than the official data indicate.
In 1996, more than three million victims of alleged
abuse were reported to child protective services
(CPS) agencies in the United States, and the reports
were substantiated in more than one million cases. Put
another way, 1.5% of the country’s children were
confirmed victims of abuse in 1996. Parents were the
abusers in 77% of the confirmed cases, other relatives
in 11%. Sexual abuse was more likely to be committed
by males, whereas females were responsible for the
majority of neglect cases. More than 1,000 United
States children died from abuse in 1996. A 2004 report
said that nearly 17% of adult women and 8% of adult
men had been abused as children. The United Nations
Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported in early 2004
that nearly 3,500 children younger than age 15 die
every year from physical abuse and neglect in the 27
richest nations in the world.

Child abuse

program. Varivax is not given to patients who already
have overt signs of the disease. It was once thought
unsafe for children with chronic kidney disease, but a
2003 report said the vaccination was safe in these children. The finding is important, since even chickenpox
can be a serious complication in children who must
undergo a kidney transplant.

Child abuse

Although experts are quick to point out that abuse
occurs among all social, ethnic, and income groups,
reported cases usually involve poor families with little
education. Young mothers, single-parent families, and
parental alcohol or drug abuse also are common in
reported cases. Charles F. Johnson remarks, ‘‘More
than 90% of abusing parents have neither psychotic
nor criminal personalities. Rather they tend to be
lonely, unhappy, angry, young, and single parents
who do not plan their pregnancies, have little or no
knowledge of child development, and have unrealistic
expectations for child behavior.’’ About 10%, or perhaps as many as 40%, of abusive parents were themselves physically abused as children, but most abused
children do not grow up to be abusive parents.
Types of abuse
PHYSICAL ABUSE. Physical abuse is the nonacciden-

tal infliction of physical injury to a child. The abuser is
usually a family member or other caretaker, and is more
likely to be male. In 1996, 24% of the confirmed cases
of United States child abuse involved physical abuse.
A rare form of physical abuse is Munchausen syndrome by proxy, in which a caretaker (most often the
mother) seeks attention by making the child sick or
appear to be sick.
SEXUAL ABUSE. Charles F. Johnson defines child
sexual abuse as ‘‘any activity with a child, before the
age of legal consent, that is for the sexual gratification of
an adult or a significantly older child.’’ It includes,
among other things, sexual touching and penetration,
persuading a child to expose his or her sexual organs,
and allowing a child to view pornography. In most cases
the child is related to or knows the abuser, and about
one in five abusers are themselves underage. Sexual
abuse was present in 12% of the confirmed 1996 abuse
cases. An estimated 20–25% of females and 10–15% of
males report that they were sexually abused by age 18.

involving rejection, scapegoating, belittlement, and so
forth. Because it often accompanies other types of
abuse and is difficult to prove, it is rarely reported, and
accounted for only 6% of the confirmed 1996 cases.
NEGLECT. Neglect—failure to satisfy a child’s basic
needs—can assume many forms. Physical neglect is the
failure (beyond the constraints imposed by poverty) to
provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, or supervision. Emotional neglect is the failure to satisfy a child’s
normal emotional needs, or behavior that damages a
child’s normal emotional and psychological development (such as permitting drug abuse in the home).
Failing to see that a child receives proper schooling or
medical care is also considered neglect. In 1996 neglect
was the finding in 52% of the confirmed abuse cases.

Causes and symptoms
Physical abuse
The usual physical abuse scenario involves a parent who loses control and lashes out at a child. The
trigger may be normal child behavior such as crying or
dirtying a diaper. Unlike nonabusive parents, who
may become angry at or upset with their children
from time to time but are genuinely loving, abusive
parents tend to harbor deep-rooted negative feelings
toward their children.
Unexplained or suspicious bruises or other marks
on the skin are typical signs of physical abuse, as are
burns. Skull and other bone fractures are often seen in
young abused children, and in fact, head injuries are the
leading cause of death from abuse. Children less than
one year old are particularly vulnerable to injury from
shaking. This is called shaken baby syndrome or shaken
impact syndrome. Not surprisingly, physical abuse also
causes a wide variety of behavioral changes in children.
Sexual abuse

The 1990s and early 2000s were rocked by reports
of sexual abuse of children committed by Catholic
priests. Most of the abuse appeared to have occurred
during the 1970s and a prominent report released early
in 2004 stated that as many as 10,667 children were
sexually abused by more than 4,300 priests. Increases
also have been seen in recent years in child pornography cases, where children are the subjects of pornography, particularly on the Internet.

John M. Leventhal observes, ‘‘The two prerequisites for this form of maltreatment include sexual arousal to children and the willingness to act on this arousal.
Factors that may contribute to this willingness include
alcohol or drug abuse, poor impulse control, and a belief
that the sexual behaviors are acceptable and not harmful to the child.’’ The chances of abuse are higher if the
child is developmentally handicapped or vulnerable in
some other way.

EMOTIONAL ABUSE. Emotional abuse, according to
Richard D. Krugman, ‘‘has been defined as the rejection,
ignoring, criticizing, isolation, or terrorizing of children,
all of which have the effect of eroding their self-esteem.’’
Emotional abuse usually expresses itself in verbal attacks

Genital or anal injuries or abnormalities (including
the presence of sexually transmitted diseases) can be
signs of sexual abuse, but often there is no physical
evidence for a doctor to find. In fact, physical examinations of children in cases of suspected sexual abuse

Although these signs do not necessarily indicate that a child has been abused, they may help adults recognize that something is wrong. The possiblity of abuse should
be investigated if a child shows a number of these symptoms, or any of them to a marked degree:
Sexual Abuse
Being overly affectionate or knowledgeable in a sexual way inappropriate to the child’s age
Medical problems such as chronic itching, pain in the genitals, venereal diseases
Other extreme reactions, such as depression, self-mutilation, suicide attempts, running away, overdoses, anorexia
Personality changes such as becoming insecure or clinging
Regressing to younger behavior patterns such as thumb sucking or bringing out discarded cuddly toys
Sudden loss of appetite or compulsive eating
Being isolated or withdrawn
Inability to concentrate
Lack of trust or fear someone they know well, such as not wanting to be alone with a babysitter
Starting to wet bed again, day or night/nightmares
Become worried about clothing being removed
Suddenly drawing sexually explicit pictures
Trying to be ‘‘ultra-good’’ or perfect; overreacting to criticism
Physical Abuse
Unexplained recurrent injuries or burns
Improbable excuses or refusal to explain injuries
Wearing clothes to cover injuries, even in hot weather
Refusal to undress for gym
Bald patches
Chronic running away
Fear of medical help or examination
Self-destructive tendencies
Aggression towards others
Fear of physical contact—shrinking back if touched
Admitting that they are punished, but the punishment is excessive (such as a child being beaten every night to ‘‘make him/her study’’)
Fear of suspected abuser being contacted
Emotional Abuse
Physical, mental, and emotional development lags
Sudden speech disorders
Continual self-depreciation (‘‘I’m stupid, ugly, worthless, etc.’’)
Overreaction to mistakes
Extreme fear of any new situation
Inappropriate response to pain (‘‘I deserve this’’)
Neurotic behavior (rocking, hair twisting, self-mutilation)
Extremes of passivity or aggression
Neglect
Constant hunger
Poor personal hygiene
No social relationships
Constant tiredness
Poor state of clothing
Compulsive scavenging Emaciation
Untreated medical problems
Destructive tendencies
A child may be subjected to a combination of different kinds of abuse. It is also possible that a child may show no outward signs and hide what is happening from everyone.

suicidal conduct are some of the behavioral signs of
sexual abuse, but are also found in children suffering
other kinds of stress. Excessive masturbation and other
unusually sexualized kinds of behavior are more closely
associated with sexual abuse itself.
Emotional abuse
Emotional abuse can happen in many settings: at
home, at school, on sports teams, and so on. Some of

the possible symptoms include loss of self-esteem,
sleep disturbances, headaches or stomach aches,
school avoidance, and running away from home.
Neglect
Many cases of neglect occur because the parent
experiences strong negative feelings toward the child.
At other times, the parent may truly care about the
child, but lack the ability or strength to adequately
provide for the child’s needs because he or she is
handicapped by depression, drug abuse, mental retardation, or some other problem.

Child Abuse: Signs And Symptoms

Child abuse

Neglected children often do not receive adequate
nourishment or emotional and mental stimulation.
As a result, their physical, social, emotional, and
mental development is hindered. They may, for
instance, be underweight, develop language skills less
quickly than other children, and seem emotionally
needy.

Diagnosis
Doctors and many other professionals who work
with children are required by law to report suspected
abuse to their state’s Child Protective Services (CPS)
agency. Abuse investigations often are a group effort
involving medical personnel, social workers, police officers, and others. Some hospitals and communities maintain child protection teams that respond to cases of
possible abuse. Careful questioning of the parents is
crucial, as is interviewing the child (if he or she is capable
of being interviewed). The investigators must ensure,
however, that their questioning does not further traumatize the child. A physical examination for signs of
abuse or neglect is, of course, always necessary, and
may include x rays, blood tests, and other procedures.

Treatment
Notification of the appropriate authorities, treatment of the child’s injuries, and protecting the child
from further harm are the immediate priorities in
abuse cases. If the child does not require hospital
treatment, protection often involves placing him or
her with relatives or in foster care. Once the immediate
concerns are dealt with, it becomes essential to determine how the child’s long-term medical, psychological, educational, and other needs can best be met, a
process that involves evaluating not only the child’s
needs but also the family’s (such as for drug abuse
counseling or parental skills training). If the child has
brothers or sisters, the authorities must determine
whether they have been abused as well. On investigation, signs of physical abuse are discovered in about
20% of the brothers and sisters of abused children.

Prognosis
Child abuse can have lifelong consequences.
Research shows that abused children and adolescents
are more likely, for instance, to do poorly in school,
suffer emotional problems, develop an antisocial personality, become promiscuous, abuse drugs and alcohol, and attempt suicide. As adults they often have
trouble establishing intimate relationships. Whether
professional treatment is able to moderate the long836

term psychological effects of abuse is a question that
remains unanswered.

Prevention
Government efforts to prevent abuse include
home-visitor programs aimed at high-risk families
and school-based efforts to teach children how
to respond to attempted sexual abuse. Emotional
abuse prevention has been promoted through the
media.
When children reach age three, parents should
begin teaching them about ‘‘bad touches’’ and about
confiding in a suitable adult if they are touched or
treated in a way that makes them uneasy. Parents also
need to exercise caution in hiring babysitters and
other caretakers. Anyone who suspects abuse should
immediately report those suspicions to the police or
his or her local CPS agency, which will usually be
listed in the blue pages of the telephone book under
Rehabilitative Services or Child and Family Services,
or in the yellow pages. Round-the-clock crisis counseling for children and adults is offered by the
Childhelp USA/IOF Foresters National Child
Abuse Hotline. The National Committee to Prevent
Child Abuse is an excellent source of information on
the many support groups and other organizations
that help abused and at-risk children and their
families. One of these organizations, National
Parents Anonymous, sponsors 2,100 local self-help
groups throughout the United States, Canada, and
Europe. Telephone numbers for its local groups are
listed in the white pages of the telephone book under
Parents Anonymous or can be obtained by calling the
national headquarters.

Stage 1: Dilation of the cervix

I Childbirth

Stage 1: Dilation of the cervix. (Illustration by Hans & Cassady.)

Definition
Childbirth includes both labor (the process of
birth) and delivery (the birth itself); it refers to the
entire process as an infant makes its way from the
womb down the birth canal to the outside world.

Description
Childbirth usually begins spontaneously, about
280 days after conception, but it may be started
by artificial means if the pregnancy continues past
42 weeks gestation. The average length of labor is
about 14 hours for a first pregnancy and about eight
hours in subsequent pregnancies. However, many
women experience a much longer or shorter labor.
Labor can be described in terms of a series of
phases.
First stage of labor
During the first phase of labor, the cervix dilates
(opens) from 0–10 cm. This phase has an early, or
latent, phase and an active phase. During the latent
phase, progress is usually very slow. It may take quite
a while and many contractions before the cervix
dilates the first few centimeters. Contractions increase
in strength as labor progresses. Most women are relatively comfortable during the latent phase and walking
around is encouraged, since it naturally stimulates the
process.
As labor begins, the muscular wall of the uterus
begins to contract as the cervix relaxes and expands. As
a portion of the amniotic sac surrounding the baby is
pushed into the opening, it bursts under the pressure,
releasing amniotic fluid. This is called ‘‘breaking the
bag of waters.’’
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

During a contraction, the infant experiences
intense pressure that pushes it against the cervix, eventually forcing the cervix to stretch open. At the same
time, the contractions cause the cervix to thin. During
this first stage, a woman’s contractions occur more
and more often and last longer and longer. The doctor
or nurse will do a periodic pelvic exam to determine
how the mother is progressing. If the contractions
aren’t forceful enough to open the cervix, a drug may
be given to make the uterus contract.
As pain and discomfort increase, women may be
tempted to request pain medication. If possible,
though, administration of pain medication or anesthetics should be delayed until the active phase of
labor begins—at which point the medication will not
act to slow down or stop the labor.
The active stage of labor is faster and more efficient than the latent phase. In this phase, contractions
are longer and more regular, usually occurring about
every two minutes. These stronger contractions are
also more painful. Women who use the breathing
exercises learned in childbirth classes find that these
can help cope with the pain experienced during this
phase. Many women also receive some pain medication at this point—either a short-term medication,
such as Nubain or Numorphan, or an epidural
anesthesia.
As the cervix dilates to 8–9 cm, the phase called
the transition begins. This refers to the transition from
the first phase (during which the cervix dilates from
0–10 cm) and the second phase (during which the baby
is pushed out through the birth canal). As the baby’s
head begins to descend, women begin to feel the urge
to ‘‘push’’ or bear down. Active pushing by the mother
837

Childbirth

should not begin until the second phase, since pushing
too early can cause the cervix to swell or to tear and
bleed. The attending healthcare practitioner should
counsel the mother on when to begin to push.
Second stage of labor
As the mother enters the second stage of labor,
her baby’s head appears at the top of the cervix.
Uterine contractions get stronger. The infant passes
down the vagina, helped along by contractions of the
abdominal muscles and the mother’s pushing. Active
pushing by the mother is very important during this
phase of labor. If an epidural anesthetic is being used,
many practitioners recommend decreasing the
amount administered during this phase of labor so
that the mother has better control over her abdominal muscles
When the top of the baby’s head appears at the
opening of the vagina, the birth is nearing completion.
First the head passes under the pubic bone. It fills the
lower vagina and stretches the perineum (the tissues
between the vagina and the rectum). This position is
called ‘‘crowning,’’ since only the crown of the head is
visible. When the entire head is out, the shoulders
follow. The attending practitioner suctions the
baby’s mouth and nose to ease the baby’s first breath.
The rest of the baby usually slips out easily, and the
umbilical cord is cut.
Episiotomy
As the baby’s head appears, the perineum may
stretch so tight that the baby’s progress is slowed
down. If there is risk of tearing the mother’s skin, the
doctor may choose to make a small incision into the
perineum to enlarge the vaginal opening. This is called
an episiotomy. If the woman has not had an epidural
or pudendal block, she will get a local anesthetic to
numb the area. Once the episiotomy is made, the baby
is born with a few pushes.
Third stage
In the final stage of labor, the placenta is pushed
out of the vagina by the continuing uterine contractions. The placenta is pancake shaped and about
10 inches in diameter. It has been attached to the
wall of the uterus and has served to convey nourishment from the mother to the fetus throughout the
pregnancy. Continuing uterine contractions cause it
to separate from the uterus at this point. It is important that all of the placenta be removed from the
uterus. If it is not, the uterine bleeding that is normal
after delivery may be much heavier.

Breech presentation
Approximately 4% of babies are in what is called
the ‘‘breech’’ position when labor begins. In breech
presentation, the baby’s head is not the part pressing
against the cervix. Instead the baby’s bottom or legs
are positioned to enter the birth canal instead of the
head. An obstetrician may attempt to turn the baby to
a head down position using a technique called version.
This is only successful approximately half the time.
The risks of vaginal delivery with breech presentation are much higher than with a head-first presentation. The mother and attending practitioner will need
to weigh the risks and make a decision on whether to
deliver via a cesarean section or attempt a vaginal
birth. The extent of the risk depends to a great extent
on the type of breech presentation, of which there are
three. Frank breech (the baby’s legs are folded up
against its body) is the most common and the safest
for vaginal delivery. The other types are complete
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Even in complete breech, other factors should be
met before considering a vaginal birth. An ultrasound
examination should be done to be sure the baby does
not have an unusually large head and that the head is
tilted forward (flexed) rather than back (hyperextended). Fetal monitoring and close observation of
the progress of labor are also important. A slowing
of labor or any indication of difficulty in the body
passing through the pelvis should be an indication
that it is safer to consider a cesarean section.
Forceps delivery
If the labor is not progressing as it should or if the
baby appears to be in distress, the doctor may opt for a
forceps delivery. A forceps is a spoon-shaped device
that resembles a set of salad tongs. It is placed around
the baby’s head so the doctor can pull the baby gently
out of the vagina.
Forceps can be used after the cervix is fully
dilated, and they might be required if:


the umbilical has dropped down in front of the baby
into the birth canal



the baby is too large to pass through the birth canal
unaided



the baby shows signs of stress



the mother is too exhausted to push

Before placing the forceps around the baby’s
head, pain medication or anesthesia may be given to
the mother. The doctor may use a catheter to empty
the mother’s bladder, and may clean the perineal area
with soapy water. Often an episiotomy is done before a
forceps birth, although tears can still occur.
The obstetrician slides half of the forceps at a time
into the vagina and around the side of the baby’s head
to gently grasp the head. When both ‘‘tongs’’ are in
place, the doctor pulls on the forceps to help the baby
through the birth canal as the uterus contracts.
Sometimes the baby can be delivered this way after
the very next contraction.
The frequency of forceps delivery varies from one
hospital to the next, depending on the experience of
staff and the types of anesthesia offered at the hospital.
Some obstetricians accept the need for a forceps delivery as a way to avoid cesarean birth. However, other
obstetrical services do not use forceps at all.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Complications from forceps deliveries can occur.
Sometimes they may cause nerve damage or temporary bruises to the baby’s face. When used by an experienced physician, forceps can save the life of a baby in
distress.
Vacuum-assisted birth
This method of helping a baby out of the birth
canal was developed as a gentler alternative to forceps.
Vacuum-assisted birth can only be used after the cervix is fully dilated (expanded), and the head of the
fetus has begun to descend through the pelvis. In this
procedure, the doctor uses a device called a vacuum
extractor, placing a large rubber or plastic cup against
the baby’s head. A pump creates suction that gently
pulls on the cup to ease the baby down the birth canal.
The force of the suction may cause a bruise on the
baby’s head, but it fades away in a day or so.
The vacuum extractor is not as likely as forceps to
injure the mother, and it leaves more room for the
baby to pass through the pelvis. However, there may
be problems in maintaining the suction during the
vacuum-assisted birth, so forceps may be a better
choice if it is important to remove the baby quickly.
Cesarean sections
A cesarean section, also called a c-section, is a
surgical procedure in which incisions are made
through a woman’s abdomen and uterus to deliver
her baby.
Cesarean sections are performed whenever abnormal conditions complicate labor and vaginal delivery,
threatening the life or health of the mother or the
baby. In 2002, just over 26% of babies were born by
c-section, an increase of 7% from the previous year.
The procedure may be used in cases where the
mother has had a previous c-section and the area of
the incision has been weakened. Dystocia, or difficult
labor, is the another common reason for performing a
c-section.
Difficult labor is commonly caused by one of the
three following conditions: abnormalities in the
mother’s birth canal; abnormalities in the position of
the fetus; abnormalities in the labor, including weak or
infrequent contractions.
Another major factor is fetal distress, a condition
where the fetus is not getting enough oxygen. Fetal
brain damage can result from oxygen deprivation.
Fetal distress is often related to abnormalities in the
position of the fetus, or abnormalities in the birth canal,
causing reduced blood flow through the placenta.
839

Childbirth

breech (in which the baby’s legs are crossed under and
in front of the body) and footling breech (in which one
leg or both legs are positioned to enter the birth canal).
These are not considered safe to attempt vaginal
delivery.

Childbirth

Other conditions also can make c-section advisable, such as vaginal herpes, hypertension (high blood
pressure) and diabetes in the mother. Some parents
choose to have a c-section because they fear the pain or
unpredictability of labor or they want to avoid pelvic
damage.

Causes and symptoms
One of the first signs of approaching childbirth
may be a ‘‘bloody show,’’ the appearance of a small
amount of blood-tinged mucus released from the cervix as it begins to dilate. This is called the ‘‘mucus
plug.’’
The most common sign of the onset of labor is
contractions. Sometimes women have trouble telling
the difference between true and false labor pains.
True labor pains:


develop a regular pattern, with contractions coming
closer together



last from 15–30 seconds at the onset and get progressively stronger and longer (up to 60 seconds)



may get stronger with physical activity



occur high up on the abdomen, radiating throughout
the abdomen and lower back

Another sign that labor is beginning is the breaking of the ‘‘bag of waters,’’ the amniotic sac which had
cushioned the baby during the pregnancy. When it
breaks, it releases water in a trickle or a gush. Only
about 10% of women actually experience this water
flow in the beginning of labor, however. Most of the
time, the rupture occurs sometime later in labor. If the
amniotic sac doesn’t rupture on its own, the doctor
will break it during labor.
Some women have diarrhea or nausea as labor
begins. Others notice a sudden surge of energy and
the urge to clean or arrange things right before labor
begins; this is known as ‘‘nesting.’’

Diagnosis
The onset of labor can be determined by measuring how much the cervix has dilated. The degree of
dilation is estimated by feeling the opening cervix
during a pelvic exam. Dilation is measured in centimeters, from zero to 10. Contractions that cause the
cervix to dilate are the sign of true labor.
Fetal monitoring
Fetal monitoring is a process in which the baby’s
heart rate is monitored for indicators of stress during
840

labor and birth. There are several types of fetal
monitoring.
A special stethoscope called a fetoscope may be
used. This is a simple and non-invasive method.
The Doppler method uses ultrasound; it involves
a handheld listening device that transmits the sounds
of the heart rate through a speaker or into an attached
ear piece. It can usually pick up the heart sounds
12 weeks after conception. This method offers intermittent monitoring. It allows the mother freedom to
move about and is also useful during contractions.
Electronic fetal monitoring uses ultrasound and
provides a view of the heartbeat in relationship to the
mother’s contractions. It can be used either continuously or intermittently. It is often used in high risk
pregnancies, and is not often recommended for low
risk ones because it renders the mother immobile and
requires interpretation.
Internal monitoring does not use ultrasound, is
more accurate than electronic monitoring and provides continuous monitoring for the high risk mother.
This requires the mother’s water to be broken and that
she be two to three centimeters dilated. It is used in
high-risk situations only.
Telemetry monitoring is the newest type of monitoring. It uses radio waves transmitted from an instrument on the mother’s thigh. The mother is able to
remain mobile. It provides continuous monitoring
and is used in high-risk situations.

Treatment
Most women choose some type of pain relief during childbirth, ranging from relaxation and imagery to
drugs. The specific choice may depend on what’s available, the woman’s preferences, her doctor’s recommendations, and how the labor is proceeding. All
drugs have some risks and some advantages.
Regional anesthetics
Regional anesthetics include epidurals and
spinals. In this technique, medication is injected into
the space around the spinal nerves. Depending on the
type of medications used, this type of anesthesia can
block nerve signals, causing temporary pain relief, or a
loss of sensation from the waist down. An epidural or
spinal block can provide complete pain relief during
cesarean birth.
An epidural is placed with the woman lying on her
side or sitting up in bed with the back rounded to
allow more space between the vertebrae. Her back is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

This type of anesthesia provides complete pain
relief, and can help conserve a woman’s energy, since
she can relax or even sleep during labor. This type of
anesthesia requires an IV and fetal monitor. It may be
harder for a woman to bear down when it comes time
to push, although the amount of anesthesia can be
adjusted as this stage nears.
Spinal anesthesia operates on the same principle
as epidural anesthesia, and is used primarily in cases of
c-section delivery. It is administered in the same way as
an epidural, but the catheter is not left in place. The
amount of anesthetic injected is large, since it must be
injected at one time. Because of the anesthetic’s effect
on motor nerves, most women using it cannot push
during delivery. This is a disadvantage in labor, but
not an issue during a c-section. Spinals provide quick
and strong anesthesia and allow for major abdominal
surgery with almost no pain.
Narcotics
Short-acting narcotics can ease pain and do not
interfere with a woman’s ability to push. However,
they can cause sedation, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Narcotics cross the placenta and may slow down a
baby’s breathing; they can’t be given too close to the
time of delivery.
Natural childbirth and preparation for childbirth
There are several methods to prepare for childbirth. The one selected often depends on what is available through the healthcare provider. Overall, family
involvement is receiving increased attention by the
healthcare systems, and many hospitals now offer
birthing rooms and maternity centers to help the entire
family. There are several choices available for childbirth preparation.
Lamaze, or Lamaze-Pavlov, is the most common
in the United States today. It was the first popular
natural childbirth method, becoming popular in the
1960s. Breathing exercises and concentration on a
focal point are practiced to allow mothers to control
pain while maintaining consciousness. This allows the
flow of oxygen to the baby and to the muscles in the
uterus to be maintained. A partner coaches the mother
throughout the birthing process.

KEY TERMS
Amniotic sac—The membranous sac that surrounds the embryo and fills with watery fluid as
pregnancy advances.
Breech birth—Birth of a baby bottom-first, instead
of the usual head first delivery. This can add to
labor and delivery problems because the baby’s
bottom doesn’t mold a passage through the birth
canal as well as does the head.
Cervix—A small cylindrical organ about an inch or so
long and less than an inch around that makes up the
lower part and neck of the uterus. The cervix separates
the body and cavity of the uterus from the vagina.
Embryo—The unborn child during the first eight
weeks of its development following conception.
Gestation—The period from conception to birth,
during which the developing fetus is carried in the
uterus.
Perineum—The area between the thighs that lies
behind the genital organs and in front of the anus.
Placenta—The organ that develops in the uterus
during pregnancy and that links the blood supplies
of mother and baby.

The Read method, named for Dick Read, is a
technique of breathing that was originated in the
1930s to help mothers deal with apprehension and
tension associated with childbirth. This natural childbirth method uses different breathing for the different
stages of childbirth.
The LeBoyer method stresses a relaxed delivery
in a quiet, dim room. It attempts to avoid overstimulation of the baby and to foster mother-child bonding
by placing the baby on the mother’s abdomen and
having the mother massage him or her immediately
after the birth. Then the father washes the baby in a
warm bath.
The Bradley method is called father-coached
childbirth, because it focuses on the father serving as
coach throughout the process. It encourages normal
activities during the first stages of labor.

certain high risk groups.)

The flu vaccine has been added in recent years and
has been recommended for childhood caregivers. It
is not recommended for children younger than
six months of age. A combined vaccine called the
Hexavac includes the vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus,
pertussis, poliomyelitis, H. influenza B, and hepatitis B
in one dose. In clinical trials in 2004, it was shown to be
safe and effective in young children.
Some immunizations may cause mild side effects,
or more rarely, serious adverse reactions. However,
the benefits of immunization greatly outweigh the
incidence of health problems arising from them.
There are serious chronic diseases and health problems that are frequently diagnosed in childhood and
cannot be vaccinated against. These include, but are
not limited to, asthma, type I diabetes (juvenile diabetes), leukemia, hemophilia, and cystic fibrosis.
Mental health
Children who have difficulty in areas of language
acquisition, cognitive development, and behavior control may be suffering from mental illness. Mental
health problems that may afflict children include:


Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
According to the AAP, 4–12% of school-aged children have ADHD, a condition characterized by poor
impulse control and excessive motor activity.



Learning disorders. Learning disabilities affect one in
10 school children.



Depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. Affective,

are recommended at ages two, three, four, five, six,
eight, 10, and annually thereafter through age 21.
In addition, an immunization schedule should be
followed to protect against disease and infection. As of
2004, the AAP and the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) recommended that the following
childhood immunizations be administered by age two:

school at Yale University in 1925, and transferred to
Columbia University’s College of Physicians and
Surgeons in 1927. Spock had decided well before starting
his medical studies that he would "work with children,
who have their whole lives ahead of them" and so, upon
taking his M.D. degree in 1929 and serving his general
internship at the prestigious Presbyterian Hospital, he specialized in pediatrics at a small hospital crowded with

Navy. The book sharply broke with the authoritarian
tone and rigorous instructions found in earlier generations
of baby-care books, most of which said to feed infants on a
strict schedule and not to pick them up when they cried.
Spock, who spent ten years trying to reconcile his psychoanalytic training with what mothers were telling him about
their children, told his readers, ‘‘You know more than you
think you do. . . . Don’t be afraid to trust your own common
sense. . . . Take it easy, trust your own instincts, and follow
the directions that your doctor gives you.’’ The response
was overwhelming. Baby and Child Care rapidly became

of 70 or below and impairments in adaptive functioning are considered mentally retarded.

Factors which can have a negative impact on the
emotional and social well-being of children include:


Violence. Bullying can cause serious damage to a
child’s sense of self-esteem and personal safety, as
can experiences with school violence.



Family turmoil. Divorce, death, and other lifechanging events that alter the family dynamic can
have a serious impact on a child. Even a positive
event such as the birth of a sibling or a move to a new
city and school can put emotional strain on a child.



Stress. The pressure to perform well academically
and in extracurricular activities such as sports can
be overwhelming to some children.

Peer pressure. Although it can have a positive
impact, peer pressure is often a source of significant
stress for children. This is particularly true in adolescence when ‘‘fitting in’’ seems all-important.

about drug and alcohol use is essential.


Negative sexual experiences. Sexual abuse and
assault can emotionally scar a child and instill negative feelings about sexuality and relationships.

Causes and symptoms
Childhood health problems may be congenital
(i.e., present at birth) or acquired through infection,
immune system deficiency, or another disease process.
They may also be caused by physical trauma (e.g., a
car accident or a playground fall) or a toxic substance
(e.g., an allergen, drug, or poisonous chemical), or
triggered by genetic or environmental factors.
Physical and mental health problems in childhood
can cause a wide spectrum of symptoms. However, the
following behaviors frequently signify a larger emotional, social, or mental disturbance:


signs of alcohol and drug use



falling grades



lack of interest in activities that were previously
enjoyable to the child



excessive anxiety



persistent, prolonged depression



withdrawal from friends and family



violence



temper tantrums or inappropriate displays of anger



self-inflicted injury



bizarre behavior and/or speech





sexual promiscuity



The causes of developmental disorders and delays
and learning disabilities are not always fully understood. Pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) and
844

autistic spectrum disorder (more commonly known as
autism) are characterized by unresponsiveness and
severe impairments in one or more of the following
areas:


Social interaction. Autistic children are often unaware of acceptable social behavior and are withdrawn and socially isolated. They frequently do not
like physical contact.



Communication and language. A child with autism
or PDD may not speak or may display limited or
immature language skills.



Behavior. Autistic or PDD children may have difficulty dealing with anger, can be self-injurious, and
may display obsessive behavior.

Autism is associated with brain abnormalities, but
the exact mechanisms that trigger the disorder are
yet to be determined. It has been linked to certain
congenital conditions such as neurofibromatosis, fragile X syndrome, and phenylketonuria (PKU).

Diagnosis
Physical, intellectual, emotional, and social
maturation are all important markers of a child’s overall health and well-being. When evaluating children,
pediatricians and child-care specialists assess related
skill sets, such as a child’s acquisition and use of
language, fine and gross motor skills, cognitive
growth, and socialization, and achievement of certain
milestones in these areas. A developmental milestone
is a task or skill set that a child is expected to reach
at a certain age or stage of life. For example, by age
one, most children have achieved the physical milestone of walking with the assistance of an adult.
Developmental disorders may be identified and/or
diagnosed by physicians, teachers, child psychologists,
therapists, counselors, and other professionals who
interact with children on a regular basis.
It is important to remember that all children are
unique, and develop at different paces within this
broad framework. Reaching a milestone early or late
does not necessarily indicate a developmental problem. However, if a child is consistently lagging on
achieving milestones, or has a significant deficit in one
developmental area, he or she may be experiencing
developmental delays.
Pediatricians and other medical professionals
typically diagnose physical illness and disease in children. In cases of illness and injury, children will
undergo a thorough physical examination and patient
history. Diagnostic tests may be performed as appropriate. In cases of mental or emotional disorders, a
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment
Medications may be prescribed to treat certain
childhood illnesses. Proper dosage is particularly
important with infants and children, as medications
such as acetaminophen can be toxic in excessive
amounts. Parents and caregivers should always follow
the instructions for use that accompany medications,
and inform the child’s pediatrician if the child is taking
any other drugs or vitamins to prevent potentially
negative drug interactions. Any side effects or adverse
reactions to medication should be reported to the
child’s physician. If antibiotics are prescribed, the full
course should always be taken.
Other treatments for childhood illness and/or
injuries include, but are not limited to, nutritional
therapy, physical therapy, respiratory therapy, medical devices (e.g., hearing aids, glasses, braces), and in
some cases, surgery.
Counseling is typically a front-line treatment for
psychological disorders. Therapy approaches include
psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, behavioral therapy,
family counseling, and group therapy. Therapy or
counseling may be administered by social workers,
nurses, licensed counselors and therapists, psychologists, or psychiatrists. Psychoactive medication may
also be prescribed for symptom relief in children and
adolescents with mental disorders.
Support groups may also provide emotional support for children with chronic illnesses or mental disorders. This approach, which allows individuals to
seek advice and counsel from others in similar circumstances, can be extremely effective, especially in older
children who look toward their peers for guidance and
support.
Speech therapy may be helpful to children with
developmental delays in language acquisition.
Children with learning disorders can benefit from special education therapy.

Alternative treatment
Therapeutic approaches that encourage selfdiscovery and empowerment may be useful in treating some childhood emotional traumas and mental
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

disorders. Art therapy, the use of the creative process
to express and understand emotion, encompasses a
broad range of humanistic disciplines, including visual
arts, dance, drama, music, film, writing, literature, and
other artistic genres. It can be particularly effective in
children who may have difficulty gaining insight to
emotions and thoughts they are otherwise incapable
of expressing.
Certain mild herbal remedies may also be safely
used with children, such as ginger (Zingiber officinale)
tea for nausea and aloe vera salve for burns. Parents
and caregivers should always consult their healthcare
provider before administering herbs to children.

Prognosis
The prognosis for childhood health problems varies widely. In general, early detection and proper treatment can greatly improve the odds of recovery from
many childhood ailments.
Some learning disabilities and mild developmental disorders can be overcome or greatly improved
through the therapies discussed above. However, as
of early 2001, there was no known medical treatment
or pharmacological therapy that is capable of completely eliminating all of the symptoms associated with
pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), autism
spectrum disorder, and mental retardation. Mental
illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder
are also chronic, lifelong disorders, although their
symptoms can often be well-controlled with
medication.

Prevention
Parents can take some precautions to ensure the
safety of their children. Childproofing the home, following a recommended immunization schedule, educating kids on safety, learning CPR, and taking kids
for regular well-child check-ups can help to protect
against physical harm. In addition, encouraging open
communication with children can help them grow
both emotionally and socially. Providing a loving
and supportive home environment can help to nurture
an emotionally healthy child who is independent, selfconfident, socially skilled, insightful, and empathetic
towards others.
Because they are still developing motor skills, kids
can be particularly accident prone. Observing the following safety rules can help protect children from
injury:

Children’s health

gear when riding a bike, scooter, or similar equipment or participating in sports. They should also ride
on designated bike paths whenever possible, and
learn bicycle safety rules (i.e., ride with traffic, use
hand signals).


Playground safety. Swing sets and other outdoor
play equipment should be well-maintained have at
least 12 in (30 cm) of loose fill materials (e.g., sand,
wood chips) underneath to cushion falls, and children should always be properly supervised at play.



Staying apprised of recalls. Children’s toys, play
equipment, and care products are frequently
involved in product recalls. The U.S. Consumer
Safety Products Commission (CSPC) is the agency
responsible for tracking these recalls (see Resources
below).



Staying safe in the car. Up to 85% of children’s car
seats are improperly installed and/or used. Infants
should always be in a rear-facing car seat until they
are over 12 months of age and weigh more than 20 lb
(9 kg). An infant or car seat should never be put in a
front passenger seat that has an air bag. Once they
outgrow their forward facing car seats, children
between the ages of four and eight who weigh
between 40–80 lb (18–36 kg) should ride in a booster
seat. Every child who rides in a car over this age and
weight should buckle up with a properly fitted lap
and shoulder belt.



Teaching children pedestrian safety. Younger children should never be allowed to cross the street by
themselves, and older kids should know to follow
traffic signs and signals, cross the street at the corner,
and look both ways before stepping off the curb.



Teaching children about personal safety. Kids
should know what to do in case they get lost or are
approached by a stranger. It is also imperative that
parents talk openly with their children about their
body and sexuality, and what behavior is inappropriate, to protect them against sexual predators.

Child-proofing the household is also an important
step toward keeping kids healthy. To make a house a
safe home, parents and caregivers should:


Ban guns. Accidental shootings in the home injure an
estimated 1,500 children under age 14 each year. If a
gun must be in the home, it should be securely locked
in a tamper proof box or safe.



Keep all matches, lighters, and flammable materials
properly stored and out of the reach of children.



Make sure hot water heaters are set to 120 degrees or
below to prevent scalding injuries.

846



Equip the home with working fire extinguishers and
smoke alarms, and teach children what to do in case
of fire.



Secure all medications (including vitamins, herbs,
and supplements), hazardous chemicals, and poisonous substances (including alcohol and tobacco).

Keep small children away from poisonous plants
outdoors, and remove any indoor plants that are
toxic.



Post the phone numbers of poison control and the
pediatrician near the phone, and teach children
about dialing 9-1-1 for emergencies.



Children under age five should never be left alone in
the bathtub, wading pool, or near any standing water
source (including an open toilet). Drowning is the
leading cause of death by injury for children between
the ages of one and four.

Remove lead paint. Lead is a serious health hazard
for children, and houses built before 1978 should be
tested for lead paint. If lead is found, the paint should
be removed using the appropriate safety precautions.

These safety guidelines are not all-inclusive, and
there are many age-specific safety precautions that
parents and guardians of children should observe.
For example, infants should never be left with a
propped-up bottle in their mouths or given small
play items because of the choking hazards involved.

I Chiropractic
Definition
Chiropractic is from Greek words meaning done
by hand. It is grounded in the principle that the body
can heal itself when the skeletal system is correctly
aligned and the nervous system is functioning properly. To achieve this, the practitioner uses his or her
hands or an adjusting tool to perform specific manipulations of the vertebrae. When these bones of the
spine are not correctly articulated, resulting in a condition known as subluxation, the theory is that nerve
transmission is disrupted and causes pain in the back,
as well as other areas of the body.
Chiropractic is one of the most popular alternative
therapies currently available. Some would say it now
qualifies as mainstream treatment as opposed to complementary medicine. Chiropractic treatment is covered
by many insurance plans and in 2004, the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs announced full inclusion of chiropractic care for veterans. It has become
well-accepted treatment for acute pain and problems of
the spine, including lower back pain and whiplash.
Applications beyond that scope are not supported by
current evidence, although there are ongoing studies
into the usefulness of chiropractic for such problems
as ear infections, dysmenorrhea, infant colic, migraine
headaches, and other conditions.

Purpose
Most people will experience back pain at some time
in their lives. Injuries due to overexertion and poor
posture are among the most common. Depending on
the cause and severity of the condition, options for
treatment may include physical therapy, rest, medications, surgery, or chiropractic care. Chiropractic treatment carries none of the risks of surgical or
pharmacologic treatment. Practitioners use a holistic
approach to health. The goal is not merely to relieve
the present ailment, but to analyze the cause and recommend appropriate changes of lifestyle to prevent the
problem from occurring again. They believe in a risk/
benefit analysis before use of any intervention. The odds

D A N I E L P A L M E R (1845–1913)
Chiropractic inventor, Daniel David Palmer, was
born on March 7, 1845, in Toronto, Ontario. He was
one of five siblings, the children of a shoemaker and his
wife, Thomas and Katherine Palmer. Daniel Palmer and
his older brother fell victim to wanderlust and left Canada
with a tiny cash reserve in April 1865. They immigrated to
the United States on foot, walking for 30 days before
arriving in Buffalo, New York. They traveled by boat
through the St. Lawrence Seaway to Detroit, Michigan.
There they survived by working odd jobs and sleeping on
the dock. Daniel Palmer settled in What Cheer, Iowa,
where he supported himself and his first wife as a grocer
and fish peddler in the early 1880s. He later moved to
Davenport, Iowa, where he raised three daughters and
one son.

nine years he investigated the relationship between magnetism and disease. Palmer felt that there was one thing
that caused disease. He was intent upon discovering this
one thing, or as he called it: the great secret.

Palmer was a man of high curiosity. He investigated a
variety of disciplines of medical science during his lifetime, many of which were in their infancy. He was intrigued by phrenology and assorted spiritual cults, and for

died in California in 1913; he was destitute. His son,
Bartlett Joshua Palmer, successfully commercialized the
practice of chiropractic.

of an adverse outcome are extremely low. Chiropractic
has proven in several studies to be less expensive than
many more traditional routes such as outpatient physical therapy. Relief from some neuromuscular problems
is immediate, although a series of treatments is likely
to be required to maintain the improvement. Spinal
manipulation is an excellent option for acute lower
back pain, and may also relieve neck pain as well as
other musculoskeletal pain. Although most back pain
will subside eventually with no treatment at all, chiropractic treatment can significantly shorten the time it
takes to get relief. Some types of headache can also be
successfully treated by chiropractic.

through the spinal canal, and areas that are poorly
aligned or under stress can cause physical symptoms
both in the spine and in other areas of the body. Thus
the body has the innate intelligence to heal itself when
unencumbered by spinal irregularities causing nerve
interference. After his success with Lillard, other
patients began coming to him for care, and responded
well to adjustments. This resulted in Palmer’s further
study of the relationship between an optimally functional spine and normal health.

Description
Origins
Spinal manipulation has a long history in many
cultures but Daniel D. Palmer is the founder of modern chiropractic theory, dating back to the 1890s.
A grocer and magnetic healer, he applied his knowledge of the nervous system and manual therapies in an
unusual situation. One renowned story concerns
Harvey Lillard, a janitor in the office where Palmer
worked. The man had been deaf for 17 years, ever
since he had sustained an injury to his upper spine.
Palmer performed an adjustment on a painful vertebra
in the region of the injury and Lillard’s hearing was
reputedly restored. Palmer theorized that all communication from the brain to the rest of the body passes
848

In September 1895, Palmer purported to have cured a
deaf man by placing pressure on the man’s displaced
vertebra. Shortly afterward Palmer claimed to cure another
patient of heart trouble, again by adjusting a displaced
vertebra. The double coincidence led Palmer to theorize
that human disease might be the result of dislocated or
luxated bones, as Palmer called them. That same year he
established the Palmer School of Chiropractic where he
taught a three-month course in the simple fundamentals of
medicine and spinal adjustment.

Palmer founded the first chiropractic college in
1897. His son, B. J. Palmer, continued to develop
chiropractic philosophy and practice after his father’s
death. B. J. and other faculty members were divided
over the role of subluxation in disease. B. J. saw it as
the cause of all disease. The others disagreed and
sought a more rational way of thinking, thus broadening the base of chiropractic education. From 1910 to
1920, many other chiropractic colleges were established. Other innovators, including John Howard,
Carl Cleveland, Earl Homewood, Joseph Janse,
Herbert Lee, and Claude Watkins, also helped to
advance the profession.
The theories of the Palmers receive somewhat
broader interpretation today. Many chiropractors
believe that back pain can be relieved and health
restored through chiropractic treatment even in
patients who do not have demonstrable subluxations.
Scientific development and research of chiropractic is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Chiropractic

gaining momentum. The twenty-first century will
likely see the metaphysical concepts such as innate
intelligence give way to more scientific proofs and
reform.
Many people besides the Palmers have contributed to the development of chiropractic theory and
technique. Some have gone on to create a variety of
procedures and related types of therapy that have their
roots in chiropractic, including McTimoney-Corley
chiropractic, craniosacral manipulation, naprapathy,
and applied kinesiology. Osteopathy is another related
holistic discipline that utilizes spinal and musculoskeletal manipulation as a part of treatment, but osteopathic training is more similar in scope to that of
an M.D.
Initial visit
An initial chiropractic exam will most often include
a history and a physical. The patient should be asked
about the current complaint, whether there are chronic
health problems, family history of disease, dietary
habits, medical care received, and any medications currently being taken. Further, the current complaint
should be described in terms of how long it has been a
problem, how it has progressed, and whether it is the
result of an injury or occurred spontaneously. Details
of how an injury occurred should be given. The physical
exam should evaluate by observation and palpation
whether the painful area has evidence of inflammation
or poor alignment. Range of motion may also be
assessed. In the spine, either hypomobility (fixation)
or hypermobility may be a problem. Laboratory analysis is helpful in some cases to rule out serious infection
or other health issues that may require referral for
another type of treatment. Many practitioners also
insist on x rays during the initial evaluation
Manipulation
When spinal manipulation is employed, it is generally done with the hands, although some practitioners may use an adjusting tool. A classic adjustment
involves a high velocity, low amplitude thrust that produces a usually painless popping noise, and improves
the range of motion of the joint that was treated. The
patient may lie on a specially designed, padded table
that helps the practitioner to achieve the proper positions for treatment. Some adjustments involve manipulating the entire spine, or large portions of it, as a
unit; others are small movements designed to affect a
single joint. Stretching, traction, and slow manipulation
are other techniques that can be employed to restore
structural integrity and relieve nerve interference.

system of adjustment by hand of displacements of the spinal
column and bones. It can also be applied to animals.

A new use of technology with traditional chiropractic care has been introduced. Using a hand-held
device that is pressed to the spine or joints, a chiropractor may soon be able to detect and manipulate the
skeleton not only with his or her hands but with the
computer-linked device that uses harmonic frequencies to detect a misalignment in the spine. The new
technology was not widely accepted in 2004, however.
Length of treatment
The number of chiropractic treatments required will
vary depending on several factors. Generally longerterm treatment is needed for conditions that are chronic,
severe, or occur in conjunction with another health
problem. Patients who are not in overall good health
may also have longer healing times. Some injuries will
849

Chiropractic

inherently require more treatments than others in order
to get relief. Care is given in three stages. Initially
appointments are more frequent with the goal of relieving immediate pain. Next, the patient moves into a
rehabilitative stage to continue the healing process and
help to prevent a relapse. Finally, the patient may elect
periodic maintenance, or wellness treatments, along
with lifestyle changes if needed to stay in good health.
Follow-up care
Discharge and follow-up therapy are important.
If an injury occurred as a result of poor fitness or
health, a program of exercise or nutrition should be
prescribed. Home therapy may also be recommended,
involving such things as anti-inflammatory medication and applications of heat or ice packs. Conscious
attention to posture may help some patients avoid
sustaining a similar injury in the future, and the chiropractor should be able to discern what poor postural
habits require correction. A sedentary lifestyle, particularly with a lot of time spent sitting, is likely to
contribute to poor posture and may predispose a person to back pain and injury.
Types of practitioners
Some practitioners use spinal manipulation to the
exclusion of all other modalities, and are known as
straight chiropractors. Others integrate various types
of therapy such as massage, nutritional intervention,
or treatment with vitamins, herbs, or homeopathic
remedies. They also embrace ideas from other health
care traditions. This group is known as mixers. The
vast majority of chiropractors, perhaps 85%, fall in
this latter category.

Preparations
Patients should enter the chiropractic clinic with
an open mind. This will help to achieve maximum
results.

Precautions
Chiropractic is not an appropriate therapy for diseases that are severely degenerative and may require
medication or surgery. Many conditions of the spine
are amenable to manipulative treatment, but this does
not include fractures. The practitioner should be
informed in advance if the patient is on anticoagulants,
or has osteoporosis or any other condition that may
weaken the bones. Other circumstances might suggest
the patient should not have chiropractic care. These
should be detected in the history or physical exam. In
850

addition to fractures, Down syndrome, some congenital
defects, and some types of cancer are a few of the things
that may preclude spinal manipulation. On rare occasions, a fracture or dislocation may occur. There is also
a very slim possibility of experiencing a stroke as a
result of spinal manipulation, but estimates are that
it is no more frequent than 2.5 occurrences per one
million treatments.
Patients should be wary of chiropractors who
insist on costly x rays and repeated visits with no end
in sight. Extensive use is not scientifically justifiable,
especially in most cases of lower back pain. There are
some circumstances when x rays are indicated, including acute or possibly severe injuries such as those that
might result from a car accident.

Side effects
It is not uncommon to have local discomfort in the
form of aches, pains, or spasms for a few days following a chiropractic treatment. Some patients may also
experience mild headache or fatigue that resolves
quickly.

Research and general acceptance
As recently as the 1970s, the American Medical
Association (a national group of medical doctors) was
quite hostile to chiropractic. AMA members were
advised that it was unethical to be associated with
chiropractors. Fortunately that has changed, and
as of 2000, many allopathic or traditionally trained
physicians enjoy cordial referral relationships with
chiropractors. The public is strongly in favor of chiropractic treatment. Chiropractors see the lion’s share of
all patients who seek medical help for back problems.
And chiropractic treatment is the most widely used of
all alternative medical treatments.
Research has also supported the use of spinal
manipulation for acute low back pain. There is some
anecdotal evidence recommending chiropractic treatment for ailments unrelated to musculoskeletal problems, but there is not enough research-based data to
support this. On the other hand, a chiropractor may be
able to treat problems and diseases unrelated to the
skeletal structure by employing therapies other than
spinal manipulation.
Although many chiropractors limit their practice
to spine and joint problems, others claim to treat disorders that are not closely related to the back or
musculoskeletal system. These include asthma, bedwetting, bronchitis, coughs, dizziness, dysmenorrhea,
earache, fainting, headache, hyperactivity, indigestion,

infertility, migraine, pneumonia, and issues related to
pregnancy. There are at least three explanations for the
possible effectiveness for these conditions. One is that
the problem could be linked to a nerve impingement,
as may be possible with bed-wetting, dizziness, fainting, and headache. In a second group, chiropractic
treatment may offer some relief from complicating
pain and spasms caused by the disease process, as
with asthma, bronchitis, coughs, and pneumonia.
The discomforts of pregnancy may also be relieved
with gentle chiropractic therapy. A third possibility is
that manipulation or use of soft-tissue techniques may
directly promote improvement of some conditions.
One particular procedure, known as the endonasal
technique, is thought to help the eustachian tube to
open and thus improve drainage of the middle ear. The
tube is sometimes blocked off due to exudates or
inflammatory processes. This can offer significant
relief from earaches. Some headaches also fall in this
category, as skilled use of soft tissue techniques and
adjustment may relieve the muscle tension that may
initiate some headaches.
Dysmenorrhea, hyperactivity, indigestion, and
infertility are said to be relieved as a result of improved
flow of blood and nerve energy following treatment.
Evidence for this is anecdotal at best, but manipulation is unlikely to be harmful if causes treatable by
other modalities have been ruled out.
For conditions such as cancer, fractures, infectious diseases, neurologic disease processes, and anything that may cause increased orthopedic fragility,
chiropractic treatment alone is not an effective therapy, and may even be harmful in some cases. Those
who have known circulatory problems, especially
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

with a history of thrombosis, should not have spinal
manipulation.

I Chlamydial pneumonia
Definition
Chlamydial pneumonia refers to one of several
types of pneumonia that can be caused by various
types of the bacteria known as Chlamydia.

Description
Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs. The air
sacs (alveoli) and/or the tissues of the lungs become
swollen, and the alveoli may fill with pus or fluid. This
prevents the lungs from taking in sufficient oxygen,
which deprives the blood and the rest of the body’s
tissues of oxygen.
There are three major types of Chlamydia:
Chlamydia psittaci, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and
Chlamydia trachomatis. Each of these has the potential
to cause a type of pneumonia.

Causes and symptoms
Chlamydia trachomatis is a major cause of sexually transmitted diseases (called nongonococcal urethritis and pelvic inflammatory disease). When a woman
with an active chlamydial infection gives birth to a
baby, the baby may aspirate (suck into his or her

lungs) some of the mother’s bacteria-laden secretions
while passing through the birth canal. This can cause a
form of relatively mild pneumonia in the newborn,
occurring about two to six weeks after delivery.
Chlamydia psittaci is a bacteria carried by many
types of birds, including pigeons, canaries, parakeets,
parrots, and some gulls. Humans acquire the bacteria
through contact with dust from bird feathers, bird
droppings, or from the bite of a bird carrying the
bacteria. People who keep birds as pets or who work
where birds are kept have the highest risk for this type
of pneumonia. This pneumonia, called psittacosis,
causes fever, cough, and the production of sputum
containing pus. This type of pneumonia may be quite
severe, and is usually more serious in older patients.
The illness can last several weeks.
Chlamydia pneumoniae usually causes a type of
relatively mild ‘‘walking pneumonia.’’ Patients experience fever and cough. This type of pneumonia is called a
‘‘community-acquired pneumonia’’ because it is easily
passed from one member of the community to another.

Diagnosis
Laboratory tests indicating the presence of one of
the strains of Chlamydia are sophisticated, expensive, and
performed in only a few laboratories across the country.
For this reason, doctors diagnose most cases of chlamydial pneumonia by performing a physical examination of
the patient, and noting the presence of certain factors.
For instance, if the mother of a baby sick with pneumonia
is positive for a sexually transmitted disease caused by
Chlamydia trachomatis, the diagnosis is obvious. History
of exposure to birds in a patient sick with pneumonia
suggests that Chlamydia psittaci may be the culprit. A
mild pneumonia in an otherwise healthy person is likely
to be a community-acquired walking pneumonia, such
as that caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae.

KEY TERMS
Alveoli—The small air sacs clustered at the ends
of the bronchioles in the lungs, in which oxygencarbon dioxide exchange takes place.
Aspiration—When solids or liquids that should be
swallowed into the stomach are instead breathed
into the respiratory system, or when substances
from the outside environment are accidentally
breathed into the lungs.
Sputum—Material produced within the alveoli in
response to an infectious or inflammatory process.

Treatment
Treatment varies depending on the specific type of
Chlamydia causing the infection. A newborn with
Chlamydia trachomatis improves rapidly with erythromycin. Chlamydia psittaci infection is treated with
tetracycline, bed rest, oxygen supplementation, and
codeine-containing cough preparations. Chlamydia
pneumoniae infection is treated with erythromycin.

Prognosis
The prognosis is generally excellent for the newborn
with Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia. Chlamydia
852

psittaci may linger, and severe cases have a death rate
of as high as 30%. The elderly are hardest hit by this
type of pneumonia. A young, healthy person with
Chlamydia pneumoniae has an excellent prognosis. In
the elderly, however, there is a 5–10% death rate from
this infection.

Prevention
Prevention of Chlamydia trachomatis pneumonia
involves recognizing the symptoms of genital infection

inhale them. About 3,000 adults die each year from
choking on food.

Chlamydia psittaci can be prevented by warning
people who have birds as pets, or who work around
birds, to be careful to avoid contact with the dust and
droppings of these birds. Sick birds can be treated with
an antibiotic in their feed. Because people can contract
psittacosis from each other, a person sick with this
infection should be kept in isolation, so as not to infect
other people.

People also choke because infection causes the
throat tissue to swell shut. It is believed that this is
what caused George Washington’s death. Allergic
reactions can also cause the throat to swell shut.
Acute allergic reactions are called anaphylactic reactions and may be fatal. Strangulation puts external
pressure on the trachea causing another form of
choking.

Chlamydia pneumoniae is difficult to prevent
because it is spread by respiratory droplets from
other sick people. Because people with this type of
pneumonia do not always feel very sick, they often
continue to attend school, go to work, and go to
other public places. They then spread the bacteria in
the tiny droplets that are released into the air during
coughing. Therefore, this pneumonia is very difficult
to prevent and often occurs in outbreaks within
communities.

Finally, people can choke from obstructive sleep
apnea. This is a condition where tissues of the body
obstruct the airways during sleep. Sleep apnea is most
common in obese men who sleep on their backs.
Smoking, heavy alcohol use, lung diseases such as
emphysema, and an inherited tendency toward a narrowed airway and throat all increase the risk of choking during sleep.

Choking

Definition
Choking is the inability to breathe because the
trachea is blocked, constricted, or swollen shut.

Description
Choking is a medical emergency. When a person is
choking, air cannot reach the lungs. If the airways
cannot be cleared, death follows rapidly.
Anyone can choke, but choking is more common
in children than in adults. Choking is a common cause
of accidental death in young children who are apt to
put toys or coins in their mouths, then unintentionally
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis
Diagnosing choking due to mechanical obstruction is straightforward, since the symptoms are
obvious even to an untrained person. In choking due
to infection, the person, usually a child, will have a
fever and signs of illness before labored breathing
begins. If choking is due to an allergic reaction to
medication or insect bites, the person’s earlobes and
face will swell, giving an external sign that internal
swelling is also occurring.

Choking due to sleep apnea is usually diagnosed
on reports of symptoms by the person’s sleep partner.
There are also alarm devices to detect the occurrence
of sleep apnea. Eventually sleep may be interrupted so
frequently that daytime drowsiness becomes a
problem.

Treatment
Choking, except during sleep apnea, is a medical
emergency. If choking is due to allergic reaction or
infection, people should summon emergency help or
go immediately to an emergency room. If choking is
due to obstructed airways, the Heimlich maneuver (an
emergency procedure in which a person is grasped from
behind in order to forcefully expel the obstruction)
should be performed immediately. In severe cases a
tracheotomy (an incision into the trachea through the
neck below the larynx) must be performed.
Patients who suffer airway obstruction during
sleep can be treated with a device similar to an oxygen
mask that creates positive airway pressure and delivers
a mixture of oxygen and air.

Prognosis
Many people are treated successfully for choking
with no permanent effects. However, if treatment is
unsuccessful, the person dies from lack of oxygen. In
cases where the airway is restored after the critical
period passes, there may be permanent brain damage.

Prevention
Watching children carefully to keep them from
putting foreign objects in their mouth and avoiding
giving young children food like raisins, round slices
of hot dogs, and grapes can reduce the chance of
choking in children. Adults should avoid heavy alcohol consumption when eating and avoid talking and
laughing with food in their mouths. The risk of
obstructive sleep apnea choking can be reduced by

I Cholangitis
Definition
The term cholangitis means inflammation of the
bile ducts. The term applies to inflammation of any
portion of the bile ducts, which carry bile from the
liver to the gallbladder and intestine. The inflammation is produced by bacterial infection or sometimes
other causes.

Description
Bile, which is needed for digestion, is produced in
the liver and then enters the common bile duct (CBD)
through the hepatic ducts. Bile enters the gallbladder
between meals, when the muscle or sphincter that
controls flow of bile between the CBD and intestine
is closed. During this period, bile accumulates in the
CBD; the pressure in the CBD rises, as would a pipe
closed off at one end. The increase in pressure eventually causes the bile to flow into the gallbladder.
During meals, the gallbladder contracts and the
sphincter between the gallbladder and intestine
relaxes, permitting bile to flow into the intestine and
take part in digestion.
Bile that has just been produced by the liver is
sterile (free of bacteria). This is partly due to its antibacterial properties; these are produced by the immunoglobulins (antibodies) secreted in bile, the bile acids
which inhibit bacterial growth themselves, and mucus.
A small number of bacteria may be present in the
bile ducts and gallbladder, getting there by moving
backward from the intestine, which unlike the bile
ducts, contains large numbers of bacteria. The normal
flow of bile out of the ducts and into the intestine also
helps keep too many organisms from multiplying.
Bacteria also reach the bile ducts from the lymph
tissue or from the blood stream.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Another source of inflammation of the bile ducts
occurs in diseases of altered immunity, known as
‘‘autoimmune diseases.’’ In these diseases, the body
fails to recognize certain cells as part of its normal
composition. The body thinks these cells are foreign
and produces antibodies to fight them off, just as it
fights against bacteria and viruses. Primary sclerosing
cholangitis is a typical example of an autoimmune
disease involving the bile ducts.

Causes and symptoms
As noted above, the two things that are needed for
cholangitis to occur are: 1) obstruction to bile flow,
and 2) presence of bacteria within the bile ducts. The
most common cause of cholangitis is infection of the
bile ducts due to blockage by a gallstone. Strictures
(portions of ducts that have become narrow) also
function in the same way. Strictures may be due to
congenital (birth) abnormalities of the bile ducts, form
as a result of injury to the bile duct (such as surgery,
trauma), or result from inflammation that leads to
scar tissue and narrowing.
The bacterium most commonly associated with
infection of the bile ducts is Escherichia coli (E. coli)
which is a normal inhabitant of the intestine. In
some cases, more than one type of bacteria is involved.
Patients with AIDS can develop infection of narrowed bile ducts with unusual organisms such as
Cryptosporidium and others.
The three symptoms present in about 70% of
patients with cholangitis are abdominal pain, fever,
and jaundice. Some patients only have chills and
fever with minimal abdominal symptoms. Jaundice
or yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes occurs in
about 80% of patients. The color change is due to bile
pigments that accumulate in the blood and eventually
in the skin and eyes.
Inflammation due to the autoimmune disease primary sclerosing cholangitis leads to multiple areas of
narrowing and eventual infection. Tumors can block
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

the bile duct and also cause cholangitis, but as noted,
infection is relatively infrequent; in fact cholangitis
occurs in only about one in six patients with tumors.
Another type of bile duct infection occurs mainly
in Southeast Asia and is known as recurrent pyogenic
cholangitis or Oriental cholangitis. It has also been
identified in Asians immigrating to North America.
Most patients have stones in the bile ducts and/or
gallbladder, and many cases are associated with the
presence of parasites within the ducts. The role of
parasites in causing infection is not clear. Many
researchers believe that they are just coincidental,
and have nothing to do with the stones or infection.

Diagnosis
The above symptoms alone are very suggestive of
cholangitis; however, it is important to determine the
exact cause and site of possible obstruction. This is
because attacks are likely to recur, and different causes
require different treatments. For example, the treatment of cholangitis due to a stone in the CBD is
different from that due to bile duct strictures. An
elevated white blood count suggests infection, but
may be normal in 20% of patients. Abnormal or elevated tests of liver function, such as bilirubin and
others are also frequently present. The specific
bacteria is sometimes identified from blood cultures.
X-ray techniques
A number of x-ray techniques can make the diagnosis of bile duct obstruction; these include ultrasound
and computed tomography scans (CT scans). However,
ultrasound often cannot tell if an obstruction is due to
a stricture or stone, missing a stone in about half the
cases. CT scans have an even poorer record of stone
detection.
Another method of diagnosing and sometimes
treating the cause of bile duct obstruction or narrowing is called percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. In this procedure, dye is injected into the ducts
by means of a needle placed into the liver. It is also
used to drain bile and relieve an obstruction.
ENDOSCOPIC TECHNIQUES. An endoscope is a thin
flexible tube that uses a lens or mirror to look at
various parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can
accurately determine the cause and site of blockage.
It also has the advantage of being able to treat the
cause of obstruction, by removing stones and dilating
(stretching) strictures. ERCP involves the injection of
x-ray dye into the bile ducts through an endoscope.

855

Cholangitis

When the passage of bile out of the ducts is
blocked, the few bacteria that are there rapidly reproduce. A partial blockage to the flow of bile can occur
when a stone from the gallbladder blocks the duct, and
also allows bacteria to flow back into the CBD, and
creates ideal conditions for their growth. Tumors, on
the other hand, cause a more complete blockage of bile
flow, both in and out, so fewer infections occur. The
reproducing organisms are often able to enter the
bloodstream and infect multiple organs such as
the liver and heart valves.

Cholangitis

Endoscopic ultrasound is another endoscopic alternative, but is not as available as ERCP and is not
therapeutic.

Treatment
The first aim is to control the bacterial infection.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics are usually used. If the
infection does not come under control promptly, as
noted by decrease in fever and pain, then other methods to relieve the obstruction and infection will be
needed. Either way, definitive treatment of the cause
of bile duct infection is the next step, and this has
undergone revolutionary changes in the past decade.
Endoscopic, radiographic and other techniques have
made it possible to successfully remove stones and
dilate strictures that previously required surgical intervention, often with high morbidity and mortality.
Radiologic and endoscopic techniques
Just as with diagnosis, treatment of cholangitis
involves a number of similar procedures that differ
mainly in the way the bile ducts are entered. The
aims of these techniques are immediate relief of
obstruction and infection as well as correction of any
abnormalities that have caused them. It is important
to realize that even with endoscopy, x-ray dye is
injected into the ducts and therefore the radiologist
plays a role in both types of procedures. When endoscopy is used, the muscle between the intestine and bile
duct is widened, to allow stones to pass. This is called a
sphincterotomy and is often enough to relieve any
obstruction and help clear infection. The widening of
the muscle is needed if other procedures involving the
bile duct are going to be performed.
The above techniques can be summarized as
follows:


Insertion of a catheter or thin flexible tube to drain
bile and relieve obstruction. When performed by
insertion of a needle into the liver the technique is
called percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
(PTBD); when performed endoscopically the catheter exits through the nose and is called a nasobiliary
drain.



Balloons can be inserted into the ducts with either
method to dilate strictures.



Insertion of a prosthesis which is a rigid or flexible
tube designed to keep a narrowed area open; it is
usually placed after a stricture is dilated with a
balloon.



Removal of stones can be accomplished most often
by endoscopic techniques. A number of methods

856

have been developed to perform this including laser
and contact lithotripsy in which stones are fragmented by high-energy waves.
Surgical treatment
Fortunately, with recent advances in the above
methods, this is a last option. Nonetheless, about
5–10% of patients will need to undergo surgical
exploration of the bile ducts.
In some instances, the bile duct is so narrowed due
to prior inflammation or tumor, that it needs connection to a different area of the intestinal tract to drain.
This is rather complicated surgery and carries a mortality rate of 2%.
Other treatment
Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL)
was first used to break up kidney stones. The technique
has been extended to the treatment of gallstones, in
both the gallbladder and bile ducts. It is often combined with endoscopic procedures to ease the passage
of fragmented stones, or oral medications that can
dissolve the fragments. Rarely, stones are also dissolved by instilling various chemicals such as ether
directly into the bile ducts.

Prognosis
The outlook for those with cholangitis has markedly improved in the last several years due in large part
to the development of the techniques described above.
For those patients whose episode of infection is caused
by something other than a simple stone, the future is
not as bright, but still often responsive to treatment.
Some patients with autoimmune disease will need liver
transplantation.

Prevention
This involves eliminating those factors that
increase the risk of infection of the bile ducts, mainly
stones and strictures. If it is medically possible,
patients who have their gallbladder and suffer a bout
of cholangitis should undergo surgical removal of the
gallbladder and removal of any stones.
For other patients, a variety of therapies as outlined above, including dissolving small stones with bile
acids are also available. A combination of several of
these methods is needed in some patients. Patients
should discuss the risks and alternatives of these treatments with their physicians.

Bilirubin—A pigment produced by the liver that is
excreted in bile which causes a yellow discoloration
of the skin and eyes when it accumulates in those
organs. Bilirubin levels can be measured by blood
tests, and are most often elevated in patients with
liver disease or a blockage to bile flow.
Computed tomography scan (CT scan)—A specialized x-ray procedure in which cross-sections of the
area in question can be examined in detail. In evaluating the bile ducts, iodine-based dye is often
injected intravenously. The procedure is of greatest
value in diagnosing the complications of gallstones
(such as abscesses, pancreatitis) rather than documenting the presence of a stone.
Endoscope—An endoscope as used in the field of
gastroenterology is a thin flexible tube which uses a
lens or miniature camera to view various areas of the
gastrointestinal tract. When the procedure is performed to examine certain organs such as the bile
ducts or pancreas, the organs are not viewed
directly, but rather indirectly through the injection
of x-ray dye into the bile duct.
Endoscopy—The performance of an exam using an
endoscope is referred by the general term endoscopy.
Diagnosis through biopsies or other means and therapeutic procedures can be done with these instruments.

Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL)—
This is a technique that uses high-pressure waves
similar to sound waves that can be ‘‘focused’’ on a
very small area, thereby fracturing small solid objects
such as gallstones, kidney stones, etc. The small fragments can pass more easily and harmlessly into the
intestine or can be dissolved with medications.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis—A chronic disease
in which it is believed that the immune system fails
to recognize the cells that compose the bile ducts as
part of the same body, and attempts to destroy them.
It is not clear what exactly causes the disease, but it is
frequently associated with another inflammatory
disease of the digestive tract, ulcerative colitis. The
inflammation of the ducts eventually produces formation of scar tissue, causing multiple areas of narrowing (strictures) that block bile flow and lead to
bacterial infection. Liver transplant gives the best
chance for long-term survival.
Ultrasound—A non-invasive procedure based on
changes in sound waves of a frequency that cannot
be heard, but respond to changes in tissue composition. It requires no preparation and no radiation
occurs. It has become the ‘‘gold standard’’ for diagnosis of stones in the gallbladder, but is less accurate
in diagnosing stones in the bile ducts. Gallstones as
small as 2 mm can be identified. The procedure can
now also be done through an endoscope, greatly
improving investigation of the bile ducts.

I Cholecystectomy
Definition
A cholecystectomy is the surgical removal of the
gallbladder. The two basic types of this procedure are
open cholecystectomy and the laparoscopic approach.
It is estimated that the laparoscopic procedure is currently used for approximately 80% of cases.

Purpose
A cholecystectomy is performed to treat cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. In cholelithiasis, gallstones
of varying shapes and sizes form from the solid components of bile. The presence of stones, often referred
to as gallbladder disease, may produce symptoms of
excruciating right upper abdominal pain radiating to
the right shoulder. The gallbladder may become the

site of acute infection and inflammation, resulting in
symptoms of upper right abdominal pain, nausea and
vomiting. This condition is referred to as cholecystitis. The surgical removal of the gallbladder can
provide relief of these symptoms.

Precautions
Although the laparoscopic procedure requires
general anesthesia for about the same length of time
as the open procedure, laparoscopy generally produces
less postoperative pain, and a shorter recovery period.
The laparoscopic procedure would not be preferred in
cases where the gallbladder is so inflamed that it could
rupture, or when adhesions (additional fibrous bands
of tissue) are present.

Description
The laparoscopic cholecystectomy involves the
insertion of a long narrow cylindrical tube with a
camera on the end, through an approximately 1 cm
incision in the abdomen, which allows visualization of
the internal organs and projection of this image onto a
video monitor. Three smaller incisions allow for insertion of other instruments to perform the surgical procedure. A laser may be used for the incision and
cautery (burning unwanted tissue to stop bleeding),
in which case the procedure may be called laser laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
In a conventional or open cholecystectomy, the
gallbladder is removed through a surgical incision
high in the right abdomen, just beneath the ribs.
A drain may be inserted to prevent accumulation of
fluid at the surgical site.
858

Cholecystitis—Infection and inflammation of the
gallbladder, causing severe pain and rigidity in the
upper right abdomen.
Cholelithiasis—Also known as gallstones, these
hard masses are formed in the gallbladder or passages, and can cause severe upper right abdominal
pain radiating to the right shoulder, as a result of
blocked bile flow.
Gallbladder—A hollow pear-shaped sac on the
under surface of the right lobe of the liver. Bile
comes to it from the liver, and passes from it to
the intestine to aid in digestion.

Preparation
As with any surgical procedure, the patient will be
required to sign a consent form after the procedure is
explained thoroughly. Food and fluids will be prohibited after midnight before the procedure. Enemas may
be ordered to clean out the bowel. If nausea or vomiting
are present, a suction tube to empty the stomach may be
used, and for laparoscopic procedures, a urinary drainage catheter will also be used to decrease the risk of
accidental puncture of the stomach or bladder with
insertion of the trocar (a sharp-pointed instrument).

Aftercare
Post-operative care for the patient who has had an
open cholecystectomy, as with those who have had
any major surgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure, pulse, respiration and temperature. Breathing
tends to be shallow because of the effect of anesthesia,
and the patient’s reluctance to breathe deeply due to
the pain caused by the proximity of the incision to the
muscles used for respiration. The patient is shown how
to support the operative site when breathing deeply
and coughing, and given pain medication as necessary.
Fluid intake and output is measured, and the operative site is observed for color and amount of wound
drainage. Fluids are given intravenously for 24–48
hours, until the patient’s diet is gradually advanced
as bowel activity resumes. The patient is generally
encouraged to walk 8 hours after surgery and discharged from the hospital within three to five days,
with return to work approximately four to six weeks
after the procedure.
Care received immediately after laparoscopic
cholecystectomy is similar to that of any patient
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Risks
Potential problems associated with open cholecystectomy include respiratory problems related to location of the incision, wound infection, or abscess
formation. Possible complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy include accidental puncture of the bowel
or bladder and uncontrolled bleeding. Incomplete reabsorption of the carbon dioxide gas could irritate the
muscles used in respiration and cause respiratory
distress.

I Cholecystitis
Definition
Cholecystitis refers to a painful inflammation of
the gallbladder’s wall. The disorder can occur a single
time (acute), or can recur multiple times (chronic).

Description
The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ in
the upper right hand corner of the abdomen. It is
connected by a series of ducts (tube-like channels) to
the liver, pancreas, and duodenum (first part of the
small intestine). To aid in digestion, the liver produces
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

a substance called bile, which is passed into the gallbladder. The gallbladder concentrates this bile, meaning that it reabsorbs some of the fluid from the bile to
make it more potent. After a meal, bile is squeezed out
of the gallbladder by strong muscular contractions,
and passes through a duct into the duodenum. Due
to the chemical makeup of bile, the contents of the
duodenum are kept at an optimal pH level for digestion. The bile also plays an important part in allowing
fats within the small intestine to be absorbed.

Causes and symptoms
In about 95% of all cases of cholecystitis, the
gallbladder contains gallstones. Gallstones are solid
accumulations of the components of bile, particularly
cholesterol, bile pigments, and calcium. These solids
may occur when the components of bile are not in the
correct proportion to each other. If the bile becomes
overly concentrated, or if too much of one component
is present, stones may form. When these stones block
the duct leaving the gallbladder, bile accumulates
within the gallbladder. The gallbladder continues to
contract, but the bile cannot pass out of the gallbladder in the normal way. Back pressure on the gallbladder, chemical changes from the stagnating bile trapped
within the gallbladder, and occasionally bacterial
infection, result in damage to the gallbladder wall.
As the gallbladder becomes swollen, some areas of
the wall do not receive adequate blood flow, and lack
of oxygen causes cells to die.
When the stone blocks the flow of bile from the
liver, certain normal byproducts of the liver’s processing of red blood cells (called bilirubin) build up. The
bilirubin is reabsorbed into the bloodstream, and over
time this bilirubin is deposited in the skin and in the
whites of the eyes. Because bilirubin contains a yellowish color, it causes a yellowish cast to the skin and eyes
that is called jaundice.
Gallstone formation is seen in twice as many
women as men, particularly those between the ages of
20 and 60. Pregnant women, or those on birth control
pills or estrogen replacement therapy have a greater risk
of gallstones, as do Native Americans and Mexican
Americans. People who are overweight, or who lose a
large amount of weight quickly are also at greater risk
for developing gallstones. Not all individuals with gallstones will go on to have cholecystitis, since many
people never have any symptoms from their gallstones
and never know they exist. However, the vast majority
of people with cholecystitis will be found to have gallstones. Rare causes of cholecystitis include severe burns
or injury, massive systemic infection, severe illness,

undergoing surgery with general anesthesia. A unique
post-operative pain may be experienced in the right
shoulder related to pressure from carbon dioxide used
through the laparoscopic tubes. This pain may be
relieved by laying on the left side with right knee and
thigh drawn up to the chest. Walking will also help
increase the body’s reabsorption of the gas. The patient
is usually discharged the day after surgery, and allowed
to shower on the second postoperative day. The patient
is advised to gradually resume normal activities over a
three day period, while avoiding heavy lifting for about
10 days.

Although there are rare reports of patients with
chronic cholecystitis who never experience any pain,
nearly 100% of the time cholecystitis will be diagnosed
after a patient has experienced a bout of severe pain in
the region of the gallbladder and liver. The pain may
be crampy and episodic, or it may be constant. The
pain is often described as pushing through to the right
upper back and shoulder. Because deep breathing
increases the pain, breathing becomes shallow. Fever
is often present, and nausea and vomiting are nearly
universal. Jaundice occurs when the duct leaving the
liver is also obstructed, although it may take a number
of days for it to become apparent. When bacterial
infection sets in, the patient may begin to experience
higher fever and shaking chills.

in stretching of the gallbladder and disruption of its
wall by gas.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of cholecystitis involves a careful
abdominal examination. The enlarged, tender gallbladder may be felt through the abdominal wall.
Pressure in the upper right corner of the abdomen
may cause the patient to stop breathing in, due to an
increase in pain. This is called Murphy’s sign. Physical
examination may also reveal an increased heart rate
and an increased rate of breathing.
Blood tests will show an increase in the white
blood count, as well as an increase in bilirubin.
Ultrasound is used to look for gallstones and to measure the thickness of the gallbladder wall (a marker of
inflammation and scarring). A scan of the liver and
gallbladder, with careful attention to the system of
ducts throughout (called the biliary tree) is also used
to demonstrate obstruction of ducts.
Rare complications of cholecystitis include:


massive infection of the gallbladder, in which the
gallbladder becomes filled with pus (called empyema)



perforation of the gallbladder, in which the build-up
of material within the gallbladder becomes so great
that the wall of the organ bursts, with a resulting
abdominal infection called peritonitis



formation of abnormal connections between the gallbladder and other organs (the duodenum, large intestine, stomach), called fistulas



obstruction of the intestine by a very large gallstone
(called gallstone ileus)



emphysema of the gallbladder, in which certain bacteria that produce gas infect the gallbladder, resulting

Treatment
Initial treatment of cholecystitis usually requires
hospitalization. The patient is given fluids, salts, and
sugars through a needle placed in a vein (intravenous
or IV). No food or drink is given by mouth, and often
a tube, called a nasogastric or NG tube, will need to be
passed through the nose and down into the stomach to
drain out the excess fluids. If infection is suspected,
antibiotics are given.
Ultimately, treatment almost always involves
removal of the gallbladder, a surgery called cholecystectomy. While this is not usually recommended while
the patient is acutely ill, patients with complications
usually do require emergency surgery (immediately
following diagnosis) because the death rate increases
in these cases. Similarly, those patients who have cholecystitis with no gallstones have about a 50% chance
of death if the gallbladder is not quickly removed.
Most patients, however, do best if surgery is performed after they have been stabilized with fluids, an
NG tube, and antibiotics as necessary. When this is
possible, gallbladder removal is done within five to six
days of diagnosis. In patients who have other serious
medical problems that may increase the risks of gallbladder removal surgery, the surgeon may decide to
leave the gallbladder in place. In this case, the operation may involve removing obstructing gallstones and
draining infected bile (called cholecystotomy).
Both cholecystectomy and cholecystotomy may
be performed via the classical open abdominal operation (laparotomy). Tiny, ‘‘keyhole’’ incisions, a flexible scope, and a laser device that shatters the stones

contents at the appropriate pH for digestion, and to
help break down fats.

Definition

(a laparoscopic laser) can be used to destroy the gallstones. The laparoscopic procedure can also be used to
remove the gallbladder through one of the small incisions. Because of the smaller incisions, laparoscopic
cholecystectomy is a procedure that is less painful and
promotes faster healing.

Prognosis
Hospital management of cholecystitis ends the
symptoms for about 75% of all patients. Of these
patients, however, 25% will go on to have another
attack of cholecystitis within a year, and 60% will
have another attack within six years. Each attack of
cholecystitis increases a patient’s risk of developing
life-threatening complications, requiring risky emergency surgery. Therefore, early removal of the gallbladder, rather than a ‘‘wait-and-see’’ approach, is
usually recommended. Cure is complete in those
patients who undergo cholecystectomy.

Prevention
Prevention of cholecystitis is probably best
attempted by maintaining a reasonably ideal weight.
Some studies have suggested that eating a diet high in
fiber, vegetables, and fruit is also protective.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Cholera is an acute infectious disease characterized by watery diarrhea that is caused by the bacterium
Vibrio cholerae, first identified by Robert Koch in
1883 during a cholera outbreak in Egypt. The name
of the disease comes from a Greek word meaning
‘‘flow of bile.’’
Cholera is spread by eating food or drinking
water contaminated with the bacterium. Although
cholera was a public health problem in the United
States and Europe a hundred years ago, modern
sanitation and the treatment of drinking water have
virtually eliminated the disease in developed countries. Cholera outbreaks, however, still occur from
time to time in less developed countries, particularly
following such natural disasters as the tsunami that
struck countries surrounding the Indian Ocean in
December 2004. In these areas cholera is still the
most feared epidemic diarrheal disease because people
can die within hours of infection from dehydration
due to the loss of water from the body through the
bowels.
V. cholerae is a gram-negative aerobic bacillus, or
rod-shaped bacterium. It has two major biotypes:
classic and El Tor. El Tor is the biotype responsible
for most of the cholera outbreaks reported from 1961
through the early 2000s.

KEY TERMS

Cholera

Description
Cholera is spread by eating food or drinking water
that has been contaminated with cholera bacteria.
Contamination usually occurs when human feces
from a person who has the disease seeps into a community water supply. Fruits and vegetables can also be
contaminated in areas where crops are fertilized with
human feces. Cholera bacteria also live in warm, brackish water and can infect persons who eat raw or undercooked seafood obtained from such waters. Cholera is
rarely transmitted directly from one person to another.
Cholera often occurs in outbreaks or epidemics;
seven pandemics (countrywide or worldwide epidemics)
of cholera have been recorded between 1817 and 2003.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that
during any cholera epidemic, approximately 0.2–1% of
the local population will contract the disease. Anyone
can get cholera, but infants, children, and the elderly are
more likely to die from the disease because they become
dehydrated faster than adults. There is no particular
season in which cholera is more likely to occur.
Because of an extensive system of sewage and water
treatment in the United States, Canada, Europe, Japan,
and Australia, cholera is generally not a concern for
visitors and residents of these countries. Between 1995
and 2000, 61 cases of cholera in American citizens were
reported to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC); only 24 represented infections
acquired in the United States. People visiting or living
in other parts of the world, particularly on the Indian
subcontinent and in parts of Africa and South America,
should be aware of the potential for contracting cholera
and practice prevention. Fortunately, the disease is
both preventable and treatable.

Causes and symptoms
Because V. cholerae is sensitive to acid, most choleracausing bacteria die in the acidic environment of the
stomach. However, when a person has ingested food or
water containing large amounts of cholera bacteria, some
will survive to infect the intestines. As would be
expected, antacid usage or the use of any medication
that blocks acid production in the stomach would allow
more bacteria to survive and cause infection.
In the small intestine, the rapidly multiplying
bacteria produce a toxin that causes a large volume of
water and electrolytes to be secreted into the bowels and
then to be abruptly eliminated in the form of watery
diarrhea. Vomiting may also occur. Symptoms begin to
appear between one and three days after the contaminated food or water has been ingested.

Most cases of cholera are mild, but about one in 20
patients experience severe, potentially life-threatening
symptoms. In severe cases, fluids can be lost through
diarrhea and vomiting at the rate of one quart per hour.
This can produce a dangerous state of dehydration
unless the lost fluids and electrolytes are rapidly
replaced.
Signs of dehydration include intense thirst, little
or no urine output, dry skin and mouth, an absence of
tears, glassy or sunken eyes, muscle cramps, weakness,
and rapid heart rate. The fontanelle (soft spot on an
infant’s head) will appear to be sunken or drawn in.
Dehydration occurs most rapidly in the very young
and the very old because they have fewer fluid
reserves. A doctor should be consulted immediately
any time signs of severe dehydration occur. Immediate
replacement of the lost fluids and electrolytes is necessary to prevent kidney failure, coma, and death.
Some people are at greater risk of having a severe
case of cholera if they become infected:


People taking proton pump inhibitors, histamine
blockers, or antacids to control acid indigestion. As
noted earlier, V. cholerae is sensitive to stomach acid.



People who have had chronic gastritis caused by
infection with Helicobacter pylori.



People who have had a partial gastrectomy (surgical
removal of a portion of the stomach).

Diagnosis
Rapid diagnosis of cholera can be made by examining a fresh stool sample under the microscope for the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

their feces for up to two weeks. Chronic carriers of
the disease are rare. With prompt fluid and electrolyte replacement, the death rate in patients with
severe cholera is less than 1%. Untreated, the death
rate can be greater than 50%. The difficulty in treating severe cholera does not lie in not knowing how to
treat it but rather in getting medical care to the sick in
underdeveloped areas of the world where medical
resources are limited.

Treatment
The key to treating cholera lies in preventing dehydration by replacing the fluids and electrolytes lost
through diarrhea and vomiting. The discovery that
rehydration can be accomplished orally revolutionized
the treatment of cholera and other, similar diseases by
making this simple, cost-effective treatment widely
available throughout the world. The World Health
Organization has developed an inexpensive oral replacement fluid containing appropriate amounts of water,
sugar, and salts that is used worldwide. In cases of severe
dehydration, replacement fluids must be given intravenously. Patients should be encouraged to drink when
they can keep liquids down and eat when their appetite
returns. Recovery generally takes three to six days.
Adults may be given the antibiotic tetracycline to
shorten the duration of the illness and reduce fluid loss.
The World Health Organization recommends this antibiotic treatment only in cases of severe dehydration. If
antibiotics are overused, the cholera bacteria organism
may become resistant to the drug, making the antibiotic
ineffective in treating even severe cases of cholera.
Tetracycline is not given to children whose permanent
teeth have not come in because it can cause the teeth to
become permanently discolored.
Other antibiotics that may be given to speed up
the clearance of V. cholerae from the body include
ciprofloxacin and erythromycin.
A possible complementary or alternative treatment for fluid loss caused by cholera is a plant-derived
compound, an extract made from the tree bark of
Croton lechleri, the Sangre de grado tree found in the
South American rain forest. Researchers at a hospital
research institute in California report that the extract
appears to work by preventing the loss of chloride and
other electrolytes from the body.

Prognosis
Today, cholera is a very treatable disease.
Patients with milder cases of cholera usually recover
on their own in three to six days without additional
complications. They may eliminate the bacteria in
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Prevention
The best form of cholera prevention is to establish
good sanitation and waste treatment systems. In the
absence of adequate sewage treatment, the following
guidelines should be followed to reduce the possibility
of infection:


Boil it. Drink and brush teeth only with water that
has been boiled or treated with chlorine or iodine
tablets. Safe drinks include coffee and tea made
with boiling water or carbonated bottled water and
carbonated soft drinks.



Cook it. Eat only thoroughly cooked foods, and eat
them while they are still hot. Avoid eating food from
street vendors.



Peel it. Eat only fruit or nuts with a thick intact skin
or shell that is removed immediately before eating.



Forget it. Do not eat raw foods such as oysters or
ceviche. Avoid salads and raw vegetables. Do not use
untreated ice cubes in otherwise safe drinks.



Stay out of it. Do not swim or fish in polluted water.

Preventive measures following natural disasters
include guaranteeing the purity of community drinking water, either by large-scale chlorination and boiling, or by bringing in bottled or purified water from
the outside. Other important preventive measures at
the community level include provision for the safe
disposal of human feces and good food hygiene.
Because cholera is one of the few infectious diseases that can be spread by human remains (through
fecal matter leaking from corpses into the water supply), emergency workers who handle human remains
are at increased risk of infection. It is considered preferable to bury corpses rather than to cremate them,
however, and to allow survivors time to conduct
appropriate burial ceremonies or rituals. The remains
should be disinfected prior to burial, and buried at
least 90 feet (30 m) away from sources of drinking
water.
A cholera vaccine exists that can be given to travelers and residents of areas where cholera is known to be

presence of V. cholerae bacteria. Cholera can also be
diagnosed by culturing a stool sample in the laboratory to isolate the cholera-causing bacteria. In addition, a blood test may reveal the presence of antibodies
against the cholera bacteria. In areas where cholera
occurs often, however, patients are usually treated for
diarrhea and vomiting symptoms as if they had cholera without laboratory confirmation.

I Cholestasis
Definition
Cholestasis is a condition caused by rapidly developing (acute) or long-term (chronic) interruption in
the excretion of bile (a digestive fluid that helps the
body process fat). The term is taken from the Greek
chole, bile, and stasis, standing still.

Description
Cholestasis is caused by obstruction within the
liver (intrahepatic) or outside the liver (extrahepatic).
The obstruction causes bile salts, the bile pigment
bilirubin, and fats (lipids) to accumulate in the blood
stream instead of being eliminated normally.
Intrahepatic cholestasis is characterized by widespread blockage of small ducts or by disorders, such as
hepatitis, that impair the body’s ability to eliminate bile.
Extrahepatic cholestasis can occur as a side effect of
many medications. It can also occur as a complication
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Pregnancy increases the sensitivity of the bile
ducts to estrogen, and cholestasis often develops during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. This
condition is the second most common cause of jaundice during pregnancy, but generalized itching (pruritus gravidarum) is the only symptom most women
experience. Cholestasis of pregnancy tends to run in
families. Symptoms usually disappear within two to
four weeks after the baby’s birth but may reappear if
the woman becomes pregnant again.
A similar condition affects some women who take
birth control pills. Symptoms disappear after the
woman stops using oral contraceptives. This condition
does not lead to chronic liver disease. A woman who
develops cholestasis from either of these causes (pregnancy or birth control hormones) has an increased risk
of developing cholestasis from the other.

resembling chronic biliary cirrhosis (a progressive disease characterized by destruction of small bile ducts)
persists even after the medication is stopped. Some
patients experience a similar reaction in response to
tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, imipramine),
phenylbutazone (Butazolidin), erythromycin estolate
(Estomycin, Purmycin), and other drugs. Intrahepatic
cholestasis may also be caused by alcoholic liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, cancer that has spread
(metastasized) from another part of the body, and a
number of rare disorders.
Extrahepatic cholestasis is most often caused by a
stone obstructing the passage through which bile travels from the gallbladder to the small intestine (common bile duct) or by pancreatic cancer. Less often, the
condition occurs as a result of non-cancerous narrowing of the common duct (strictures), ductal carcinoma,
or disorders of the pancreas.
Cholestasis caused by the use of steroids causes
little, if any, inflammation. Symptoms develop gradually and usually disappear after the drug is discontinued. Other drugs that can cause cholestasis include:

Benign familial recurrent cholestasis is a rare condition characterized by brief, repeated episodes of
itching and jaundice. Symptoms often disappear.
This condition does not cause cirrhosis.

Drug-induced cholestasis may be a complication
of chemotherapy or other medications. The two major
types of drug-induced cholestasis are direct toxic

Direct toxic reactions develop in 1% of all

amount of medication being taken.

Symptoms of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic
cholestasis include a yellow discoloration of the skin
(jaundice), dark urine, and pale stools. Itching over the
skin may be severe if the condition is advanced.

Intrahepatic cholestasis is usually caused by hepatitis or by medications that can produce symptoms

of surgery, serious injury, tissue-destroying infection, or
intravenous feeding. Extrahepatic cholestasis can be
caused by conditions such as tumors and gallstones
that block the flow of bile from the gallbladder to the
first part of the small intestine (duodenum).

Cholestasis

Patients with advanced cholestasis feel ill, tire
easily, and are often nauseated. Abdominal pain and
such systemic symptoms as anorexia, vomiting, and
fever are usually due to the underlying condition that
causes cholestasis.

Diagnosis
Determining whether obstruction exists inside
or outside the liver is the essential part of diagnosis.
A history of hepatitis or heavy drinking, recent use of
certain drugs, and symptoms like ascites (abnormal
abdominal swelling) and splenomegaly (enlarged
spleen) suggest intrahepatic cholestasis. Pain or rigidity in the gallbladder or pancreas suggest an extrahepatic form.
Blood tests and liver function tests can reveal the
pattern and extent of liver injury, indicate functional
abnormalities, and establish the cause of the condition. However, most misdiagnoses occur when physicians rely more on laboratory analysis than on
detailed medical history and the results of a thorough
physical examination. Special attention should be paid
to three liver function tests. Levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) can indicate
whether the patient’s condition is caused by an
obstructive condition like cholestasis or a disease of
the liver cells (hepatocellular disease) like viral hepatitis or cancer. ALP levels more than three times greater
than normal indicate cholestasis. High levels of AST
and particularly of ALT, which is found predominantly in liver cells, indicate hepatocellular disease.
Once the disease pattern has been established,
ultrasound may be performed to determine whether
obstruction of the large duct has caused widening of
small ducts located close to it. Computed tomography
scans (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can
provide more detailed information about the source of
the obstruction. If these procedures that do not enter
the patient’s body (non-invasive procedures) do not
provide the information a family physician, internist,
or gastroenterologist needs to make a diagnosis of cholestasis, one of these procedures may be performed:


direct cholangiography, an x-ray map of the bile
ducts, enhanced by the use of contrast dye



percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, used to
identify obstructions that impede the flow of bile
from the liver to the digestive system, takes x-ray
images of the bile ducts after a contrast dye has
been injected by a needle passed directly into a hepatic duct

866

KEY TERMS
Bile—A bitter yellow-green substance produced
by the liver. Bile breaks down fats in the small
intestine so that they can be used by the body. It
is stored in the gallbladder and passes from the
gallbladder through the common bile duct to the
top of the small intestine (duodenum) as needed to
digest fat.
Biliary—Of bile or of the gallbladder and bile ducts
that transport bile and make up the biliary system or
tract.
Computed tomography scans (CT)—An imaging
technique in which cross-sectional x rays of the
body are compiled to create a three-dimensional
image of the body’s internal structures.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography—
A diagnostic procedure for mapping the pancreatic
and common bile ducts. A flexible tube with a light
transmitter (fiberoptics) is placed in the duct. A
contrast dye is instilled directly into the duct and
a series of x-ray images are taken.
Hepatic—Of the liver, from the Greek hepar.
Liver function tests—Tests used to evaluate liver
metabolism, storage, filtration, and excretion. The
tests include alkaline phosphatase and serum alanine
aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)—An imaging
technique that uses a large circular magnet and
radio waves to generate signals from atoms in the
body. These signals are used to construct images of
internal structures.
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography—An
x-ray examination of the bile ducts. A needle is
passed through the skin (percutaneous) across or
over the liver (transhepatic) and directly into a bile
duct to inject a contrast dye. The dye enhances the
x-ray image mapping the system of bile ducts
(cholangiography).
Phenothiazine-derivative drugs—A large family of
drugs derived from phenothiazine, a compound that
in itself is too poisonous for human consumption.
Phenothiazine derivatives include tranquilizers,
medications that prevent vomiting, antihistamines,
and drugs used to enhance the effectiveness of
anesthesia.
Ultrasonography—A test using sound waves to
measure blood flow. Gel is applied to a hand-held
transducer that is pressed against the patient’s
body. Images are displayed on a monitor.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP), which uses a special dye to outline the pancreatic and common bile ducts and highlight the
position of any obstruction; a special tube with a
light transmitter is inserted into the duct and a series
of x-ray images is taken

A doctor who thinks a physical obstruction is
responsible for progressive deterioration of a patient’s
condition may consider an exploratory surgical procedure (diagnostic laparotomy). Liver biopsy is sometimes performed if imaging tests do not indicate why a
duct is enlarged, but results of a single biopsy may not
represent the status of the entire organ.

Treatment
The goal of treatment is to eliminate or control the
patient’s symptoms. Discontinuing the use of certain
drugs can restore normal liver function, but surgery
may be needed to drain or remove obstructions or to
widen affected ducts.
Rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane), an antibacterial
drug; phenobarbital, a barbiturate anticonvulsant;
and other drugs are sometimes prescribed to cleanse
the system and eliminate bile salts and other toxic
compounds.
Patients who have chronic cholestasis and have
trouble digesting fat may have to restrict the amount
of fat in their diet and take calcium and water-soluble
vitamin supplements. A liver transplant may become
necessary if complications occur.

Prognosis
Symptoms almost always disappear after the
underlying condition is controlled.
Some patients who have cholestasis experience
symptoms only after infection develops, but chronic
bile-duct obstruction always leads to cirrhosis. It may
also cause osteoporosis (fragile bones) or osteomalacia
(soft bones).

I Cholesterol, high
Definition
Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in animal
tissue and is an important component to the human
body. It is manufactured in the liver and carried
throughout the body in the bloodstream. Problems
can occur when too much cholesterol forms an accumulation of plaque on blood vessel walls, which
impedes blood flow to the heart and other organs.
The highest cholesterol content is found in meat, poultry, shellfish, and dairy products.

Description
Cholesterol is the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of
medicine, since it has both a good side and bad side.
It is necessary to digest fats from food, make hormones, build cell walls, and participate in other processes for maintaining a healthy body. When people

usually are referring to high cholesterol. This can be
somewhat misleading, since there are four components to cholesterol. These are:

LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol

HDL, the so-called good cholesterol

triglycerides, a blood fat lipid that increases the risk

ORGANIZATIONS

High LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is a major
contributing factor of heart disease. The cholesterol
forms plaque in the heart’s blood vessels, which
restricts or blocks the supply of blood to the heart,
and causes a condition called atherosclerosis. This can
lead to a ‘‘heart attack,’’ resulting in damage to the
heart and possibly death. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) estimates that 90 million
American adults, roughly half the adult population,
have elevated cholesterol levels.

cholesterol, obesity, heart attack or stroke, alcoholism,
and lack of regular exercise. The chances of developing high cholesterol increase after the age of 45. One of
the primary causes of high LDL cholesterol is too
much fat or sugar in the diet, a problem especially
true in the United States. Cholesterol also is produced
naturally in the liver and overproduction may occur
even in people who limit their intake of high cholesterol food. Low HDL and high triglyceride levels are
also risk factors for atherosclerosis.

Causes and symptoms
There are no readily apparent symptoms that
indicate high LDL or triglycerides, or low HDL. The
only way to diagnose the problems is through a simple
blood test. However, one general indication of high
cholesterol is obesity. Another is a high-fat diet.

Diagnosis
High cholesterol often is diagnosed and treated by
general practitioners or family practice physicians. In
some cases, the condition is treated by an endocrinologist or cardiologist. Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL,
and triglyceride levels as well as the cholesterol to
HDL ratio are measured by a blood test called a
lipid panel. The cost of a lipid panel is generally
$40–100 and is covered by most health insurance and
HMO plans, including Medicare, providing there is an
appropriate reason for the test. Home cholesterol testing kits are available over the counter but test only for
total cholesterol. The results should only be used as a
868

guide and if the total cholesterol level is high or low, a
lipid panel should be performed by a physician. In
most adults the recommended levels, measured by
milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) of blood, are: total
cholesterol, less than 200; LDL, less than 130; HDL,
more than 35; triglycerides, 30–200; and cholesterol to
HDL ratio, four to one. However, the recommended
cholesterol levels may vary, depending on other risk
factors such as hypertension, a family history of heart
disease, diabetes, age, alcoholism, and smoking.
Doctors have always been puzzled by why some
people develop heart disease while others with identical HDL and LDL levels do not. New studies indicate
it may be due to the size of the cholesterol particles in
the bloodstream. A test called a nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) LipoProfile exposes a blood sample
to a magnetic field to determine the size of the cholesterol particles. Particle size also can be determined by a
centrifugation test, where blood samples are spun very
quickly to allow particles to separate and move at
different distances. The smaller the particles, the
greater the chance of developing heart disease. It
allows physicians to treat patients who have normal
or close to normal results from a lipid panel but
abnormal particle size.

Treatment
A wide variety of prescription medicines are available to treat cholesterol problems. These include statins such as Mevacor (lovastatin), Lescol (fluvastatin),
Pravachol (pravastatin), Zocor (simvastatin), Baycol
(cervastatin), and Lipitor (atorvastatin) to lower
LDL. A group of drugs called fibric acid derivatives
are used to lower triglycerides and raise HDL. These
include Lopid (gemfibrozil), Atromid-S (clofibrate),
and Tricor (fenofibrate). Doctors decide which drug
to use based on the severity of the cholesterol problem,
side effects, and cost.

Alternative treatment
The primary goal of cholesterol treatment is to
lower LDL to under 160 mg/dL in people without
heart disease and who are at lower risk of developing
it. The goal in people with higher risk factors for heart
disease is less than 130 mg/dL. In patients who already
have heart disease, the goal is under 100 mg/dL,
according to FDA guidelines. Also, since low HDL
levels increase the risks of heart disease, the goal of all
patients is more than 35 mg/dL.
In both alternative and conventional treatment of
high cholesterol, the first-line treatment options are
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diet and exercise
Since a large number of people with high cholesterol are overweight, a healthy diet and regular exercise are probably the most beneficial natural ways to
control cholesterol levels. In general, the goal is to
substantially reduce or eliminate foods high in animal
fat. These include meat, shellfish, eggs, and dairy products. Several specific diet options are beneficial. One
is the vegetarian diet. Vegetarians typically get up to
100% more fiber and up to 50% less cholesterol from
food than non-vegetarians. The vegetarian low-cholesterol diet consists of at least six servings of whole
grain foods, three or more servings of green leafy
vegetables, two to four servings of fruit, two to four
servings of legumes, and one or two servings of non-fat
dairy products daily.
A second diet is the Asian diet, with brown rice
being the staple. Other allowable foods include fish,
vegetables such as bok choy, bean sprouts, and black
beans. It allows for one weekly serving of meat and
very few dairy products. The food is flavored with
traditional Asian spices and condiments, such as ginger, chilies, turmeric, and soy sauce.
Another regimen is the low glycemic or diabetic
diet, which can raise the HDL (good cholesterol) level
by as much as 20% in three weeks. Low glycemic foods
promote a slow but steady rise in blood sugar levels
following a meal, which increases the level of HDL.
They also lower total cholesterol and triglycerides.
Low glycemic foods include certain fruits, vegetables,
beans, and whole grains. Processed and refined foods
and sugars should be avoided.
Exercise is an extremely important part of lowering
bad cholesterol and raising good cholesterol. It should
consist of 20–30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise at
least three times a week. Exercises that cause the heart
to beat faster include fast walking, bicycling, jogging,
roller skating, swimming, and walking up stairs. There
are also a wide selection of aerobic programs available
at gyms or on videocassette.
Garlic
A number of clinical studies have indicated that
garlic can offer modest reductions in cholesterol. A
1997 study by nutrition researchers at Pennsylvania
State University found men who took garlic capsules
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

for five months reduced their total cholesterol by
7% and LDL by 12%. Another study showed that
seven cloves of fresh garlic a day significantly
reduced LDL, as did a daily dose of four garlic
extract pills. Other studies in 1997 and 1998 back
up these results. However, two more recent studies
have questioned the effectiveness of garlic in lowering ‘‘bad cholesterol.’’
Cholestin
Cholestin hit the over-the-counter market in 1997
as a cholesterol-lowering dietary supplement. It is a
processed form of red yeast fermented with rice, a
traditional herbal remedy used for centuries by the
Chinese. Two studies released in 1998 showed
Cholestin lowered LDL cholesterol by 20–30%. It
also appeared to raise HDL and lower triglyceride
levels. Although the supplement contains hundreds
of compounds, the major active LDL-lowering ingredient is lovastatin, a chemical also found in the prescription drug Mevacor. The FDA banned Cholestin
in early 1998 but a federal district court judge lifted the
ban a year later, ruling the product was a dietary
supplement, not a drug. It is not fully understood
how the substance works and patients may want to
consult with their physician before taking Cholestin.
No serious side effects have been reported, but minor
side effects, including bloating and heartburn, have
been reported.
Other treatments
One study indicated that blue-green algae contains
polyunsaturated fatty acids that lower cholesterol.
The algae, known as alga Aphanizomenon flos-aquae
(AFA) is available as an over-the-counter dietary supplement. Niacin, also known as nicotinic acid or vitamin B3, has been shown to reduce LDL levels by
10–20%, and raise HDL levels by 15–35%. It also can
reduce triglycerides. But because an extremely high dose
of niacin (2–3) is needed to treat cholesterol problems, it
should only be taken under a doctor’s supervision to
monitor possible toxic side effects. Niacin also can cause
flushing when taken in high doses. Soy protein with
high levels of isoflavones also have been shown to
reduce bad cholesterol by up to 10%. A daily diet that
contains 62 mg of isoflavones in soy protein is recommended, and can be incorporated into other diet regimens, including vegetarian, Asian, and low glycemic. In
2003, research revealed that policosanol, a substance
made from sugar cane wax or beeswax, lowered
LDL cholesterol nearly 27% in study subjects in a
Cuban study.

Prevention
The best way to prevent cholesterol problems is
through a combination of healthy lifestyle activities, a
primarily low-fat and high-fiber diet, regular aerobic
exercise, not smoking, and maintaining an optimal
weight. In a small 2003 Canadian study, people who
ate a low-fat vegetarian diet consisting of foods that
are found to help lower cholesterol dropped their
levels of LDL cholesterol as much as results from
some statin drugs. But for people with high risk factors
for heart disease, such as a family history of heart
disease, diabetes, and being over the age of 45, these
measures may not be enough to prevent the onset of
high cholesterol. There are studies being done on the
effectiveness of some existing anti-cholesterol drugs
for controlling cholesterol levels in patients who do

I Cholesterol-reducing drugs
Definition
Cholesterol-reducing drugs are medicines that
lower the amount of cholesterol (a fat-like substance)
in the blood.

Purpose
Cholesterol is a chemical that can both benefit and
harm the body. On the good side, cholesterol plays
important roles in the structure of cells and in the
production of hormones. But too much cholesterol in
the blood can lead to heart and blood vessel disease.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Many factors may contribute to the fact that some
people have higher cholesterol levels than others. A
diet high in certain types of fats is one factor. Medical
problems such as poorly controlled diabetes, an
underactive thyroid gland, an overactive pituitary
gland, liver disease or kidney failure also may cause
high cholesterol levels. And some people have inherited
disorders that prevent their bodies from properly
using and eliminating fats. This allows cholesterol to
build up in the blood.
Treatment for high cholesterol levels usually
begins with changes in daily habits. By losing weight,
stopping smoking, exercising more and reducing the
amount of fat and cholesterol in the diet, many people
can bring their cholesterol levels down to acceptable
levels. However, some may need to use cholesterolreducing drugs to reduce their risk of health problems.

Description
There are four different classes of cholesterol lowering drugs:
Bile acid sequesterants are drugs that act by binding with the bile produced by the liver. Bile helps the
digestion and absorption of fats in the intestine. By
blocking the digestion of fats, bile acid sequesterants
prevent the formation of cholesterol. Drugs in this
class include: cholestyramine (Questran); colestipol
(Colestid); and colesevalam (Welchol).
HMG-CoA inhibitors, often called ‘‘statins,’’ are
drugs that block an enzyme called ‘‘3-hydroxy-3methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase.’’ This blocks
one of the steps in converting fat to cholesterol. These
are the most effective cholesterol lowering agents available and in recent years have received increased attention for their benefits beyond helping patients with high
cholesterol. In 2003, researchers reported that people
with heart failure but no coronary artery disease
received benefits after only 14 weeks of statin therapy.
In addition, some research has connected the drugs to
reduced risk for depression and dementia. Drugs in this
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

group include: atorvastatin (Lipitor); cerivastatin
(Baycol); fluvastatin (Lescol); lovastatin (Mevacor);
pravastatin (Pravachol); simvastatin (Zocor); and the
newest approved drug rosuvastatin (Crestor).
Fibric acid derivatives include clofibrate
(Atromid-S); gemfibrozil (Lopid); and fenofibrate
(Tricor). Although these drugs are less effective than
the statins at lowering total cholesterol, they may be
able to lower the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol while raising the high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol. They probably act by inhibiting
lipoprotein lipase activity.
Niacin, or vitamin B-3, also is effective in lowering
cholesterol levels. Although the normal vitamin dose
of niacin is only 20 mg, the dose required to reduce
cholesterol levels is at least 500 mg each day. Niacin
probably helps reduce cholesterol by inhibiting very
low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion in the
bloodstream.

Recommended dosage
The recommended dosage depends on the type of
cholesterol-reducing drug used. The prescribing physician or the pharmacist who filled the prescription can
advise about the correct dosage.
Cholesterol-reducing drugs should be taken
exactly as directed and doses should not be missed.
Double doses should not be taken to make up for a
missed dose.
Physicians may prescribe a combination of cholesterol-reducing drugs, such as pravastatin and colestipol. Following the directions for how and when to
take the drugs is very important. The medicine may
not work properly if both drugs are taken at the same
time of day.
Niacin should not be taken at the same time as an
HMG-CoA inhibitor, as this combination may cause
severe muscle problems. If niacin is taken in an overthe-counter form, both the prescribing physician and
pharmacist should be informed. There are no problems
when the niacin is taken in normal doses as a vitamin.
The prescription should not be stopped without
first checking with the physician who prescribed it.
Cholesterol levels may increase when the medicine is
stopped, and the physician may prescribe a special diet
to make this less likely.

Precautions
Seeing a physician regularly while taking cholesterol-reducing drugs is important. The physician will
871

Cholesterol-reducing drugs

To complicate matters, not all cholesterol contributes
to heart and blood vessel problems. One type, called
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or ‘‘good
cholesterol,’’ actually lowers the risk of these problems.
The other type, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or ‘‘bad cholesterol,’’ is the type that threatens
people’s health. The names reflect the way cholesterol
moves through the body. To travel through the bloodstream, cholesterol must attach itself to a protein. The
combination of a protein and a fatty substance like
cholesterol is called a lipoprotein.

Cholesterol-reducing drugs

check to make sure the medicine is working as it
should and will decide whether it is still needed.
Blood tests and other medical tests may be ordered
to help the physician monitor the drug’s effectiveness
and check for side effects.
For most people, cholesterol-reducing drugs are
just one part of a whole program for lowering cholesterol levels. Other important elements of the program
may include weight loss, exercise, special diets, and
changes in other habits. The medication should never
be viewed as a substitute for other measures ordered
by the physician. Cholesterol-reducing drugs will not
cure problems that cause high cholesterol; they will
only help control cholesterol levels.
People over 60 years of age may be unusually
sensitive to the effects of some cholesterol-reducing
drugs. This may increase the chance of side effects.
Anyone who is taking an HMG-CoA reductase
inhibitor should notify the health care professional in
charge before having any surgical or dental procedures or receiving emergency treatment.
Special conditions
People who have certain medical conditions or
who are taking certain other medications may have
problems if they take cholesterol-reducing drugs.
Before taking these drugs, the prescribing physician
should be informed of any of the following conditions:
ALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions to cholesterol-reducing drugs in the past should
inform the prescribing physician before taking the
drugs again. The physician also should be told about
any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or other
substances.
PREGNANCY. Studies of laboratory animals have

shown that giving high doses of gemfibrozil during
pregnancy increases the risk of birth defects and other
problems, including death of the unborn baby. The
effects of this drug have not been studied in pregnant
women. Women who are pregnant or who may
become pregnant should check with their physicians
before using gemfibrozil.
Cholesterol-reducing drugs in the group known
as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (such as lovastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin)
should not be taken by women who are pregnant or
who plan to become pregnant soon. By blocking the
production of cholesterol, these drugs prevent a fetus
from developing properly. Women who are able to
bear children should use an effective birth control
method while taking these drugs. Any woman who
872

becomes pregnant while taking these drugs should
check with her physician immediately.
Cholestyramine and colestipol will not directly
harm an unborn baby, because these drugs are not
taken into the body. However, the drugs may keep
the mother’s body from absorbing vitamins that she
and the baby need. Pregnant women who take these
drugs should ask their physicians whether they need to
take extra vitamins.
BREASTFEEDING. Because cholestyramine and
colestipol interfere with the absorption of vitamins,
women who use these drugs while breastfeeding
should ask their physicians if they need to take extra
vitamins.

Women who are breastfeeding should talk to their
physicians before using gemfibrozil. Whether this
drug passes into breast milk is not known. But
because animal studies suggest that it may increase
the risk of some types of cancer, women should carefully consider the safety of using it while breastfeeding.
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (such as lovastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin and simvastatin)
should not be used by women who are breastfeeding
their babies.
OTHER
MEDICAL
CONDITIONS. Cholesterolreducing drugs may make some medical problems
worse. Before using these drugs, people with any of
these medical conditions should make sure their physicians are aware of their conditions:


stomach problems, including stomach ulcer

I Cholesterol test
Definition
The cholesterol test is a quantitative analysis of
the cholesterol levels in a sample of the patient’s blood.
Total serum cholesterol (TC) is the measurement routinely taken. Doctors sometimes order a complete
lipoprotein profile to better evaluate the risk for atherosclerosis (coronary artery disease, or CAD). The full
lipoprotein profile also includes measurements of triglyceride levels (a chemical compound that forms 95%
of the fats and oils stored in animal or vegetable cells)
and lipoproteins (high density and low density). Blood
fats also are called ‘‘lipids.’’ It is estimated that more
than 200 million cholesterol tests are performed each
year in the United States.
The type of cholesterol in the blood is as important as the total quantity. Cholesterol is a fatty substance and cannot be dissolved in water. It must
combine with a protein molecule called a lipoprotein
in order to be transported in the blood. There are five
major types of lipoproteins in the human body; they
differ in the amount of cholesterol that they carry in
comparison to other fats and fatty acids, and in their
functions in the body. Lipoproteins are classified, as
follows, according to their density:


Chylomicrons. These are normally found in the blood
only after a person has eaten foods containing fats.

874

Because of the difference in density and cholesterol content of lipoproteins, two patients with the
same total cholesterol level can have very different
lipid profiles and different risk for CAD. The critical
factor is the level of HDL cholesterol in the blood
serum. Some doctors use the ratio of the total cholesterol level to HDL cholesterol when assessing the
patient’s degree of risk. A low TC/HDL ratio is associated with a lower degree of risk.

Purpose
The purpose of the TC test is to measure the levels
of cholesterol in the patient’s blood. The patient’s
cholesterol also can be fractionated (separated into
different portions) in order to determine the TC/
HDL ratio. The results help the doctor assess the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

In addition, the results of the cholesterol test can
assist the doctor in evaluating the patient’s metabolism of fat, or in diagnosing inflammation of the pancreas, liver disease, or disorders of the thyroid gland.
The frequency of cholesterol testing depends on the
patient’s degree of risk for CAD. People with low cholesterol levels may need to be tested once every five
years. People with high levels of blood cholesterol
should be tested more frequently, according to their
doctor’s advice. The doctor may recommend a detailed
evaluation of the different types of lipids in the patient’s
blood. It is ideal to check the HDL and triglycerides as
well as the cholesterol and LDL. In addition, the
National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) suggests further evaluation if the patient has any of the
symptoms of CAD or if she or he has two or more of the
following risk factors for CAD:


male sex

The necessity of widespread cholesterol screening
is a topic with varying responses. In 2003, a report
demonstrated that measuring the cholesterol of everyone at age 50 years was a simple and efficient way to
identify those most at risk for heart disease from
among the general population.

Precautions
Patients who are seriously ill or hospitalized for
surgery should not be given cholesterol tests because
the results will not indicate the patient’s normal cholesterol level. Acute illness, high fever, starvation, or
recent surgery lowers blood cholesterol levels.

get an accurate triglyceride and LDL level. The blood
is withdrawn by the usual vacuum tube technique
from one of the patient’s veins. The blood test takes
between three and five minutes.

Preparation
Patients who are scheduled for a lipid profile test
should fast (except for water) for 12–14 hours before
the blood sample is drawn. If the patient’s cholesterol
is to be fractionated, he or she also should avoid
alcohol for 24 hours before the test.
Patients also should stop taking any medications
that may affect the accuracy of the test results. These
include corticosteroids, estrogen or androgens, oral
contraceptives, some diuretics, haloperidol, some antibiotics, and niacin. Antilipemics are drugs that lower
the concentration of fatty substances in the blood.
When these are taken by the patient, blood testing
may be done frequently to evaluate the liver function
as well as lipids. The patient’s doctor will give the
patient a list of specific medications to be discontinued
before the test.

Aftercare
Aftercare includes routine care of the skin around
the needle puncture. Most patients have no aftereffects, but some may have a small bruise or swelling.
A washcloth soaked in warm water usually relieves
discomfort. In addition, the patient should resume
taking any prescription medications that were discontinued before the test.

Risks
The primary risk to the patient is a mild stinging
or burning sensation during the venipuncture, with
minor swelling or bruising afterward.

Normal results

A pharmaceutical corporation announced in the
spring of 2004 that it had received an application to
patent a device that could use saliva to determine cholesterol levels. If the test becomes available, it could
make screening much more convenient and accessible.

The ‘‘normal’’ values for serum lipids depend on
the patient’s age, sex, and race. Normal values for
people in Western countries were once presumed to
be 140–220 mg/dL in adults, although as many as 5%
of the population has TC higher than 300 mg/dL.
Among Asians, the figures are about 20% lower. As
a rule, both TC and LDL levels rise as people get older.
However, in 2001, the NCEP released stricter guidelines for LDL and total cholesterol.

The cholesterol test requires a sample of the
patient’s blood. Fasting before the test is required to

LDL levels are associated with increased risk of CAD
whereas high HDL levels are associated with relatively
lower risk.

Cholesterol test

‘‘normal’’ refers to statistically average levels that may
still be too high for good health. The NCEP has outlined the levels according to desirable and risk:


Optimal LDL cholesterol: less than 100 mg/dL and
total cholesterol less than 160 mg/dL



Desirable LDL cholesterol: 100–129 mg/dL; total
cholesterol 160–199 mg/dL



Borderline high risk: LDL cholesterol 130–159 mg/dL;
total cholesterol 200–239 mg/dL



High risk: LDL cholesterol greater than 160 mg/dL;
total cholesterol greater than or at 240 mg/dL.

Abnormal results
It is possible for blood cholesterol levels to be too
low as well as too high.
Abnormally low levels
TC levels less than 160 mg/dL are associated with
higher mortality rates from cancer, liver disease,
respiratory disorders, and injuries. The connection
between unusually low cholesterol and increased mortality is not clear, although some researchers think
that the low level is a secondary sign of the underlying
disease and not the cause of disease or death.
Low levels of serum cholesterol are also associated with malnutrition or hyperthyroidism. Further
diagnostic testing may be necessary in order to locate
the cause.
Abnormally high levels
Prior to 1980, hypercholesterolemia (an abnormally high TC level) was defined as any value above
the 95th percentile for the population. These figures
ranged from 210 mg/dL in persons younger than 20 to
more than 280 mg/dL in persons older than 60. It is
now known, however, that TC levels over 200 mg/dL
are associated with significantly higher risk of CAD.
Levels of 280 mg/dL or more are considered elevated.
Treatment with diet and medication has proven to
successfully lower risk of heart attack and stroke.
Elevated cholesterol levels also may result from
hepatitis, blockage of the bile ducts, disorders of lipid
metabolism, nephrotic syndrome, inflammation of the
pancreas, or hypothyroidism.

Definition

Cholinergic—Nerves that are stimulated by
acetylcholine.
Glaucoma—A disease of the eye marked by
increased pressure within the eyeball that can result
in damage to the optic disk and gradual loss of vision.

Cholinergic drugs are medications that produce the
same effects as the parasympathetic nervous system.

Purpose

Myasthenia gravis—A disease characterized by
progressive weakness and exhaustibility of voluntary muscles without atrophy or sensory disturbance
and caused by an autoimmune attack on acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions.

Cholinergic drugs produce the same effects as
acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is the most common neurohormone of the parasympathetic nervous system, the
part of the peripheral nervous system responsible for the
every day work of the body. While the sympathetic
nervous system acts during times of excitation, the parasympathetic system deals with everyday activities such
as salivation, digestion, and muscle relaxation.
The cholinergic drugs may be used in several
ways. The cholinergic muscle stimulants are used to
diagnose and treat myasthenia gravis, a disease that
causes severe muscle weakness. This class of drugs
includes ambenonium chloride (Mytelase), edrophonium chloride (Tensilon), neostigmine (Prostigmine),
and piridogstimina (Mestinœn). These drugs are also
widely used in surgery, both to reduce the risk of
urinary retention, and to reverse the effects of the
muscle relaxant drugs that are used in surgery.
Cholinergic drugs are also used in control of glaucoma, a disease that is caused by increased pressure
inside the eye. The most common drugs used for this
purpose are demecarium (Humorsol) and echthiophate (Phospholine iodide).

Description
Cholinergic drugs usually act in one of two
ways. Some directly mimic the effect of acetylcholine,
while others block the effects of acetylcholinesterase.
Acetylcholinesterase is an enzyme that destroys naturally occurring acetylcholine. By blocking the enzyme,
the naturally occurring acetylcholine has a longer
action.

Recommended dosage
Cholinergic drugs are available only by prescription. They may be available as eye drops, capsules,
tablets, or injections.

Precautions
Cholinergic drugs should be avoided when the
patient has any sort of obstruction in the urinary or

nervous system that contains chiefly cholinergic

digestive tracts, such a a tumor, or severe inflammation which is causing blockage.
They should be used with caution in patients with
asthma, epilepsy, slow heart beat, hyperthyroidism, or
gastric ulcers.
The effects of the cholinergic drugs are to produce the same effects as stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system. These effects include
slowing of the heartbeat, increases in normal secretions including the digestive acids of the stomach,
saliva and tears. For this reason, patients who
already have a problem in one of these areas, such
as a slow heartbeat or stomach ulcers, should use
these drugs with great caution, since the medication
will make their conditions worse.

Side effects
When used properly, cholinergic drugs will
increase muscle strength in patients with myasthenia
gravis. In eye drop form, they can reduce the intraoccular pressure in glaucoma.
The possible adverse effects of cholinergic drugs are:

slow heart beat, possibly leading to cardiac arrest.

I Chondromalacia patellae
Definition
Chondromalacia patellae refers to the progressive
erosion of the articular cartilage of the knee joint, that
is the cartilage underlying the kneecap (patella) that
articulates with the knee joint.

Description
Chondromalacia patellae (CMP), also known as
patello-femoral pain syndrome or patello-femoral
stress syndrome, is a syndrome that causes pain/discomfort at the front of the knee. It is associated with
irritation or wear on the underside of the kneecap, or
patella. In a normal knee, the articular cartilage is
smooth and elastic and glides smoothly over the surface of the thighbone, or femur, when the knee is bent.
Erosion of the cartilage roughens the surface and prevents this smooth action.
CMP is most common in adolescent females,
although older people may also develop it. An average
of two out of 10,000 people develop this condition,
many of them runners or other athletes.

Causes and symptoms
CMP is the result of the normal aging process,
overuse, injury, or uneven pressures exerted on the
knee joint. In teens, CMP may be caused by uneven
growth or uneven strength in the thigh muscles.
Growth spurts, common in teens, may result in a
mildly abnormal alignment of the patella, which
increases the angle formed by the thigh and the
patellar tendon (Q-angle). This condition adds to
the damage. Symptoms include pain, normally around
the kneecap, and a grinding sensation felt when
extending the leg. The pain may radiate to the back
878

Diagnosis is established during a physical examination performed by a general practitioner or an
orthopedist, and is based on frequency of symptoms
and confirmed by x rays of the knee. The CMP erosion
can also be seen on an MRI, although this type of scan
is not routinely performed for this purpose. The
patient should inform the doctor about any previous
injuries to the joint.

Treatment
Initial treatment may consist of resting the knee
using crutches, along with aspirin, Tylenol, or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as
Motrin for seven to 10 days. The person should limit
sports activity until the joint is healed and may use ice
followed by heat to decrease inflammation. When the
doctor allows the patient to resume sports, a knee
brace may be prescribed in the form of a stabilizer
with a hole at the kneecap.
Treatment also includes low impact exercises to
strengthen the quadriceps muscles which help stabilize
the knee joint. Physical therapy may be suggested
at the start of this program so as to help the patient
learn the correct method of performing the exercises.
Approximately 85% of people do well with conservative CMP treatment. The remainder still have
severe pain and may require arthroscopic surgery to
repair the tissues inside the knee joint. In more severe
cases, open surgery may be required to realign the
kneecap and perhaps other corrections.

Alternative treatments
Physical therapy offers treatments that may help
CMP patients. Aqua therapy has the benefit of exercising the knee without putting stress on it and it also
strengthens the thigh muscles. Biofeedback can be used
to learn tensing and relaxing specific muscles to relieve
pain. These techniques have the benefit of no side
effects. Massage therapy might be beneficial as well.
Calcium, minerals, and vitamins as part of a balanced
diet will aid healing and help prevent further problems.

Prognosis
In most teens with CMP, the prognosis is excellent
since the damage is reversible when treatment starts

before the cartilage begins to break down. With
proper treatment and preventive techniques, teenagers
will complete their growth without permanent damage
to the joint. Only about 15% of patients require surgical intervention. Older people may go on to develop
osteoarthritis in the knee.

Prevention
Proper exercises are the best preventive measure.
Since tightness of thigh muscles is a risk factor, warming up before athletic activities is recommended, as well
as participating in a variety of sports rather than just
one. Stretching exercises increase flexibility of the quadriceps, hip flexors, and hamstrings. Strengthening exercises such as short arc leg extensions, straight leg raises,
quadriceps isometric exercises, and stationary bicycling
are also recommended.

I Choriocarcinoma
Definition
A choriocarcinoma is type of cancer germ cell
containing trophoblast cells.

Description
Choriocarcinomas are cancers that develop from
germ cells, cells that ordinarily turn into sperm or eggs.
Choriocarcinomas resemble the cells that surround an
embryo in the uterus. Most of these cancers form
inside the reproductive organs. Some originate in the
testes or ovaries, especially in young adults. Others
develop in the uterus after a pregnancy or miscarriage—particularly often after a mole. A few choriocarcinomas arise in sites outside the reproductive
organs. Such ‘‘extragonadal’’ tumors are usually
found in young adults and are more common in males.
Choriocarcinomas are one of the most dangerous
germ cell cancers. Choriocarcinomas usually grow
quickly and spread widely. Occasionally, this cancer
grows so fast that the original tumor outgrows its
blood supply and dies, leaving behind only a small scar.

Causes and symptoms
Choriocarcinomas result from genetic damage to
a germ cell. Males with Klinefelter syndrome are especially likely to develop extragonadal germ cell tumors.
The symptoms of a choriocarcinoma vary,
depending on where the tumor originates and where
it spreads. In the uterus, the most common symptom is
bleeding. Cancers in the ovary often have only subtle
signs such as widening of the waistline or pain. In the
testes, choriocarcinomas can often be felt as small
painless lumps. Choriocarcinomas that spread to
other organs may reveal their presence by bleeding.
In the brain, this bleeding can cause a stroke.

Diagnosis
Choriocarcinomas are usually referred to an
oncologist, a doctor who specializes in cancer treatment. To diagnose this tumor, the doctor will do a
physical examination and examine the internal organs
with x rays or ultrasound studies. Choriocarcinomas
are not always biopsied before being treated, because
they tend to bleed heavily. Spreading of the cancer is
detected with x rays, ultrasound studies, computed
tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) scans.
879

Choriocarcinoma

KEY TERMS

Choriocarcinoma

Most choriocarcinomas make human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone normally found
only during pregnancy. The presence of hCG in the
blood can help diagnose this cancer and monitor the
success of treatment.

Treatment
Choriocarcinomas are usually treated by surgical
removal of the tumor and chemotherapy. Radiation is
occasionally used, particularly for tumors in the brain.

Alternative treatment
Complementary treatments can decrease stress,
reduce the side effects of cancer treatment, and help
patients feel more in control. For instance, some people
find activities such as yoga, massage, music therapy,
meditation, prayer, or mild physical exercise helpful.

Prognosis
The prognosis for choriocarcinomas in the uterus
is very good. Although these tumors have often spread
throughout the body, chemotherapy results in a cure
or remission in at least 80–90% of cases. Women who
have had choriocarcinomas often go on to have normal pregnancies and deliveries.
Choriocarcinomas in other sites have a poorer
prognosis. These tumors tend to spread quickly and
don’t always respond well to chemotherapy. Although
treatment can be effective, the outcome usually depends
on how widely the cancer is dispersed. Generally, the
prognosis is worse if the cancer can be found in the liver
or brain, if hCG levels are high, or if the original tumor
developed outside the gonads. Five-year survival with
testicular cancers can range from 92% for tumors that
have spread only to the lungs to 48% to tumors that
have spread to other internal organs.

Prevention
There is no known means of prevention.
However, early detection of the symptoms and prompt
medical treatment can improve the odds of survival.

I Chorionic villus sampling
Definition
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), also known as

Purpose
Chorionic villus sampling is performed on pregnant women who are at risk for carrying a fetus with a

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Precautions
Chorionic villus sampling is not recommended for
women who have vaginal bleeding or spotting during
the pregnancy. It is not typically recommended for
women who have Rh sensitization from a previous
pregnancy.

Description
Chorionic villus sampling has been in use since the
1980s. This prenatal testing procedure involves taking
a sample of the chorion frondosum–that part of the
chorionic membrane containing the villi–for laboratory analysis. The chorionic membrane is the outer sac
which surrounds the developing fetus. Chorionic villi
are microscopic, finger-like projections that emerge
from the chorionic membrane and eventually form
the placenta. The cells that make up the chorionic
villi are of fetal origin so laboratory analysis can identify any genetic, chromosomal, or biochemical diseases of the fetus.
Chorionic villus sampling is best performed
between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy. The procedure
is performed either through the vagina and the cervix
(transcervically) or through the abdomen (transabdominally) depending upon the preferences of the
patient or the doctor. In some cases, the location of the
placenta dictates which method the doctor uses. Both
methods are equally safe and effective. Following the
preparation time, both procedures take only about
five minutes. Women undergoing chorionic villus
sampling may experience no pain at all or feel cramping or pinching. Occasionally, a second sampling procedure must be performed if insufficient villus material
was obtained.
For the transcervical procedure, the woman lies
on an examining table on her back with her feet in
stirrups. The woman’s vaginal area is thoroughly
cleansed with an antiseptic, a sterile speculum is
inserted into her vagina and opened, and the cervix
is cleansed with an antiseptic. Using ultrasound

Chorionic villus sampling is performed on pregnant women who are at risk for carrying a fetus with a genetic or chromosomal
defect. This procedure can be performed through the vagina and the cervix (transcervically) or through the abdomen (transabdominally). In the transcervical procedure, as depicted above, the physician uses ultrasound to help guide a catheter through
the cervix into the uterus. By applying suction from the syringe attached to the other end of the catheter, a small sample of the
chorionic villi are obtained. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)

organs) as a guide, the doctor inserts a thin, plastic
tube called a catheter through the cervix and into the
uterus. The passage of the catheter through the cervix
may cause cramping. The doctor carefully watches
the image produced by the ultrasound and advances
the catheter to the chorionic villi. By applying suction
from the syringe attached to the other end of the
catheter, a small sample of the chorionic villi are
obtained. A cramping or pinching feeling may be
felt as the sample is being taken. The catheter is
then easily withdrawn.
For the transabdominal method, the woman lies
on her back on an examining table. Ultrasound
enables the doctor to locate the placenta. The specific
area on the woman’s abdomen is cleansed thoroughly
with an antiseptic and a local anesthetic may be
injected to numb the area. With ultrasound guidance,
a long needle is inserted through the woman’s abdominal wall, through the uterine wall and to the chorionic
villi. The sample is obtained by applying suction from
the syringe.

At the laboratory, the sample is examined under the
microscope and any contaminating cells or material is
carefully removed. The villi can be analyzed immediately, or incubated for a day or more to allow for cell
division. The cells are stopped in the midst of cell
division and spread onto a microscope slide. Cells
with clearly separated chromosomes are photographed so that the type and number of chromosomes
can be analyzed. Chromosomes are strings of DNA
which have been tightly compressed. Humans have 23
pairs of chromosomes including the sex chromosomes.
Rearrangements of the chromosomes or the presence
of additional or fewer chromosomes can be identified
by examination of the photograph. Down syndrome,
for instance, is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. In addition to the chromosomal analysis,
specialized tests can be performed as needed to look
for specific diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease.
Depending upon which tests are performed, results
may be available as early as two days or up to eight
days after the procedure.

The chorionic villus sample is immediately placed
into nutrient medium and sent to the laboratory.

Chorionic villus sampling costs between $1,200
and $1,800. Insurance coverage for this test may vary.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

There are alternate procedures for diagnosing
genetic and chromosomal disorders of the fetus.
Amniocentesis is commonly used and involves inserting a needle through the pregnant woman’s abdomen
to obtain a sample of amniotic fluid. Amniocentesis is
usually performed in the second trimester at approximately 16 weeks gestation and the laboratory analysis may take two to three weeks. The two advantages
of chorionic villus sampling are that it is performed
during the first trimester and the results are available
in about one week. However, as of 1997, amniocentesis is being performed in the first trimester, but this is
still very rare. The risk of miscarriage after amniocentesis is 0.5–1% (one to two women out of 200)
which is lower than that for chorionic villus sampling
(1–3%).
A noninvasive alternative is the maternal blood
test called triple marker screening or multiple marker
screening. A sample of the pregnant woman’s blood is
analyzed for three different markers: alphafetoprotein
(AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated estriol. The levels of these three markers in the
mother’s blood can identify unborn babies who are at
risk for certain genetic or chromosomal defects. This is
a screening test which determines the chance that the
fetus has the defect, but it can not diagnose defects.
A negative test result does not necessarily mean the
unborn baby does not have a birth defect. For
instance, this screening test can only predict 60–70%
of the fetuses with Down syndrome. Pregnant women
who have a positive triple marker screen are encouraged to undergo a diagnostic test, such as amniocentesis (by the time an AFP is done, it is too late to
perform a CVS).

Preparation
Prior to the chorionic villus sampling procedure
the woman needs to drink fluids and refrain from
urinating to ensure her bladder is full. These preparations create a better ultrasound picture.

Aftercare
It is generally recommended that women undergoing chorionic villus sampling have someone drive

Women with Rh negative blood must receive a Rho
(D) immune globulin injection following the procedure. Women should call their doctor if they experience excessive bleeding, vaginal discharge, fever, or
abdominal pain after the procedure.

KEY TERMS
Chorionic villi—Microscopic, finger-like projections that emerge from the outer sac which surrounds the developing baby. Chorionic villi are of
fetal origin and eventually form the placenta.
Chromosomes—Human cells carry DNA in tightly
compressed rod-like structures called chromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes
including the sex chromosomes.
Down syndrome—A chromosomal disorder
caused by an extra copy or a rearrangement of
chromosome 21. Children with Down syndrome
have varying degrees of mental retardation and
may have heart defects.
Fetus—Term for an unborn baby after the eighth
week of pregnancy. Prior to seven weeks, it is
called an embryo.
Rh sensitization—A woman with a negative blood
type (Rh negative) who has produced antibodies
against her fetus with a positive blood type (Rh
positive). The mother’s body considered the fetal
blood cells a foreign object and mounted an
immune attack on it.
Ultrasound—A safe, painless procedure which
uses sound waves to visualize internal organs.
A wand that transmits and receives the sound
waves is moved over the woman’s abdomen and
internal organs can be seen on a video screen.

Risks
Of women who undergo transcervical chorionic villus sampling, one third experience minimal vaginal spotting and 7–10% experience vaginal bleeding. One out of
five women experience cramping following the procedure. Two to three women out of 100 (or 2–3%) will
miscarry following chorionic villus sampling. The risk of
infection is very low. Rupture of the amniotic membranes is a rare complication. Women with Rh negative
blood may be at an increased risk for developing Rh
incompatibility following chorionic villus sampling.
There have been reports of limb defects in babies
following chorionic villus sampling. However, in 1996
the World Health Organization reported that the incidence of babies born with limb defects from 138,966
women who had undergone chorionic villus sampling
was the same as for women who had not. Therefore,
this study found no connection between chorionic
villus sampling and limb defects.

I Chronic fatigue syndrome

CFS is the most common name for this disorder,
but it also has been called chronic fatigue and immune
disorder (CFIDS), myalgic encephalomyelitis, low
natural killer cell disease, post-viral syndrome,
Epstein-Barr disease, and Yuppie flu. CFS has so
many names because researchers have been unable to
find out exactly what causes it and because there are
many similar, overlapping conditions. Reports of a
CFS-like syndrome called neurasthenia date back to
1869. Later, people with similar symptoms were said
to have fibromyalgia because one of the main symptoms is myalgia, or muscle pain. Because of the similarity of symptoms, fibromyalgia and CFS are
considered to be overlapping syndromes.
In the early to mid-1980s, there were outbreaks
of CFS in some areas of the United States. Doctors
found that many people with CFS had high levels of
antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which
causes mononucleosis, in their blood. For a while
they thought they had found the culprit, but it turned
out that many healthy people also had high EBV
antibodies. Scientists have also found high levels of
other viral antibodies in the blood of people with
CFS. These findings have led many scientists to
believe that a virus or combination of viruses may
trigger CFS.
CFS was sometimes referred to as Yuppie flu
because it seemed to often affect young, middle-class
professionals. In fact, CFS can affect people of any
gender, age, race, or socioeconomic group. Although
anyone can get CFS, most patients diagnosed with
CFS are 25–45 years old, and about 80% of cases are
in women. Estimates of how many people are afflicted
with CFS vary due to the similarity of CFS symptoms
to other diseases and the difficulty in identifying it.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) has estimated that four to 10 people per
100,000 in the United States have CFS. According to
the CFIDS Foundation, about 500,000 adults in the
United States (0.3% of the population) have CFS.
This probably is a low estimate since these figures do
not include children and are based on the CDC definition of CFS, which is very strict for research purposes.

Definition
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a condition
that causes extreme tiredness. People with CFS have
debilitating fatigue that lasts for six months or longer.
They also have many other symptoms. Some of these
are pain in the joints and muscles, headache, and sore
throat. CFS does not have a known cause, but appears
to result from a combination of factors.
884

Causes and symptoms
There is no single known cause for CFS. Studies
have pointed to several different conditions that might
be responsible. These include:


viral infections



chemical toxins
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

allergies



trouble concentrating



immune abnormalities



memory loss



psychological disorders

A recent study at Johns Hopkins University found
an abnormality in blood pressure regulation in 22 of
23 patients with CFS. This abnormality, called neurally mediated hypotension, causes a sudden drop in
blood pressure when a person has been standing, exercising or exposed to heat for a while. When this occurs,
patients feel lightheaded and may faint. They often are
exhausted for hours to days after one of these episodes. When treated with salt and medications to stabilize blood pressure, many patients in the study had
marked improvements in their CFS symptoms.

Although the cause is still controversial, many doctors and researchers now think that CFS may not be a
single illness. Instead, they think CFS may be a group
of symptoms caused by several conditions. One theory
is that a microorganism, such as a virus, or a chemical
injures the body and damages the immune system,
allowing dormant viruses to become active. About
90% of all people have a virus in the herpes family
dormant (not actively growing or reproducing) in
their bodies since childhood. When these viruses start
growing again, the immune system may overreact and
produce chemicals called cytokines that can cause flulike symptoms. Immune abnormalities have been found
in studies of people with CFS, although the same
abnormalities are also found in people with allergies,
autoimmune diseases, cancer, and other disorders.
The role of psychological problems in CFS is very
controversial. Because many people with CFS are
diagnosed with depression and other psychiatric disorders, some experts conclude that the symptoms of
CFS are psychological. However, many people with
CFS did not have psychological disorders before getting the illness. Many doctors think that patients
become depressed or anxious because of the effects
of the symptoms of their CFS. One recent study concluded that depression was the result of CFS and was
not its cause.
Having CFS is not just a matter of being tired.
People with CFS have severe fatigue that keeps them
from performing their normal daily activities. They
find it difficult or impossible to work, attend school,
or even to take part in social activities. They may have
sleep disturbances that keep them from getting enough
rest or they may sleep too much. Many people with
CFS feel just as tired after a full night’s sleep as before
they went to bed. When they exercise or try to be active
in spite of their fatigue, people with CFS experience
what some patients call ‘‘payback’’–debilitating
exhaustion that can confine them to bed for days.
Other symptoms of CFS include:


muscle pain (myalgia)



joint pain (arthralgia)



sore throat



headache



fever and chills



tender lymph nodes

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis
CFS is diagnosed by evaluating symptoms and
eliminating other causes of fatigue. Doctors carefully
question patients about their symptoms, any other illnesses they have had, and medications they are taking.
They also conduct a physical examination, neurological
examination, and laboratory tests to identify any
underlying disorders or other diseases that cause fatigue. In the United States, many doctors use the CDC
case definition to determine if a patient has CFS.
To be diagnosed with CFS, patients must meet
both of the following criteria:


Unexplained continuing or recurring chronic fatigue
for at least six months that is of new or definite onset,
is not the result of ongoing exertion, and is not
mainly relieved by rest, and causes occupational,
educational, social, or personal activities to be
greatly reduced.



Four or more of the following symptoms: loss of
short-term memory or ability to concentrate; sore
throat; tender lymph nodes; muscle pain; multijoint pain without swelling or redness; headaches of
a new type, pattern, or severity; unrefreshing sleep;
and post-exertional malaise (a vague feeling of discomfort or tiredness following exercise or other physical or mental activity) lasting more than 24 hours.
These symptoms must have continued or recurred
during six or more consecutive months of illness
and must not have started before the fatigue began.

Treatment
There is no cure for CFS, but many treatments are
available to help relieve the symptoms. Treatments
usually are individualized to each person’s particular
symptoms and needs. The first treatment most doctors
recommend is a combination of rest, exercise, and a
885

balanced diet. Prioritizing activities, avoiding overexertion, and resting when needed are key to maintaining
existing energy reserves. A program of moderate exercise helps to keep patients from losing physical conditioning, but too much exercise can worsen fatigue and
other CFS symptoms. Counseling and stress reduction
techniques also may help some people with CFS.
Many medications, nutritional supplements, and
herbal preparations have been used to treat CFS.
While many of these are unproven, others seem to
provide some people with relief. People with CFS
should discuss their treatment plan with their doctors,
and carefully weigh the benefits and risks of each
therapy before making a decision.
Drugs
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
such as ibuprofen and naproxen, may be used to
relieve pain and reduce fever. Another medication
that is prescribed to relieve pain and muscle spasms is
cyclobenzaprine (sold as Flexeril).
Many doctors prescribe low dosages of antidepressants for their sedative effects and to relieve symptoms
of depression. Antianxiety drugs, such as benzodiazepines or buspirone may be prescribed for excessive
anxiety that has lasted for at least six months.
Other medications that have been tested or are
being tested for treatment of CFS are:


Fludrocortisone (Florinef), a synthetic steroid, which
is currently being tested for treatment of people with
CFS. It causes the body to retain salt, thereby increasing blood pressure. It has helped some people with
CFS who have neurally mediated hypotension.



Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, often prescribed for
high blood pressure. Such drugs, including atenolol
(Tenoretic, Tenormin) and propranolol (Inderal),
are sometimes prescribed for neurally mediated
hypotension.



Gamma globulin, which contains human antibodies
to a variety of organisms that cause infection. It has
been used experimentally to boost immune function
in people with CFS.



Ampligen, a drug which stimulates the immune system
and has antiviral activity. In one small study, ampligen
improved mental function in people with CFS.

Alternative treatment
A variety of nutritional supplements are used for
treatment of CFS. Among these are vitamin C, vitamin
B12, vitamin A, vitamin E, and various dietary minerals.
886

KEY TERMS

Cytokines—Proteins produced by certain types of
lymphocytes. They are important controllers of
immune functions.
Depression—A psychological condition, with feelings of sadness, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and
inability to concentrate.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)—A virus in the herpes
family that causes mononucleosis.
Fibromyalgia—A disorder closely related to CFS.
Symptoms include pain, tenderness, and muscle
stiffness.
Lymph node—Small immune organs containing
lymphocytes. They are found in the neck, armpits,
groin, and other locations in the body.
Lymphocytes—White blood cells that are responsible for the actions of the immune system.
Mononucleosis—A flu-like illness caused by the
Epstein-Barr virus.
Myalgia—Muscle pain.
Myalgic encephalomyelitis—An older name for
chronic fatigue syndrome; encephalomyelitis refers
to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.
Natural killer (NK) cell—A lymphocyte that acts as
a primary immune defense against infection.
Neurally mediated hypotension—A rapid fall in
blood pressure that causes dizziness, blurred
vision, and fainting, and is often followed by prolonged fatigue.
Neurasthenia—Nervous exhaustion–a disorder
with symptoms of irritability and weakness, commonly diagnosed in the late 1800s.

These supplements may help improve immune
and mental functions. Several herbs have been shown
to improve immune function and have other beneficial
effects. Some that are used for CFS are astragalus
(Astragalus membranaceus), echinacea (Echinacea
spp.), garlic (Allium sativum), ginseng (Panax ginseng),
gingko (Gingko biloba), evening primrose oil
(Oenothera biennis), shiitake mushroom extract
(Lentinus edodes), borage seed oil, and quercetin.
Many people have enhanced their healing process
for CFS with the use of a treatment program inclusive
of one or more alternative therapies. Stress reduction
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Prognosis
The course of CFS varies widely for different
people. Some people get progressively worse over
time, while others gradually improve. Some individuals have periods of illness that alternate with periods of good health. While many people with CFS
never fully regain their health, they find relief from
symptoms and adapt to the demands of the disorder
by carefully following a treatment plan combining
adequate rest, nutrition, exercise, and other therapies.

Prevention
Because the cause of CFS is not known, there
currently are no recommendations for preventing the
disorder.

granulomatous
I Chronic
disease
Definition
Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an
inherited disorder in which white blood cells lose
their ability to destroy certain bacteria and fungi.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Description
CGD is an X-linked genetic disease, meaning the
defective gene is carried on the X chromosome (one of
the sex chromosomes). Females have two copies of the
X chromosome, whereas males have one X and one Y.
CGD also is a recessive defect meaning that both copies
of the chromosome must have the defect before it can
be expressed. Females who have one X chromosome
without the defect do not get this disease. Males, since
they only have one X chromosome, get the disease if the
defect is present. Thus, CGD affects mostly males.
CGD is an immunodeficiency disorder. Patients
with immunodeficiency disorders suffer frequent
infections. This happens because part of their immune
system isn’t working properly and the infectious
microorganisms are not killed as rapidly as is normal.
In CGD there is a defect in the ability of the white
blood cells to kill bacteria and fungi. The white blood
cells affected are phagocytic cells. They are part of the
non-specific immune system and move via the blood to
all parts of the body where they ingest and destroy
microbes. Phagocytic cells are the first line of defense
against microorganisms. In this disease, the decreased
ability to kill microbes that they have ingested leads to
a failure to effectively combat infectious diseases.
Patients with CGD are subject to certain types of
recurring infection, especially those of the skin,
lungs, mouth, nose, intestines, and lymph nodes.
With the exception of the lymph nodes, all of these
areas are considered external tissues that come into
contact with microorganisms from the environment.
The lymph system drains all areas of the body to
eliminate destroyed microorganisms and to assist the
immune system in attacking microorganisms.
Infections occur in the lymph nodes as a consequence
of the normal draining function.

Causes and symptoms
The genetic defect that causes CGD reduces the
amount of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide that
white blood cells can make. These chemicals are
important for killing bacteria and fungi. Without
them the white blood cells ingest the microorganisms,
but cannot kill them. In some cases, the microbes then
replicate inside the white blood cell eventually causing
its death.
Symptoms of the disease usually appear by age
two. Frequent, recurrent infections of the skin, lungs
(e.g. pneumonia), mouth (e.g. gingivitis), nose, intestines and lymph nodes are a hallmark of this disease.
Patients may also develop multiple, recurrent liver
abscesses and bone infections (osteomyelitis).

techniques such as biofeedback, meditation, acupuncture, and yoga may help people with sleep disturbances
relax and get more rest. They also help some people
reduce depression and anxiety caused by CFS.

Phagocytic cells—A cell that ingests microorganisms and foreign particles.

John T. Lohr, PhD

I Chronic kidney failure
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made based on the observation of a
pattern of recurrent infections. Blood tests of lymphocyte and antibody functions will be normal. Tests of
phagocytic cells will show normal ingestion, but a
greatly decreased ability to kill bacteria.

Definition
Chronic kidney failure occurs when disease or
disorder damages the kidneys so that they are no
longer capable of adequately removing fluids and
wastes from the body or of maintaining the proper
level of certain kidney-regulated chemicals in the
bloodstream.

Treatment
Early, aggressive treatment of all infections is critical to the successful management of CGD. Patients
are treated with antibiotics and immune serum.
Antibiotics are used at the first sign of infection.
Immune serum is a source of antibodies that help
fight infections. Interferon gamma is an experimental
treatment for CGD that has shown promising results.
There is no cure for the underlying cause of chronic
granulomatous disease

Prognosis
Although antibiotics can treat most infections and
may help prevent others, premature death may result,
typically due to repeated lung infections.

Description
Chronic kidney failure, also known as chronic
renal failure, affects over 250,000 Americans annually.
It is caused by a number of diseases and inherited
disorders, but the progression of chronic kidney failure is always the same. The kidneys, which serve as the
body’s natural filtration system, gradually lose their
ability to remove fluids and waste products (urea)
from the bloodstream. They also fail to regulate certain chemicals in the bloodstream, and deposit protein
into the urine. Chronic kidney failure is irreversible,
and will eventually lead to total kidney failure, also
known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Without
proper treatment intervention to remove wastes and
fluids from the bloodstream, ESRD is fatal.

Causes and symptoms

Prevention
Since CGD is a hereditary disorder, it cannot
currently be prevented. Patients and their families
may benefit from genetic counseling. Preventive (prophylactic) antibiotics may help keep some infections
from occurring, and good hygiene, especially rigorous skin and mouth care, can help prevent infections
in these areas. Avoiding crowds or other people
who have infections are also effective preventive
measures.

Kidney failure is triggered by disease or a hereditary disorder in the kidneys. Both kidneys are typically
affected. The four most common causes of chronic
kidney failure include:


Diabetes. Diabetes mellitus (DM), both insulin
dependant (IDDM) and non-insulin dependant
(NIDDM), occurs when the body cannot produce
and/or use insulin, the hormone necessary for the
body to process glucose. Long-term diabetes may
cause the glomeruli, the filtering units located in the
nephrons of the kidneys, to gradually lose
functioning.



Glomerulonephritis. Glomerulonephritis is a chronic
inflammation of the glomeruli, or filtering units of
the kidney. Certain types of glomerulonephritis are





Headaches. High blood pressure may trigger
headaches.

Hypertension. High blood pressure is unique in that it
is both a cause and a major symptom of kidney failure. The kidneys can become stressed and ultimately
sustain permanent damage from blood pushing
through them at an excessive level of pressure over
a long period of time.



Hypertension, or high blood pressure. The retention
of fluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase,
which in turn, causes blood pressure to rise.



Increased fatigue. Toxic substances in the blood and
the presence of anemia may cause feelings of
exhaustion.



Itching. Phosphorus, which is typically eliminated in
the urine, accumulates in the blood of patients with
kidney failure. This heightened phosphorus level
may cause itching of the skin.



Lower back pain. Pain where the kidneys are located,
in the small of the back below the ribs.



Nausea, loss of appetite, and vomiting. Urea in the
gastric juices may cause upset stomach. This can lead
to malnutrition and weight loss.

Polycystic kidney disease. Polycystic kidney disease is
an inherited disorder that causes cysts to be formed
on the nephrons, or functioning units, of the kidneys.
The cysts hamper the regular functioning of the
kidney.

Other possible causes of chronic kidney failure
include kidney cancer, obstructions such as kidney
stones, pyelonephritis, reflux nephropathy, systemic
lupus erythematosus, amyloidosis, sickle cell anemia,
Alport syndrome, and oxalosis.
Initially, symptoms of chronic kidney failure
develop slowly. Even individuals with mild to moderate kidney failure may show few symtpoms in spite of
increased urea in their blood. Among the symptoms
that may be present at this point are frequent urination
during the night and high blood pressure.
Most symptoms of chronic kidney failure are not
apparent until kidney disease has progressed significantly. Common symptoms include:


Anemia. The kidneys are responsible for the production of erythropoietin (EPO), a hormone which stimulates red cell production. If kidney disease causes
shrinking of the kidney, this red blood cell production is hampered.



Bad breath or a bad taste in mouth. Urea, or waste
products, in the saliva may cause an ammonia-like
taste in the mouth.



Bone and joint problems. The kidneys produce vitamin D, which aids in the absorption of calcium and
keeps bones strong. For patients with kidney failure,
bones may become brittle, and in the case of children,
normal growth may be stunted. Joint pain may also
occur as a result of unchecked phosphate levels in the
blood.



Edema. Puffiness or swelling around the eyes, arms,
hands, and feet.



Frequent urination.



Foamy or bloody urine. Protein in the urine may
cause it to foam significantly. Blood in the urine
may indicate bleeding from diseased or obstructed
kidneys, bladder, or ureters.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis
Kidney failure is typically diagnosed and treated
by a nephrologist, a doctor that specializes in treating
the kidneys. The patient that is suspected of having
chronic kidney failure will undergo an extensive blood
work-up. A blood test will assess the levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid, phosphate, sodium, and potassium in the blood. Urine
samples will also be collected, usually over a 24-hour
period, to assess protein loss.
Uncovering the cause of kidney failure is critical to
proper treatment. A full assessment of the kidneys is
necessary to determine if the underlying disease is treatable and if the kidney failure is chronic or acute. An
x ray, MRI, computed tomography scan, ultrasound,
renal biopsy, and/or arteriogram of the kidneys may be
employed to determine the cause of kidney failure and
level of remaining kidney function. X rays and ultrasound of the bladder and/or ureters may also be taken.

Treatment
Chronic kidney failure is an irreversible condition.
Hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplantation must be employed to replace the lost function of
the kidneys. In addition, dietary changes and treatment
to relieve specific symptoms such as anemia and high
blood pressure are critical to the treatment process.
Hemodialysis
Hemodialysis is the most frequently prescribed
type of dialysis treatment in the United States. Most

Chronic kidney failure

hemodialysis patients require treatment three times a
week, for an average of three to four hours per dialysis
‘‘run’’ depending on the type of dialyzer used and their
current physical condition. The treatment involves
circulating the patient’s blood outside of the body
through an extracorporeal circuit (ECC), or dialysis
circuit. The dialysis circuit consists of plastic blood
tubing, a two-compartment filter known as a dialyzer,
or artificial kidney, and a dialysis machine that monitors and maintains blood flow and administers dialysate, a chemical bath used to draw waste products out
of the blood. The patient’s blood leaves and enters the
body through two needles inserted into the patient’s
vein, called an access site, and is pushed through the
blood compartment of the dialyzer. Once inside of the
dialyzer, excess fluids and toxins are pulled out of
the bloodstream and into the dialysate compartment,
where they are carried out of the body. At the same
time, electrolytes and other chemicals in the dialysate
solution move from the dialysate into the bloodstream. The purified, chemically-balanced blood is
then returned to the body.
Peritoneal dialysis
In peritoneal dialysis (PD), the patient’s peritoneum, or lining of the abdomen, acts as a blood filter.
A catheter is surgically inserted into the patient’s
abdomen. During treatment, the catheter is used to
fill the abdominal cavity with dialysate. Waste products and excess fluids move from the patient’s bloodstream into the dialysate solution. After a waiting
period of six to 24 hours, depending on the treatment
method used, the waste-filled dialysate is drained from
the abdomen, and replaced with clean dialysate.
There are three types of peritoneal dialysis, which
vary by treatment time and administration method:
Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD),
Continuous Cyclic Peritoneal Dialysis (CCPD), and
Intermittent Peritoneal Dialysis (IPD).
Kidney transplantation
Kidney transplantation involves surgically attaching a functioning kidney, or graft, from a brain dead
organ donor (a cadaver transplant), or from a living
donor, to a patient with ESRD. Patients with chronic
renal disease who need a transplant and don’t have a
living donor register with UNOS (United Network for
Organ Sharing), the federal organ procurement
agency, to be placed on a waiting list for a cadaver
kidney transplant. Kidney availability is based on the
patient’s health status. When the new kidney is transplanted, the patient’s existing, diseased kidneys may or
may not be removed, depending on the circumstances
890

KEY TERMS
End-stage renal disease (ESRD)—Total kidney failure; chronic kidney failure is diagnosed as ESRD
when kidney function falls to 5-10% of capacity.
Nephrotic syndrome—Characterized by protein
loss in the urine, low protein levels in the blood,
and fluid retention.
Ureters—The two ducts that pass urine from each
kidney to the bladder.

surrounding the kidney failure. A regimen of immunosuppressive, or anti-rejection medication, is required
after transplantation surgery.
Dietary management
A diet low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorous, three substances that the kidneys regulate, is critical in managing kidney disease. Other dietary
restrictions, such as a reduction in protein, may be
prescribed depending on the cause of kidney failure
and the type of dialysis treatment employed. Patients
with chronic kidney failure also need to limit their
fluid intake.
Medications and dietary supplements
Kidney failure patients with hypertension typically take medication to control their high blood pressure. Epoetin alfa, or EPO (Epogen), a hormone
therapy, and intravenous or oral iron supplements
are used to manage anemia. A multivitamin may be
prescribed to replace vitamins lost during dialysis
treatments. Vitamin D, which promotes the absorption of calcium, along with calcium supplements, may
also be prescribed.
Since 1973, Medicare has picked up 80% of
ESRD treatment costs, including the costs of dialysis
and transplantation and of some medications. To qualify for benefits, a patient must be insured or eligible
for benefits under Social Security, or be a spouse or
child of an eligible American. Private insurance and
state Medicaid programs often cover the remaining
20% of treatment costs.

Prognosis
Early diagnosis and treatment of kidney failure is
critical to improving length and quality of life in
chronic kidney failure patients. Patient outcome varies
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

The demand for kidneys to transplant continues
to exceed supply. In 1996, over 34,000 Americans were
on the UNOS waiting list for a kidney transplant, but
only 11,330 living donor and cadaver transplants were
actually performed. Cadaver kidney transplants have
a 50% chance of functioning nine years, and living
donor kidneys that have two matching antigen pairs
have a 50% chance of functioning for 24 years.
However, some transplant grafts have functioned for
over 30 years.

disease
Definition
Chronic obstructive lung disease, also known as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is a
general term for a group of conditions in which there is
persistent difficulty in expelling (or exhaling) air from
the lungs. COPD commonly refers to two related,
progressive diseases of the respiratory system, chronic
bronchitis and emphysema. Because smoking is the
major cause of both diseases, chronic bronchitis and
emphysema often occur together in the same patient.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Description
COPD is one of the fastest-growing health problems. Nearly 16 million people in the United States,
14 million with chronic bronchitis and two million with
emphysema, suffer from COPD. COPD is responsible
for more than 96,000 deaths annually, making it the
fourth leading cause of death. Although COPD is more
common in men than women, the increase in incidence
of smoking among women since World War II has
produced an increase in deaths from COPD in
women. COPD has a large economic impact on the
healthcare system and a destructive impact on the
lives of patients and their families. Quality of life for a
person with COPD decreases as the disease progresses.
Chronic bronchitis
In chronic bronchitis, chronic inflammation
caused by cigarette smoking results in a narrowing of
the openings in the bronchi, the large air tubes of the
respiratory system, and interferes with the flow of air.
Inflammation also causes the glands that line the
bronchi to produce excessive amounts of mucus,
further narrowing the airways and blocking airflow.
The result is often a chronic cough that produces sputum (mainly mucus) and shortness of breath. Cigarette
smoke also damages the cilia, small hair-like projections that move bacteria and foreign particles out of
the lungs, increasing the risk of infections.
Emphysema
Emphysema is a disease in which cigarette smoke
causes an overproduction of the enzyme elastase, one
of the immune system’s infection-fighting biochemicals. This results in irreversible destruction of a protein in the lung called elastin which is important for
maintaining the structure of the walls of the alveoli,
the terminal small air sacs of the respiratory system.
As the walls of the alveoli rupture, the number of
alveoli is reduced and many of those remaining are
enlarged, making the lungs of the patient with emphysema less elastic and overinflated. Due to the higher
pressure inside the chest that must be developed to
force air out of the less-elastic lungs, the bronchioles,
small air tubes of the respiratory system, tend to collapse during exhalation. Stale air gets trapped in the
air sacs and fresh air cannot be brought in.

Causes and symptoms
There are several important risk factors for COPD:


Lifestyle. Cigarette smoking is by far the most important risk factor for COPD (80% of all cases). Cigar
891

Chronic obstructive lung disease

by the cause of chronic kidney failure and the method
chosen to treat it. Overall, patients with chronic kidney disease leading to ESRD have a shortened lifespan. According to the United States Renal Data
System (USRDS), the lifespan of an ESRD patient is
18–47% of the lifespan of the age-sex-race matched
general population. ESRD patients on dialysis have a
lifespan that is 16–37% of the general population.

Chronic obstructive lung disease

and pipe smoking can also cause COPD. Air pollution and industrial dusts and fumes are other important risk factors.


Age. Chronic bronchitis is more common in people
over 40 years old; emphysema occurs more often in
people 65 years of age and older.



Socioeconomic class. COPD-related deaths are
about twice as high among unskilled and semi-skilled
laborers as among professionals.



Family clustering. It is thought that heredity predisposes people in certain families to the development of
COPD when other causes, such as smoking and air
pollution, are present.



Lung infections. Lung infections make all forms of
COPD worse.

In the general population, emphysema usually
develops in older individuals with a long smoking history. However, there is also a form of emphysema that
runs in families. People with this type of emphysema
have a hereditary deficiency of a blood component, an
enzyme inhibitor called alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT).
This type of emphysema is sometimes called ‘‘early
onset emphysema’’ because it can appear when a person
is as young as 30 or 40 years old. It is estimated that
there are between 75,000 and 150,000 Americans who
were born with AAT-deficiency. Of this group, emphysema afflicts an estimated 20,000–40,000 people (1–3%
of all cases of emphysema). The risk of developing
emphysema for an AAT-deficient individual who also
smokes is much greater than for others.
The first symptoms of chronic bronchitis are cough
and mucus production. These symptoms resemble a
chest cold that lingers on for weeks. Later, shortness of
breath develops. Cough, sputum production, and shortness of breath may become worse if a person develops a
lung infection. A person with chronic bronchitis may
later develop emphysema as well. In emphysema, shortness of breath on exertion is the predominant early
symptom. Coughing is usually minor and there is little
sputum. As the disease progresses, the shortness of
breath occurs with less exertion, and eventually may
be present even when at rest. At this point, a sputumproducing cough may also occur. Either chronic bronchitis or emphysema may lead to respiratory failure–a
condition in which there occurs a dangerously low level
of oxygen or a serious excess of carbon dioxide in the
blood.

Diagnosis
The first step in diagnosing COPD is a good medical evaluation, including a medical history and a
892

physical examination of the chest using a stethoscope.
In addition, the doctor may request one or more of the
following tests:
Pulmonary function test
Using a spirometer, an instrument that measures
the air taken into and exhaled from the lungs, the
doctor will determine two important values: (1) vital
capacity (VC), the largest amount of air expelled after
the deepest inhalation, and (2) forced expiratory
volume (FEV1), the maximum amount of air expired
in one second. The pulmonary function test can be
performed in the doctor’s office, but is expensive.
Chest x ray
Chest x rays can detect only about half of the cases
of emphysema. Chest x rays are rarely useful for diagnosing chronic bronchitis.
Blood gas levels
Blood may be drawn from an artery (more painful
than drawing blood from a vein) to determine the
amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide present. Low
oxygen and high carbon dioxide levels are often indicative of chronic bronchitis, but not always of
emphysema.
Tests for cause of infection
If infection is present, blood and sputum tests may
be done to determine the cause of infection.
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Many patients with lung disease also develop
heart problems. The ECG identifies signs of heart
disease.

Treatment
The precise nature of the patient’s condition will
determine the type of treatment prescribed for COPD.
With a program of complete respiratory care, disability can be minimized, acute episodes prevented, hospitalizations reduced, and some early deaths avoided.
On the other hand, no treatment has been shown to
slow the progress of the disease, and only oxygen
therapy increases survival rate.
Drugs
Medications frequently prescribed for COPD
patients include:



Bronchodilators. These agents open narrowed airways
and offer significant symptomatic relief for many,
but not all, people with COPD. There are three types
of bronchodilators: Beta2 agonists, anticholinergic
agents, and theophylline and its derivatives.
Depending on the specific drug, a bronchodilator
may be inhaled, injected, or taken orally.



Corticosteroids. Corticosteroids, usually inhaled,
block inflammation and are most useful for patients
with chronic bronchitis with or without emphysema.
Steroids are generally not useful in patients who have
emphysema.



Oxygen replacement. Eventually, patients with low
blood oxygen levels may need to rely on supplemental oxygen from portable or stationary tanks.



Antibiotics. Antibiotics are frequently given at the
first sign of a respiratory infection, such as increased
sputum production or a change in color of sputum
from clear to yellow or green.



Vaccines. To prevent pulmonary infection from
viruses and bacteria, people with COPD should be
vaccinated against influenza each year at least six
weeks before flu season and have a one-time pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccine.



Expectorants. These agents help loosen and expel
mucus secretions from the airways.



Diuretics. These drugs are given to prevent excess
water retention in patients with associated right
heart failure.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



Augmentation therapy (for emphysema due to AATdeficiency only). Replacement AAT (Prolastin),
derived from human blood which has been screened
for viruses, is injected weekly or bimonthly for life.
Surgery

Surgical procedures for emphysema are very rare.
They are expensive and often not covered by insurance. The great majority of patients cannot be helped
by surgery, and no single procedure is ideal for those
who can be helped. In January of 1996, the government temporarily suspended Medicare payments for
lung reduction surgery.


Lung transplantation. Lung transplantation has been
successfully employed in some patients with endstage COPD. In the hands of an experienced team,
the one-year survival rate is over 70%.



Lung volume reduction. These procedures remove
20–30% of severely diseased lung tissue; the remaining parts of the lung are joined together. Mortality
rates can be as high as 15% and complication rates are
even higher. When the operation is successful, patients
report significant improvement in symptoms.
Pulmonary rehabilitation

A structured, outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation
program improves functional capacity in certain
patients with COPD. Services may include general
exercise training, administration of oxygen and nutritional supplements, intermittent mechanical ventilatory

Alternative treatment
For both chronic bronchitis and emphysema,
alternative practitioners recommend diet and nutritional supplements, a variety of herbal medicines,
hydrotherapy, acupressure and acupuncture, aromatherapy, homeopathy, and yoga.

Prognosis
COPD is a disease that can be treated and controlled, but not cured. Survival of patients with COPD
is clearly related to the degree of their lung function
when they are diagnosed and the rate at which they lose
this function. Overall, the median survival is about 10
years for patients with COPD who have lost approximately two-thirds of their lung function at diagnosis.

Prevention
Lifestyle modifications that can help prevent
COPD, or improve function in COPD patients, include:

I Circumcision
Definition
The surgical removal of the foreskin of the penis
or prepuce.

Purpose
In the United States, circumcision in infant boys is
performed for social, medical, or cultural/religious
reasons. Once a routine operation urged by pediatricians and obstetricians for newborns in the middle of
the twentieth century, circumcision has become an
elective option that parents make for their sons on an

individual basis. Families who practice Judaism or
Islam may select to have their sons circumcised as a
religious practice. Others choose circumcision for
medical benefits.
Female circumcision (also known as female genital mutilation) is usually performed for cultural and
social reasons by family members and others who are
not members of the medical profession, with no
anesthesia. Not only is the prepuce removed but
often the vaginal opening is sewn to make it smaller.
This practice is supposed to ensure the virginity of a
bride on her wedding day. It also prevents the woman
from achieving sexual pleasure during coitus. This
practice is not universally approved by the medical
profession and is considered by some as a human
rights violation.
Though the incidence of male circumcision has
decreased from 90% in 1979 to 60% in 1996, it is still
the most common surgical operation in the United
States. Circumcision rates are much lower for the
rest of the industrialized world. In Britain, it is only
done for religious practices or to correct a specific
medical condition of the penis.
Some of the medical reasons parents choose circumcision are to protect against infections of the urinary tract and the foreskin, prevent cancer, lower the
risk of getting sexually transmitted diseases, and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

prevent phimosis (a tightening of the foreskin that
may close the opening of the penis). Though studies
indicate that uncircumcised boys under the age of five
are 20 times more likely than circumcised boys to have
urinary tract infections (UTIs), the rate of incidence of
UTIs is quite low. There are also indications that
circumcised men are less likely to suffer from penile
cancer, inflammation of the penis, or have many sexually transmitted diseases. Here again, the rate of incidence is low. Good hygiene usually prevents most
infections of the penis. Phimosis and penile cancer
are very rare, even in men who have not been circumcised. Education and good safe sex practices can prevent sexually transmitted diseases in ways that a
surgical procedure cannot because these are diseases
acquired through risky behaviors.
With these factors in mind, the American Academy
of Pediatrics has issued a policy statement that states
though there is existing scientific evidence that indicates
the medical benefits of circumcision, the benefits are
not strong enough to recommended circumcision as a
routine practice.

Precautions
Circumcision should not be performed on infants
with certain deformities of the penis that may require a
portion of the foreskin for repair. The most common

condition for surgery using the foreskin is hypospadias, a congenital deformity of the penis where the
urinary tract opening is not at the tip of the glans.
Also, infants with a large hydrocoele or hernia may
suffer important complications through circumcision.
Premature infants and infants with serious infections
are also poor candidates to be circumcised, as are
infants with hemophilia, other bleeding disorders, or
whose mothers had taken anticoagulant drugs. In older
boys or men, circumcision is a minor procedure.
Therefore, it can be performed in virtually anyone
without a serious illness or unusual deformity.

Description
The foreskin of the penis protects the sensitivity of
the glans and shields it from irritation by urine, feces,
and foreign materials. It also protects the urinary
opening against infection and incidental injury.
In circumcision of infants, the foreskin is pulled
tightly into a specially designed clamp, and the foreskin pulls away from the broadened tip of the penis.
Pressure from the clamp stops bleeding from blood
vessels that supplied the foreskin. In older boys or
adults, an incision is made around the base of the
foreskin, the foreskin is pulled back, and then it is
cut away from the tip of the penis. Stitches are usually
used to close the skin edges.

Preparation
Despite a long-standing belief that infants do not
experience serious pain from circumcision, most
authorities now believe that some form of local
anesthesia is necessary. The physician injects local
anesthesia at the base of the penis or under the skin
around the penis (subcutaneous ring block). Both
anesthetics block key nerves. EMLA cream, a topical
formula of several anesthetics can also be used.

Hernia—Bulging of abdominal structures through
an abnormal opening in the muscular wall.
Hydrocele—Collection of fluid in the scrotum.
Hypospadias—A congenital deformity of the penis
where the urinary tract opening is not at the tip of

Phimosis—A tightening of the foreskin that may
close the opening of the penis.
Prepuce—A fold like the foreskin that covers the
clitoris; another name for foreskin.

Aftercare
After circumcision, the wound should be washed
daily. An antibiotic ointment or petroleum jelly may
be applied to the site. If there is an incision, a wound
dressing will be present and should be changed each
time the diaper is changed. Sometimes a plastic ring is
used instead of a bandage. The ring will usually fall off
in five to eight days. The penis will heal in seven to 10
days.
Infants who undergo circumcision may be fussy
for some hours afterward, so parents should be prepared for crying, feeding problems, and sleep problems. Generally these go away within a day. In
older boys, the penis may be painful, but this will go
away gradually. A topical anesthetic ointment or
spray may be used to relieve this temporary discomfort. There may also be a ‘‘bruise’’ on the penis, which
typically goes away with no particular attention.

Risks
Complications following newborn circumcision
appear in one out of every 500 procedures. Most complications are minor. Bleeding occurs in half of
the complications and is usually easy to control.
Infections are rare and present with fever and signs
of inflammation.
There may be injuries to the penis itself, and these
may be difficult to repair. In 2000, there were reports
that the surgical clamps used in circumcision were at
fault in over 100 injuries reported between July 1996

Cirrhosis is the seventh leading cause of diseaserelated death in the United States. It is the third most
common cause of death in adults between the ages of
45 and 65. It is twice as common in men as in women.
The disease occurs in more than half of all malnourished chronic alcoholics, and kills about 25,000 people
a year. In Asia and Africa, however, most deaths from
cirrhosis are due to chronic hepatitis B.

I Cirrhosis
Definition
Cirrhosis is a chronic degenerative disease in
which normal liver cells are damaged and are then
replaced by scar tissue.

Description
Cirrhosis changes the structure of the liver and the
blood vessels that nourish it. The disease reduces the
liver’s ability to manufacture proteins and process
hormones, nutrients, medications, and poisons.
Cirrhosis gets worse over time and can become
potentially life threatening. This disease can cause:


excessive bleeding (hemorrhage)



impotence



liver cancer



coma due to accumulated ammonia and body wastes
(liver failure)



sepsis (blood poisoning)



death

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Types of cirrhosis
Portal or nutritional cirrhosis is the form of
the disease most common in the United States.
About 30–50% of all cases of cirrhosis are this type.
Nine out of every 10 people who have nutritional
cirrhosis have a history of alcoholism. Portal or nutritional cirrhosis is also called Laënnec’s cirrhosis.
Biliary cirrhosis is caused by intrahepatic bileduct diseases that impede bile flow. Bile is formed in
the liver and is carried by ducts to the intestines. Bile
then helps digest fats in the intestines. Biliary cirrhosis
can scar or block these ducts. It represents 15–20% of
all cirrhosis.
Various types of chronic hepatitis, especially
hepatitis B and hepatitis C, can cause postnecrotic
cirrhosis. This form of the disease affects up to 40%
of all patients who have cirrhosis.
Disorders like the inability to metabolize iron and
similar disorders may cause pigment cirrhosis (hemochromatosis), which accounts for 5–10% of all instances
of the disease.

Causes and symptoms
Long-term alcoholism is the primary cause of
cirrhosis in the United States. Men and women
respond differently to alcohol. Although most men
can safely consume two to five drinks a day, one or
two drinks a day can cause liver damage in women.
Individual tolerance to alcohol varies, but people who
drink more and drink more often have a higher risk of
developing cirrhosis. In some people, one drink a day
can cause liver scarring.
Chronic liver infections, such as hepatitis B and
particularly hepatitis C, are commonly linked to cirrhosis. People at high risk of contracting hepatitis B
include those exposed to the virus through contact
with blood and body fluids. This includes healthcare
workers and intravenous (IV) drug users. In the past,
people have contracted hepatitis C through blood
transfusions. As of 2003, cirrhosis resulting from
chronic hepatitis has emerged as a leading cause of
death among HIV-positive patients; in Europe, about

and January 2000. In nearly all cases, the clamps were
assumed to be in working order but had been repaired
with replacement parts that were not of the manufacturer’s specifications. Physicians were urged to inspect
the clamps before use and ensure that their dimensions
fit their infant patients.

Cirrhosis

30% of HIV-positive patients are coinfected with a
hepatitis virus.
Liver injury, reactions to prescription medications, exposure to toxic substances, and repeated episodes of heart failure with liver congestion can cause
cirrhosis. The disorder can also be a result of diseases
that run in families (inherited diseases) like:


a lack of a specific liver enzyme (alpha1-antitrypsin
deficiency)



the absence of a milk-digesting enzyme (galactosemia)



an inability to convert sugars to energy (glycogen
storage disease)



an absorption deficit in which excess iron is deposited in the liver, pancreas, heart, and other organs
(hemochromatosis)



a disorder characterized by accumulations of copper
in the liver, brain, kidneys, and corneas (Wilson’s
disease)

Obesity has recently been recognized as a risk
factor in nonalcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Some
surgeons are recommending as of 2003 that patients
scheduled for weight-reduction surgery have a liver
biopsy to evaluate the possibility of liver damage.
Poor nutrition increases a person’s risk of developing cirrhosis. In about 10 out of every 100 patients,
the cause of cirrhosis cannot be determined. Many
people who have cirrhosis do not have any symptoms
(often called compensated cirrhosis). Their disease is
detected during a routine physical or when tests for an
unrelated medical problem are performed. This type
of cirrhosis can also be detected when complications
occur (decompensated cirrhosis).
Symptoms of cirrhosis are usually caused by the
loss of functioning liver cells or organ swelling due to
scarring. The liver enlarges during the early stages of
illness. The palms of the hands turn red and patients
may experience:


constipation



diarrhea



dull abdominal pain



fatigue



indigestion



loss of appetite



nausea



vomiting



weakness



weight loss

898

As the disease progresses, the spleen enlarges and
fluid collects in the abdomen (ascites) and legs
(edema). Spider-like blood vessels appear on the
chest and shoulders, and bruising becomes common.
Men sometimes lose chest hair. Their breasts may
grow and their testicles may shrink. Women may
have menstrual irregularities.
Cirrhosis can cause extremely dry skin and intense
itching. The whites of the eyes and the skin may turn
yellow (jaundice), and urine may be dark yellow or
brown. Stools may be black or bloody. Sometimes
the patient develops persistent high blood pressure
due to the scarring (portal hypertension). This type of
hypertension can be life threatening. It can cause veins
to enlarge in the stomach and in the tube leading from
the mouth to the stomach (esophagus). These enlarged
veins are called varices, and they can rupture and bleed
massively.
Other symptoms of cirrhosis include:


anemia



bleeding gums



decreased interest in sex



fever



fluid in the lungs



hallucinations



lethargy



lightheadedness



muscle weakness



musty breath



painful nerve inflammation (neuritis)



slurred speech



tremors

If the liver loses its ability to remove toxins from
the brain, the patient may have additional symptoms.
The patient may become forgetful and unresponsive,
neglect personal care, have trouble concentrating, and
acquire new sleeping habits. These symptoms are
related to ammonia intoxication and the failure of
the liver to convert ammonia to urea. High protein
intake in these patients can also lead to these
symptoms.

Diagnosis
A patient’s medical history can reveal illnesses or
lifestyles likely to lead to cirrhosis. Liver changes can
be seen during a physical examination. A doctor who
suspects cirrhosis may order blood and urine tests to

measure liver function. Because only a small number
of healthy cells are needed to carry out essential liver
functions, test results may be normal even when cirrhosis is present.
Computed tomography scans (CT), ultrasound,
and other imaging techniques can be used during diagnosis. They can help determine the size of the liver,
indicate healthy and scarred areas of the organ, and
detect gallstones. Cirrhosis is sometimes diagnosed
during surgery or by examining the liver with a laparoscope. This viewing device is inserted into the patient’s
body through a tiny incision in the abdomen.
Liver biopsy is usually needed to confirm a diagnosis of cirrhosis. In this procedure, a tissue sample is
removed from the liver and is examined under a microscope in order to learn more about the organ.
A newer and less invasive test involves the measurement of hyaluronic acid in the patient’s blood
serum. As of 2003, however, the serum hyaluronic
acid test is most useful in monitoring the progress of
liver disease; it is unlikely to completely replace liver
biopsy in the diagnosis of cirrhosis.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment
The goal of treatment is to cure or reduce the
condition causing cirrhosis, prevent or delay disease
progression, and prevent or treat complications.
Salt and fluid intake are often limited, and activity
is encouraged. A diet high in calories and moderately
high in protein can benefit some patients. Tube feedings or vitamin supplements may be prescribed if the
liver continues to deteriorate. Patients are asked not to
consume alcohol.
Medication
Iron supplements, diuretics, and antibiotics may be
used for anemia, fluid retention, and ammonia accumulation associated with cirrhosis. Vasoconstrictors
are sometimes needed to stop internal bleeding and
antiemetics may be prescribed to control nausea.
Laxatives help the body absorb toxins and accelerate their removal from the digestive tract. Beta blockers may be prescribed to control cirrhosis-induced
portal hypertension. Because the diseased liver can no

longer efficiently neutralize harmful substances, medications must be given with caution. Interferon medicines may be used by patients with chronic hepatitis B
and hepatitis C to prevent post-hepatic cirrhosis.



shows signs of infection (redness, swelling, tenderness, pain)

Alternative treatment

Surgery
Medication that causes scarring can be injected
directly into veins to control bleeding from varices in
the stomach or esophagus. Varices may require a special surgical procedure called balloon tamponade ligation to stop the bleeding. Surgery may be required to
repair disease-related throat damage. It is sometimes
necessary to remove diseased portions of the spleen
and other organs.
Liver transplants can benefit patients with
advanced cirrhosis. However, the new liver will eventually become diseased unless the underlying cause of
cirrhosis is removed. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis
must demonstrate a willingness to stop drinking before
being considered suitable transplant candidates.
The incidence of liver cancer related to cirrhosis in
the United States has increased 75% since the early
1990s. Partial surgical removal of the liver in patients
with early-stage cancer of the liver appears to be as
successful as transplantation, in terms of the 5-year
survival rate.
Supportive measures

Alternative treatments for cirrhosis are aimed at
promoting the function of healthy liver cells and
relieving the symptoms associated with the disease.
Several herbal remedies may be helpful to cirrhosis
patients. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and rockpoppy (Chelidonium majus) may help improve the efficiency of liver cells. Milk thistle extract (Silybum marianum) may slow disease progression and significantly
improve survival rates in alcoholics and other cirrhosis
patients. Practitioners of homeopathy and traditional
Chinese medicine can also prescribe treatments that
support healthy liver function.

Prognosis
Cirrhosis-related liver damage cannot be reversed,
but further damage can be prevented by patients who:

A balanced diet promotes regeneration of healthy
liver cells. Eating five or six small meals throughout the
day should prevent the sick or bloated feeling patients
with cirrhosis often have after eating. Alcohol and
caffeine, which destroy liver cells, should be avoided.
So should any foods that upset the stomach. Patients
with brain disease associated with cirrhosis should
avoid excessive amounts of protein in the diet.

If the underlying cause of cirrhosis cannot be
corrected or removed, scarring will continue. The
liver will fail, and the patient will probably die within
five years. Patients who stop drinking after being diagnosed with cirrhosis can increase their likelihood of
living more than a few years from 40% to 60–70%.

A patient can keep a food diary that describes
what was eaten, when it was eaten, and how the
patient felt afterwards. This diary can be useful in
identifying foods that are hard to digest and in scheduling meals to coincide with the times the patient is
most hungry.

Eliminating alcohol abuse could prevent 75–80%
of all cases of cirrhosis.

Patients who have cirrhosis should weigh themselves every day and notify their doctor of a sudden
gain of five pounds or more. A doctor should also be
notified if symptoms of cirrhosis appear in anyone
who has not been diagnosed with the disease. A doctor
should also be notified if a patient diagnosed with
cirrhosis:

I Cleft lip and palate
Definition
A cleft is a birth defect that occurs when the
tissues of the lip and/or palate of the fetus do not
fuse very early in pregnancy. A cleft lip, sometimes
referred to as a harelip, is an opening in the upper lip
that can extend into the base of the nostril. A cleft
palate is an opening in the roof of the mouth.

Description
Babies born with cleft lips will have an opening
involving the upper lip. The length of the opening
ranges from a small notch, to a cleft that extends into
the base of the nostril. Cleft lips may involve one or
both sides of the lip.
Babies born with cleft palates have openings in the
palate, which is the roof of the mouth. The size and
position of the opening varies. The cleft may be only in
the hard palate, the bony portion of the roof of the
mouth, opening into the floor of the nose. It may be
only in the soft palate, the soft portion of the roof of
the mouth. The cleft palate may involve both the hard
and soft palate and may occur on both sides of the
center of the palate.
901

Cleft lip and palate



Cleft lip and palate

Babies may have cleft lips with or without cleft
palates. Cleft palates may also occur without cleft lips.
The incidence of cleft lip and palate not associated
with a syndrome is one in 700 newborns. Native
Americans have an incidence of 3.6 in 1,000 newborns.
The incidence among Japanese newborns is 2.1 in
1,000. The incidence among whites is one in 1,000
newborns. African Americans have an incidence of
0.3 in 1,000 newborns.

Causes and symptoms
Cleft lips and palates not associated with a syndrome are caused by a combination of genetic and
environmental factors. Inheritance caused by such a
combination is called multifactorial. The embryo
inherits genes that increase the risk for cleft lip and/
or palate. When an embryo with such genes is exposed
to certain environmental factors the embryo develops
a cleft.
The risk of a baby being born with a cleft lip or
palate increases with the number of affected relatives
and the number of relatives that have more severe
clefts.
Environmental factors that increase the risk of
cleft lip and palate include cigarette and alcohol use
during pregnancy. Some drugs, such as phenytoin,
sodium valproate, and methotrexate, also increase
the incidence of clefting. The pregnant mother’s nutrition may affect the incidence of clefting as well.
Babies born with a cleft lip will be seen to have an
elongated opening in the upper lip. The size of this
opening may range from a small notch in the upper lip
to an opening that extends into the base of the nostril.
The cleft lip may be below the right or left nostril or
below both nostrils.
Babies born with a cleft palate will be seen to have
an opening into the roof of the mouth. The size and
position of the cleft varies and it may involve only the
hard palate, or only the soft palate and may occur on
both sides of the center of the palate.
In some cases the cleft palate will be covered with
the normal lining of the mouth and can only be felt by
the examiner.
Babies with cleft lips and palates have feeding
difficulties, which are more severe in babies with cleft
palates. The difficulty in feeding is due to the baby
being unable to achieve complete suction. In the case
of clefts of the hard palate, liquids enter the nose from
the mouth through the opening in the hard palate.
902

A cleft palate also affects a child’s speech, since
the palate is necessary for speech formation. The
child’s speech pattern may still be affected despite
surgical repair.
Ear infections are more common in babies born
with cleft palates. The infections occur because the
muscles of the palate do not open the Eustachian
tubes that drain the middle ear. This allows fluid to
collect and increases the risk of infection and hearing
loss.
Teeth may also erupt misaligned.

Diagnosis
Cleft lip and palate can be diagnosed before birth
by ultrasound. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
offers more accuracy for detecting cleft lip and palate,
as it is a more detailed imaging method. It is particularly helpful in showing soft palate defects. In 2004,
researchers reported discovery of a gene test for isolated cleft lip and cleft palate to help predict if parents
who have one child with the isolated form of cleft lip or
palate were likely to have a second child with the same
defect. After birth, cleft lip and palate are diagnosed
by physical exam.

Treatment
If cleft lip and/or palate are diagnosed by ultrasound before birth, further testing may be required to
diagnose associated abnormalities if present. Referral
to a cleft team is essential. A cleft team consists of
specialists in the management of babies with clefts and
includes surgeons as well as nurses and speech therapists. Members of the team inform the parents of all
aspects of management. Feeding methods are also
discussed, since feeding is the first problem that must
be dealt with. It may be possible to breastfeed a baby
born with only a cleft lip, but babies born with cleft
palates usually have more problems with feeding and
frequently require special bottles and teats. A palatal
obturator is a device that fits into the roof of the
mouth, thus blocking the cleft opening and allowing
easier suckling.
Surgery to repair cleft lips is sometimes performed
after orthodontic treatment to narrow the gap in the
upper lip. The orthodontic treatment can involve
acrylic splints with or without screws or may involve
the use of adhesive tape placed across the gap in the
lip. The orthodontic treatment for cleft lip should be
started within the first three weeks of life and continue
until the cleft lip is repaired.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Babies born with clefts usually require orthodontic treatment between 13 and 18 years of age. They also
require speech therapy.

Prognosis
Babies born with cleft lip and palate have a good
prognosis, and approximately 80% will develop normal speech. There is no known means of preventing
clefting. Good prenatal care is essential and avoiding
harmful substances appear to reduce the risk.

The timing of surgical cleft lip repair depends on
the judgment of the surgeon who will perform the
operation. The procedure is usually performed
between one and three months of age. The goals of
the operation are to close the gap in the upper lip,
place scars in the natural skin curves and to repair
muscle so that the lip appears normal during movement. The closure is done in the three layers (skin,
muscle, and mucosa) that line the inside of the lip. At
the time of the procedure, if the nose is shaped abnormally due to the cleft lip, it is also corrected.
Sometimes further surgery may be needed on the lip
and/or nose to refine the result.
The goals of the surgeon repairing a cleft palate
are normal speech, normal facial growth, and hearing
for the affected infant. The repair of the cleft palate is
usually performed between three and 18 months of
age. The timing may extend beyond this and varies
with the type of cleft palate and center where the
procedure is being performed. Depending of the type
of cleft palate, more than one operation may be
needed to close the cleft and improve speech.
Nonsurgical treatment of a cleft palate is available
for patients who are at high risk for surgery and consists of a prosthetic appliance worn to block the opening in the palate.
Babies born with cleft palates are vulnerable to ear
infections. Their Eustachian tubes do not effectively
drain fluid from the middle ear so fluid accumulates

injuries or fight bites.

happened. The treating physician must maintain a
high level of suspicion and often ask directly.

Treatment
Description
Clenched fist injuries are most common over the
metacarpo phalangeal joint. Their appearance is
deceptive because they do not bleed heavily and the
underlying injury is hidden by soft tissue when the
patient opens his hand and straightens the injured
finger. CFIs can, however, have serious consequences,
including infection, cellulitis, inflammation of the
bone or bone marrow (osteomyelitis), septic arthritis,
and inflammation of the sheaths covering the tendons
of the hand (tenosynovitis). These may lead to permanent loss of function or amputation.
Most CFIs result in tissue injury due to the force
of impact, ragged-edged tears in the skin resulting
from contact with the teeth, and contamination of
the wound by the bacteria in human saliva. As the
patient opens his hand, the skin of the finger is pulled
backward over the deeper part of the wound, thus
sealing bacteria within the injured tissue. This sealing
of the wound by normal motions of the finger is the
reason why clenched fist injuries have the highest rate
of infection of any human bite. The rate of infection of
clenched-fist injuries varies from 15–50%.

Causes and symptoms
The causes of CFIs include fighting and other
forms of aggressive behavior, often combined with
drug or alcohol consumption.
The symptoms of clenched-fist injury include pain
in the affected part of the hand and some stiffness of
the injured finger with limitation of movement. If the
patient has delayed getting medical treatment, there
may be evidence of infection, including swelling, redness, and suppuration (a discharge of pus). The skin
around the wound will be warm to the touch and fever
may be present.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of clenched fist injuries is usually made
on the basis of the location of the injury and x-ray
findings. The most common finding in CFI x rays is
soft tissue swelling, but the x rays may also reveal air
pockets in deep tissues or the joint spaces, fragments
of teeth, fracture lines in the bones, or small loose bone
chips. Diagnosis is often complicated by the fact that
the patient will be reluctant to admit how the injury
904

Treatment of clenched fist injuries is complicated
by several factors. One factor is the anatomical structure of the human hand, which contains many small
closed spaces that make it easy for infection to spread
and persist. Another is the number of disease-causing
bacteria transmitted by human bites; at least 42 different species have been identified. In addition, CFIs
typically do not receive immediate treatment because
the patient is concerned about legal consequences. The
longer the delay, the higher the chances of infection
and permanent damage to the hand. Patients who wait
longer than 24 hours to seek treatment or have signs of
infection or damage to the tendon, joint capsule, or
bones are usually referred immediately to a doctor
who specializes in hand surgery.
The first step in treatment of clenched fist injury is
irrigation, a procedure by which the wound is flushed
with a stream of water under high pressure or with an
antiseptic solution. Incision and drainage of the
wound (I&D) may be required as well as debridement,
the surgical removal of dead tissue and foreign objects
from a wound. Careful examination of the depth of the
wound is essential to proper treatment. The surgeon
may need to enlarge the sides of the wound in order to
make an accurate evaluation. The patient will be asked
to move the affected joint through its full range of
motion so that the surgeon can determine whether
the tendon or joint capsule has been damaged.
Following these procedures, the surgeon will pack
the wound and put the hand in a splint. Bite wounds
are never sutured (sewn shut) because of the possibility
of enclosing bacteria inside the injury. After 24 hours,
the packing will be removed and the hand reexamined
for signs of infection.
If the wound has become infected, the patient is
usually hospitalized and given parenteral (injectable)
antibiotics. The wound is irrigated and examined to
determine the extent of the injury. Cultures are taken
for both aerobic (requiring air or oxygen to live) and
anaerobic (not requiring air or oxygen) species of
bacteria. The cultures should be taken from areas
deep in the wound rather than from the surface for
greater accuracy. Tetanus toxoid should be given if
the patient has not been immunized within the
last 10 years. The patient should also receive treatment and follow-up for the rare possibility of
HIV and hepatitis transmission. Although no welldocumented cases of HIV transmission by human

Infected clenched fist injuries usually contain
several disease-causing bacteria, the most common
being Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus,
Bacteroides sp., Peptostreptococcus sp., and Eikenella

given. Uninfected and relatively superficial CFIs
may be treated with oral penicillin plus dicloxacillin
or Augmentin. For infected CFIs, parenteral penicillin G is usually given together with nafcillin or cefuroxime. CFIs infected by drug-resistant strains of
S. aureus may require treatment with vancomycin.
While some human bite wounds do not require
routine use of antibiotics, a 2004 study confirmed
that puncture wounds, deeper lacerations and bites
to the hand all have high infection rates which may be
lowered by preventive use of antibiotics.

I Club drugs
Definition
Club drugs is the generic term for psychoactive
drugs, usually illegal, that are used by participants of
the rave and dance club and recreational drug
subculture.

Description
The most commonly used club drugs are MDMA
(ecstasy), LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, rohypnol, GHB,

and methamphetamine. These substances are illegal and
strictly controlled. Each drug has different effects and
possible complications.
MDMA, or ecstasy (also XTC, X, or E) is a semisynthetic drug that was patented in 1914 by the Merck
Corporation. The drug was not used for six decades,
until interest in it gathered in the 1970s and 1980s,
stimulated in part by psychologists and therapists who
began experimenting with its possible uses in treating
some psychological conditions including anxiety,
depression, and post traumatic stress syndrome. Users
reported powerfully euphoric or ecstatic effects of the
substance, and use of the drug spread into the recreational drug subculture. Due to health concerns over use
of the drug, it was made a controlled substance in the
1980s, but manufacture and use of the drug has continued. Raves are events in which participants take the
substance and dance to rhythmic, stimulating music.
Some scientists have classified the drug as a hallucinogen, while some psychologists have termed the drug an
empathogen, meaning it increases a sense of empathy
for self and others when used in a controlled environment. MDMA is the most commonly used drug in the
rave and dance club subculture.
MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine)
has stimulating effects in the body, and can create
changed perceptions of time, environment, and tactile
senses. It can cause an increase in body temperature,
heart rate, and blood pressure. In some cases it can
cause unpleasant feelings of anxiety and paranoia. It
works in the body by affecting the serotonin system in
the brain. Serotonin is the neurotransmitter responsible for feelings of well-being and elevated mood.
MDMA causes the brain to be flooded with the neurotransmitter, which creates a feeling of euphoria in
the user. After the effects of the drug wear off, a
temporary decrease in serotonin levels is caused in
the brain, and users may report feelings of mild
depression for days or weeks after ingestion.
MDMA is generally taken in doses of 125 milligrams, although effects are observable by ingestion of
as little as 60 milligrams. It is generally swallowed in
tablets or capsules. Effects begin about one hour after
ingestion, reaching a peak after three or four hours,
and fading after about six hours. Users commonly
ingest a second dose to prolong the effects.
Dangers associated with the drug include
increased body temperature, that may be complicated
by hot environments and physical activities such
as dancing or immersion in hot tubs or saunas.
Dehydration is a common occurrence with the drug.
It can also cause increased heart rate and blood
906

pressure. There is debate in the scientific community
about the effects of the substance on the brain, due to a
lack of human studies. Some animal studies have
shown that MDMA can negatively affect the serotonin system in the brain and damage neurons. Studies
have implied that long-term MDMA users may have
decreased memory function. Other problems associated with the substance arise when the chemical is
adulterated by more dangerous substances such as
methamphetamines and toxic compounds, and mixing
MDMA with other intoxicants including alcohol and
cocaine. MDMA is dangerous for people with heart
disease or high blood pressure, and may increase or
aggravate symptoms in people with psychological
disorders.
LSD (lysergic acid) and psilocybin mushrooms
are psychedelic or hallucinogenic substances. Effects
of these drugs range from euphoria to intense hallucinations and distorted or enhanced perceptions.
Dangers associated with these substances include temporary loss of physical and emotional control and
psychological distress.
Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) is a powerful sedative
that has been termed a ‘‘date rape’’ drug. It can cause
‘‘anterograde amnesia’’ meaning that those taking the
substance may lose memory of events occurring under
its effects. It may be fatal when combined with alcohol
and other depressants.
GHB (gamma hydroxybutyrate) is a substance
with euphoric, depressant, and anabolic (body building) effects in the body. Overdoses can cause seizures
and comas, and the substance can be dangerously
combined with alcohol and other sedatives. It has
also been termed a date rape drug, due to its powerful
sedative effects when combined with alcohol.
Methamphetamine is a dangerously addictive stimulant, known as ‘‘ice’’ and ‘‘crystal’’ among users. It
is taken orally, intranasally (through the nose) and
intravenously. Effects in the body include an intense
rush of euphoric feelings and stimulating effects, followed by an addictive need for more of the substance.
It causes elevated heart rate and increased blood pressure. Research using animals has shown the substance
can cause brain and nervous system damage. It has
also been implicated in causing damage to the blood
vessels in the brain, respiratory problems, irregular
heartbeat, anorexia, and in extreme cases may cause
heart failure and death. Emotional problems associated with use of methamphetamine include addiction, paranoia, anxiety, and insomnia. The use of
methamphetamine has been growing in the United
States throughout the 2000s.

Definition
Clubfoot is a condition in which one or both feet are
twisted into an abnormal position at birth. The condition is also known as talipes or talipes equinovarus.

Description
True clubfoot is characterized by abnormal bone
formation in the foot. There are four variations of
clubfoot, including talipes varus, talipes valgus, talipes
equines, and talipes calcaneus. In talipes varus, the
most common form of clubfoot, the foot generally
turns inward so that the leg and foot look somewhat
like the letter J. In talipes valgus, the foot rotates outward like the letter L. In talipes equinus, the foot
points downward, similar to that of a toe dancer. In
talipes calcaneus, the foot points upward, with the heel
pointing down.
Clubfoot can affect one foot or both. Sometimes
an infant’s feet appear abnormal at birth because of
the intrauterine position of the fetus birth. If there is
no anatomic abnormality of the bone, this is not true
clubfoot, and the problem can usually be corrected
by applying special braces or casts to straighten the
foot.
The ratio of males to females with clubfoot is 2.5
to 1. The incidence of clubfoot varies only slightly. In
the United States, the incidence is approximately 1 in
every 1,000 live births. A 1980 Danish study reported
an overall incidence of 1.20 in every 1,000 children;
by 1994, that number had doubled to 2.41 in every
1,000 live births. No reason was offered for the
increase.

Causes and symptoms
Experts do not agree on the precise cause of clubfoot. The exact genetic mechanism of inheritance has
been extensively investigated using family studies and
other epidemiological methods. No definitive conclusions have been reached as of the early 2000s,
although a Mendelian pattern of inheritance is suspected. This may be due to the interaction of several
different inheritance patterns, different patterns of
development appearing as the same condition, or a
complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. The MSX1 gene has been associated
with clubfoot in animal studies. As of the early 2000s,
however, these findings have not been replicated in
humans.

Clubfoot

A family history of clubfoot has been reported in
24.4% of families in a single study. These findings
suggest the potential role of one or more genes being
responsible for clubfoot.
Several environmental causes have been proposed
for clubfoot. Obstetricians feel that intrauterine crowding causes clubfoot. This theory is supported by a significantly higher incidence of clubfoot among twins
compared to singleton births. Intrauterine exposure to
the drug misoprostol has been linked with clubfoot.
Misoprostol is commonly used when trying, usually
unsuccessfully, to induce abortion in Brazil and in
other countries in South and Central America.
Researchers in Norway have reported that males who
are in the printing trades have significantly more offspring with clubfoot than men in other occupations.
For unknown reasons, amniocentesis, a prenatal test,
has also been associated with clubfoot. One international study published in 2004 reported that amniocentesis done at 13 weeks of gestation was associated
with a fourfold increase in the risk of clubfoot. The
infants of mothers who smoke during pregnancy have
a greater chance of being born with clubfoot than are
offspring of women who do not smoke.
True clubfoot is usually obvious at birth. The four
most common varieties have been described. A clubfoot has a typical appearance of pointing downward
and being twisted inwards. Since the condition starts in
the first trimester of pregnancy, the abnormality is quite
well established at birth, and the foot is often very rigid.
Uncorrected clubfoot in an adult causes only part of the
foot, usually the outer edge, or the heel or the toes, to
touch the ground. For a person with clubfoot, walking
becomes difficult or impossible.

Diagnosis
True clubfoot is usually recognizable and obvious
on physical examination. A routine x ray of the foot that
shows the bones to be malformed or misaligned supplies
a confirmed diagnosis of clubfoot. Ultrasonography is
not always useful in diagnosing the presence of clubfoot
prior to the birth of a child; however, ultrasound is
increasingly used in the early 2000s to evaluate the
severity of clubfoot after birth and monitor its response
to treatment.

Treatment
Most orthopedic surgeons agree that the initial
treatment of congenital (present at birth) clubfoot
should be nonoperative. Nonsurgical treatment should
begin in the first days of life to take advantage of the

favorable fibroelastic properties of the foot’s connective tissues, those forming the ligaments, joint capsules,
and tendons. In a common treatment, a series of casts is
applied over a period of months to reposition the foot
into normal alignment. In mild cases, splinting and
wearing braces at night may correct the abnormality.
Another treatment for clubfoot is the Ilizarov
frame, named for the Russian physician who developed it in 1951. The Ilizarov frame has been used in the
United States and Canada since 1981. It consists of
two metal rings that encircle the leg to be corrected,
wires that attach the rings to the bone, and metal rods
between the rings that can be extended like a telescope.
The frame must be applied by an orthopedic surgeon.
After a week, the surgeon begins to lengthen the rods,
usually at the rate of 1 mm per day. The frame must be
kept in place for several months. Although the Ilizarov
frame is somewhat cumbersome, it has been reported

as giving satisfactory results in straightening clubfeet,
particularly those untreated in infancy.
When clubfoot is severe enough to require surgery,
the condition is usually not completely correctable,
although significant improvement is possible. In the
most severe cases, surgery may be required, especially
when the Achilles tendon, which joins the muscles in the
calf to the bone of the heel, needs to be lengthened.
Because an early operation induces fibrosis, a scarring
and stiffness of the tissue, surgery should be delayed
until an affected child is at least three months old.
Much of a clubfoot abnormality can be corrected
by the use of manipulation and casting during the first
three months of life. Proper manipulative techniques
must be followed by applications of appropriately
molded plaster casts to provide effective and safe correction of most varieties of clubfoot. Long-term care
by an orthopedist is required after initial treatment to
ensure that the correction of the abnormality is maintained. Exercises, corrective shoes, or nighttime splints
may be needed until the child stops growing.

Prognosis
With prompt, expert treatment, clubfoot is
usually correctable. One group of French researchers
found that 77% of the children they followed over a
period of 11 to 18 years had good results from nonsurgical methods of treatment combined with physical
therapy. Most individuals are able to wear regular
shoes and lead active lives. If clubfoot is not appropriately treated, however, the abnormality may
become fixed. This fixation affects the growth of the
child’s leg and foot, and some degree of permanent
disability usually results.

Cluster headache

I Cluster headache

Areas of pain

Definition
Cluster headaches are characterized by an intense
one-sided pain centered by the eye or temple. The pain
lasts for one to two hours on average and may recur
several times in a day.

Nerves

Description
Cluster headaches have been known as histamine
headaches, red migraines, and Horton’s disease,
among others. The constant factor is the pain, which
transcends by far the distress of the more common
tension-type headache or even that of a migraine
headache.
Cluster headaches afflict less than 0.5% of the
population and predominantly affect men; approximately 80% of sufferers are male. Onset typically
occurs in the late 20s, but there is no absolute age
restriction. Approximately 80% of cluster headaches
are classified as episodic; the remaining 20% are
considered chronic. Both display the same symptoms. However, episodic cluster headaches occur
during oneto five-month periods followed by six to
24-month attack-free, or remission, periods. There
is no such reprieve for chronic cluster headache
sufferers.

Causes and symptoms
Biochemical, hormonal, and vascular changes
induce cluster headaches, but why these changes occur
remains unclear. Episodic cluster headaches seem to be
linked to changes in day length, possibly signaling a
connection to the so-called biological clock. Alcohol,
tobacco, histamine, or stress can trigger cluster headaches. Decreased blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia)
can also act as a trigger, particularly during the night
when an individual is sleeping. Interestingly, the triggers do not cause cluster headaches during remission
periods.
The primary cluster headache symptom is excruciating one-sided head pain centered behind an eye or
near the temple. This pain may radiate outward from
the initial focus and encompass the mouth and teeth.
For this reason, some cluster headache sufferers may
mistakenly attribute their pain to a dental problem.
Secondary symptoms, occurring on the same side as
the pain, include eye tearing, nasal congestion followed by a runny nose, pupil contraction, and facial
drooping or flushing.

Secondary symptoms include eye tearing, nasal congestion,
and a runny nose. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)

Diagnosis
Cluster headache symptoms guide the diagnosis.
A medical examination includes recording headache
details, such as frequency and duration, when it
occurs, pain intensity and location, possible triggers,
and any prior symptoms. This history allows other
potential problems to be discounted.

Treatment
Treatment for cluster headaches is composed of
induction, maintenance, and symptomatic therapies.
The first two therapies are prophylactic treatments,
geared toward preventing headaches. Symptomatic
therapy is meant to stop or shorten a headache.
Induction and maintenance therapies begin together.
Induction therapy is intended to break the headache
cycle with drugs such as corticosteroids (for example,
prednisone) or dihydroergotamine. These drugs are
not meant for long-term therapy, but rather as a
jump-start for maintenance therapy. Maintenance
therapy drugs include verapamil, lithium carbonate,
ergotamine, and methysergide. These drugs have longterm effectiveness, but must be taken for at least a
week before a response is observed. With long-term

headaches.

Alternative treatment
Since some cluster headaches are triggered by
stress, stress reduction techniques, such as yoga, meditation, and regular exercise, may be effective. Some
cluster headaches may be an allergic response triggered by food or environmental substances, therefore
identifying and removing the allergen(s) may be key to
resolution of the problem. Histamine is another suspected trigger of cluster headaches, and this response
may be controlled with vitamin C and the bioflavonoids quercetin and bromelain (pineapple enzyme).
Supplementation with essential fatty acids (EFA) will
help decrease any inflammatory response.

of the spine, craniosacral treatment, and massage at

can also be beneficial. Nervous system relaxant
herbs, used singly or in combination, can allow the

I Coagulation disorders
Definition
Coagulation disorders deal with disruption of the
body’s ability to control blood clotting. The most
commonly known coagulation disorder is hemophilia,
a condition in which patients bleed for long periods of
time before clotting. There are other coagulation disorders with a variety of causes.

Description
Coagulation, or clotting, occurs as a complex process involving several components of the blood.
Plasma, the fluid component of the blood, carries a
number of proteins and coagulation factors that regulate bleeding. Platelets, small colorless fragments in
the blood, initiate contraction of damaged blood vessels so that less blood is lost. They also help plug
damaged blood vessels and work with plasma to
911

Coagulation disorders

KEY TERMS

Coagulation disorders

accelerate blood clotting. A disorder affecting platelet
production or one of the many steps in the entire
process can disrupt clotting.
Coagulation disorders arise from different causes
and produce different complications. Some common
coagulation disorders are:


Hemophilia, or hemophilia A (Factor VIII deficiency), an inherited coagulation disorder, affects
about 20,000 Americans. This genetic disorder is
carried by females but most often affects males.



Christmas disease, also known as hemophilia B or
Factor IX deficiency, is less common than hemophilia A with similar in symptoms.



Disseminated intravascular coagulation disorder,
also known as consumption coagulopathy, occurs
as a result of other diseases and conditions. This
disease accelerates clotting, which can actually
cause hemorrhage.



Thrombocytopenia is the most common cause of coagulation disorder. It is characterized by a lack of
circulating platelets in the blood. This disease also
includes idiopathic thrombocytopenia.



Von Willebrand’s disease is a hereditary disorder
with prolonged bleeding time due to a clotting factor
deficiency and impaired platelet function. It is the
most common hereditary coagulation disorder.



Hypoprothrombinemia is a congenital deficiency of
clotting factors that can lead to hemorrhage.



Other coagulation disorders include Factor XI deficiency, also known as hemophilia C, and Factor VII
deficiency. Hemophilia C afflicts one in 100,000 people and is the second most common bleeding disorder
among women. Factor VII is also called serum prothrombin conversion accelerator (SPCA) deficiency.
One in 500,000 people may be afflicted with this
disorder that is often diagnosed in newborns because
of bleeding into the brain as a result of traumatic
delivery.

Causes and symptoms
Some coagulation disorders present symptoms
such as severe bruising. Others will show no apparent
symptoms, but carry the threat of severe internal
bleeding.
Hemophilia
Because of its hereditary nature, hemophilia A
may be suspected before symptoms occur. Some
signs of hemophilia A are numerous large, deep bruises
and pain and swelling of joints caused by internal
912

bleeding. Patients with hemophilia do not bleed faster,
just longer. A person with mild hemophilia may first
discover the disorder with prolonged bleeding following a surgical procedure. If there is bleeding into the
neck, head, or digestive tract, or bleeding from an
injury, emergency measures may be required.
Mild and severe hemophilia A are inherited
through a complex genetic system that passes a recessive gene on the female chromosome. Women usually
do not show signs of hemophilia but are carriers of the
disease. Each male child of the carrier has a 50%
chance of having hemophilia, and each female child
has a 50% chance of passing the gene on.
Christmas disease
Christmas disease, or hemophilia B, is also hereditary but less common than hemophilia A. The
severity of Christmas disease varies from mild to
severe, although mild cases are more common. The
severity depends on the degree of deficiency of the
Factor IX (clotting factor). Hemophilia B symptoms
are similar to those of hemophilia A, including numerous, large and deep bruises and prolonged bleeding.
The more dangerous symptoms are those that represent possible internal bleeding, such as swelling of
joints, or bleeding into internal organs upon trauma.
Hemophilia most often occurs in families with a
known history of the disease, but occasionally, new
cases will occur in families with no apparent history.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation
The name of this disorder arises from the fact that
malfunction of clotting factors cause platelets to clot
in small blood vessels throughout the body. This
action leads to a lack of clotting factors and platelets
at a site of injury that requires clotting. Patients with
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) will
bleed abnormally even though there is no history of
coagulation abnormality. Symptoms may include
minute spots of hemorrhage on the skin, and purple
patches or hematomas caused by bleeding in the skin.
A patient may bleed from surgery or intravenous
injection (IV) sites. Related symptoms include vomiting, seizures, coma, shortness of breath, shock, severe
pain in the back, muscles, abdomen, or chest.
DIC is not a hereditary disorder or a common
one. It is most commonly caused by complications
during pregnancy or delivery, overwhelming infections, acute leukemia, metastatic cancer, extensive
burns and trauma, and even snakebites. There are a
number of other causes of DIC, and it is not commonly understood why or how these various disorders
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia may be acquired or congenital. It represents a defective or decreased production of
platelets. Symptoms include sudden onset of small
spots of hemorrhage on the skin, or bleeding into
mucous membranes (such as nosebleeds). The disorder may also be evident as blood in vomit or stools,
bleeding during surgery, or heavy menstrual flow in
women. Some patients show none of these symptoms,
but complain of fatigue and general weakness. There
are several causes of thrombocytopenia, which is more
commonly acquired as a result of another disorder.
Common underlying disorders include leukemia, drug
toxicity, or aplastic anemia, all of which lead to decreased or defective production of platelets in the bone
marrow. Other diseases may destroy platelets outside
the marrow. These include severe infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and cirrhosis of the
liver. The idiopathic form most commonly occurs in
children, and is most likely the result of production of
antibodies that cause destruction of platelets in the
spleen and to a lesser extent the liver.
Von Willebrand’s disease is caused by a defect in
the Von Willebrand clotting factor, often accompanied
by a deficiency of Factor VIII as well. It is a hereditary
disorder that affects both males and females. In rare
cases, it may be acquired. Symptoms include easy bruising, bleeding in small cuts that stops and starts, abnormal bleeding after surgery, and abnormally heavy
menstrual bleeding. Nosebleeds and blood in the stool
with a black, tarlike appearance are also signs of Von
Willebrand’s disease.

liver. Prothrombin, under the right conditions, is converted to thrombin, which activates fibrin and begins
the process of coagulation. Some patients may show no
symptoms, and others will suffer severe hemorrhaging.
Patients may experience easy bruising, profuse nosebleeds, postpartum hemorrhage, excessively prolonged or
heavy menstrual bleeding, and postsurgical hemorrhage. Hypoprothrombinemia may also be acquired
rather than inherited, and usually results from a
Vitamin K deficiency caused by liver diseases, newborn
hemorrhagic disease, or a number of other factors.
Other coagulation disorders
Factor XI deficiency, or hemophilia C, occurs
more frequently among certain ethnic groups, with
an incidence of about one in 10,000 among
Ashkenazi Jews. Nearly 50% of patients with this
disorder experience no symptoms, but others may
notice blood in their urine, nosebleeds, or bruising.
Although joint bleeding seldom occurs, some factor
XI patients will experience bleeding long after an
injury occurs. Some women will experience prolonged
bleeding after childbirth. Patients with factor VII deficiency vary greatly in their bleeding severity. Women
may experience heavy menstrual bleeding, bleeding
from the gums or nose, bleeding deep within the
skin, and episodes of bleeding into the stomach, intestine, and urinary tract. Factor VII patients may also
suffer bleeding into joints.

Diagnosis
Several blood tests can be used to detect various
coagulation disorders. There are hundreds of different
tests a doctor can order to look for indications of
specific diseases. In addition to blood tests, physicians
will complete a medical history and physical examination. In the case of acquired coagulation disorders,
information such as prior or current diseases and
medications will be important in determining the
cause of the blood disorder.


Hemohilia A will be diagnosed with laboratory tests
detecting presence of clotting factor VIII, factor IX,
and others, as well as the presence or absence of
clotting factor inhibitors.



Christmas disease will be checked against normal
bleeding and clotting time, as well as for abnormal
serum reagents in factor IX deficiency. Other tests of
prothrombin time and thromboplastic generation
may also be ordered.

There is no one test or group of tests that can always
make (or exclude) a diagnosis of DIC. DIC can be

can lead to the coagulation problem. What the underlying causes of DIC have in common is some factor
that affects proteins, platelets, or other clotting factors
and processes. For example, uterine tissue can enter
the mother’s circulation during prolonged labor,
introducing foreign proteins into the blood, or the
venom of some exotic snakes can activate one of the
clotting factors. Severe head trauma can expose blood
to brain tissue. No matter the cause of DIC, the results
are a malfunction of thrombin (an enzyme) and prothrombin (a glycoprotein), which activate the fibrinolytic system, releasing clotting factors in the blood.
DIC can alternate from hemorrhage to thrombosis,
and both can exist, which further complicates diagnosis and treatment.

Coagulation disorders

diagnosed through a number of laboratory tests
which measure concentration of platelets and fibrinogen in the blood with normal counts and prolonged prothrombin time. Other supportive data
include diminished levels of factors V, fibrinogen,
and VIII, decreased hemoglobin, and others. Since
many of the test results also indicate other disorders,
the physician may have to put together several results
to reach a diagnosis of DIC. Serial tests may also be
recommended, because a single examine at one
moment in time may not reveal the process that is
occurring.


Tests for thrombocytopenia include coagulation tests
revealing a decreased platelet count, prolonged bleeding time, and other measurements. If these tests indicate that platelet destruction is causing the disorder,
the physician may order bone marrow examination.



Von Willebrand’s disease will be diagnosed with the
assistance of laboratory tests which show prolonged
bleeding time, absent or reduced levels of factor VIII,
normal platelet count, and others.



Hypothrombinemia is diagnosed with history information and the use of tests that measure vitamin K
deficiency, deficiency of prothrombin, and clotting
factors V, VII, IX, and X.



Factor XI deficiency is diagnosed most often after
injury-related bleeding. Blood tests can help pinpoint
factor VII deficiency.

can be cleaned and bandaged. Parents of hemophiliac children receiving immunizations should inform
the vaccination provider in advance to decrease the
possibility of bleeding problems. These children
should probably not receive injections which go
into the muscle.


Treatment for disseminated intravascular coagulation patients is complicated by the large variety of
underlying causes of the disorder. If at all possible,
the physician will first treat this underlying disorder. If the patient is not already bleeding, this supportive treatment may eliminate the DIC. However,
if bleeding is occurring, the patient may need blood,
platelets, fresh frozen plasma, or other blood products. Heparin has been controversial in treating
DIC, but it is often used as a last resort to stop
hemorrhage. Heparin has not proven useful in treating patients with DIC resulting from heat stroke,
exotic snakebites, trauma, mismatched transfusions, and acute problems resulting from obstetrical
complications.



Secondary acquired thrombocytopenia is best alleviated by treating the underlying cause or disorder.
The specific treatment may depend on the underlying
cause. Sometimes, corticosteroids or immune globulin may be given to improve platelet production.



Von Willebrand’s disease is treated by several methods to reduce bleeding time and to replace factor VIII,
which consequently will replace the Von Willebrand
factor. This may include infusion of cryoprecipitate or
fresh frozen plasma. Desmopressin may also help
raise levels of the Von Willebrand factor.



Hypoprothrombinemia may be treated with concentrates of prothrombin. Vitamin K may also be produced, and in bleeding episodes, the patient may
receive fresh plasma products.



Factor XI (hemophilia C) is most often treated with
plasma, since there are no commercially available
concentrates of factor XI in the United States.
Factor VII patients may be treated with prothrombin complex concentrates. As of early 1998, factor
VII concentrate was not licensed in the United States
and could only be used with special permission.

Treatment
In mild cases, treatment may involve the use of
drugs that stimulate the release of deficient clotting
factors. In severe cases, bleeding may only stop if the
clotting factor that is missing is replaced through infusion of donated human blood in the form of fresh
frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate.


Hemophilia A in mild episodes may require infusion
of a drug called desmopressin or DDAVP. Severe
bleeding episodes will require transfusions of
human blood clotting factors. Hemophiliacs are
encouraged to receive physical therapy to help
damaged joints and to exercise in non-contact sports
such as swimming, bicycle riding, or walking.



Christmas disease patients are treated similarly to
hemophilia A patients. There are commercial products and human blood products available to provide coagulation. Cryoprecipitate was invented in
1965 to replace the need for whole plasma transfusions, which introduced more volume than needed.
By the 1970s, people were able to infuse themselves
with freeze-dried clotting factor. Superficial wounds

Prevention
Prevention of coagulation disorders varies. Acquired
disorders may only be prevented by preventing onset
of the underlying disorder (such as cirrhosis).
Hereditary disorders can be predicted with prenatal
testing and genetic counseling. Prevention of severe
bleeding episodes may be accomplished by refraining
from activities that could cause injury, such as contact
sports. Open communication with healthcare providers prior to procedures or tests that could cause
bleeding may prevent a severe bleeding incident.

Prognosis
The prognosis for patients with mild forms of
coagulation disorders is normally good. Many people
can lead a normal life and maintain a normal life
expectancy. Without treatment of bleeding episodes,
severe muscle and joint pain, and eventually, damage,
can occur. Any incident that causes blood to collect
in the head, neck, or digestive system can be very
serious and requires immediate attention. DIC can
be severe enough to cause clots to form and a stroke

gangrene in the fingers, nose or genitals. The prognosis depends on early intervention and treatment of
the underlying condition. Hemorrhage from a coagulation disorder, particularly into the brain or digestive track, can prove fatal. In the past, patients

I Coarctation of the aorta
Definition
A defect that develops in the fetus in which there is
a narrowing of the aortic arch, the main blood artery
that delivers blood from the left ventricle of the heart to
the rest of the body. Coarctation of the aorta is diagnosed in both newborns and adults. Approximately
10% of newborns with congenital heart disease have
coarctation of the aorta.
915

Coarctation of the aorta

KEY TERMS

Coarctation of the aorta

Description
Blood leaves the heart by way of the left ventricle
and is distributed to the body by arteries. The aortic
arch is the first artery to carry blood as it leaves the
heart. Other arteries to the head and arms branch off
the aortic arch. A narrowing of the aorta at any spot
produces resistance to the flow of blood. This causes
high blood pressure before the narrowing and low
pressure below the narrowing (downstream). Parts of
the body supplied by arteries that branch off the aortic
arch before the narrowing have high blood pressure,
while most of the lower body does not receive enough
blood supply. To compensate for this, the heart works
harder, and the blood pressure rises.
Approximately half of all infants with coarctation
of the aorta are diagnosed within the first two months of
life. Frequently, there are other congenital cardiac complications present. Infants with Turner syndrome have a
45% rate of also having coarctation. There is evidence
that some cases of coarctation may be inherited.

Causes and symptoms
In newborns with congenital heart disease, coarctation of the aorta develops while the baby is in the
womb. Among the consequences of coarctation of the
aorta is ventricular hypertrophy, an enlarging of the
left ventricle in response to the increased back pressure
of the blood and the demand for more blood by the
body. Symptoms in infants include shortness of breath
(dyspnea), difficulty in feeding, and poor weight gain.
Older children usually don’t have symptoms, but may
display fatigue, shortness of breath, or a feeling of
lameness in their legs.

Diagnosis
Infants usually have an abnormal ‘‘gallop’’ heart
rhythm and may also have heart murmurs. Sometimes
excessive arterial pulses can be seen in the carotid and
suprasternal notch arteries, indicating increased pressure in these arteries, while the femoral pulse is weak
or cannot be detected. The systolic pressure is higher in
the arms than in the legs. Enlargement of the heart can
be seen in x rays. Similar symptoms are seen in older
children and adults. A 10 mm Hg (mercury) pressure
difference between the upper and lower extremities is
diagnostic for coarctation of the aorta. For some
patients, the systolic pressure difference is observed
only during exercise. Infants frequently have an
abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) that indicates
that the right or both ventricles are enlarged, while in
older children the ECG may be normal or show that

the left ventricle is enlarged. The coarctation may be
detected in echocardiographic examination.

Treatment
Drugs can be used to treat the hypertension and
heart failure. Surgery is recommended for infants with
other, associated cardiac defects and for those infants
not responding to drug therapy. Surgery is indicated
for infants that don’t require immediate surgery, but
who develop severe hypertension during the first several months of life. Patients are advised to avoid
vigorous exercise prior to surgical correction of the
coarctation. Recoarctation can occur in some
patients, even if they have had surgery.

Prognosis
Approximately half of all infants diagnosed with
coarctation of the aorta have no other cardiac defects
and will respond well to medical management. Most of
these children will eventually outgrow the condition
after several years of life. Although their hypertension
may increase for several months early in life, it will
eventually decrease as the circulatory system develops.
Surgery is required for infants that have severe coarctation of the aorta or have associated cardiac defects.
The average life span of children who have coarctation
of the aorta is 34 years of age. The most common
complications for children who have not had surgery
are hypertension, aortic rupture, intracranial bleeding,
and congestive heart failure. Women who have an
uncorrected coarctation of the aorta have a mortality
rate of 10% during pregnancy and a 90% rate of
complications.

Definition
Cocaine is a highly addictive central nervous system stimulant extracted from the leaves of the coca
plant, Erythroxylon coca.

Description
In its most common form, cocaine is a whitish
crystalline powder that produces feelings of euphoria
when ingested.
Now classified as a Schedule II drug, cocaine has
legitimate medical uses as well as a long history of
recreational abuse. Administered by a licensed physician, the drug can be used as a local anesthetic for
certain eye and ear problems and in some kinds of
surgery.

The drug culture of the 1960s sparked renewed
interest in cocaine. With the advent of crack in the
1980s, use of the drug had once again become a
national problem. Cocaine use declined significantly
during the early 1990s, but it remains a significant
problem and is on the increase in certain geographic
areas and among certain age groups. A mid-1990s government report said that Americans spend more money
on cocaine than on all other illegal drugs combined.

Causes and symptoms
Forms of the drug
In powder form, cocaine is known by such street
names as ‘‘coke,’’ ‘‘blow,’’ ‘‘C,’’ ‘‘flake,’’ ‘‘snow’’ and
‘‘toot.’’ It is most commonly inhaled or ‘‘snorted.’’ It
may also be dissolved in water and injected.
Crack is a smokable form of cocaine that produces an immediate and more intense high. It comes
in off-white chunks or chips called ‘‘rocks.’’ Little
crumbs of crack are sometimes called ‘‘kibbles & bits.’’
In addition to their stand-alone use, both cocaine
and crack are often mixed with other substances.
Cocaine may be mixed with methcathinone (a more
recent drug of abuse, known as ‘‘cat,’’ that is similar to
methamphetamine) to create a ‘‘wildcat.’’ A hollowedout cigar filled with a mixture of crack and marijuana
is known as a ‘‘woolah.’’ And either cocaine or crack
used in conjunction with heroin is called a ‘‘speedball.’’ Cocaine used together with alcohol represents
the most common fatal two-drug combination.
History
Cocaine is one of the oldest known psychoactive
drugs. Coca leaves, the source of cocaine, were used by
the Incas and other inhabitants of the Andean region
of South America for thousands of years, both as a
stimulant and to depress appetite and combat apoxia
(altitude sickness).
Despite the long history of coca leaf use, it was not
until the latter part of the nineteenth century that the
active ingredient of the plant, cocaine hydrochloride,
was first extracted from those leaves. The new drug
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

As with other forms of addiction, cocaine abuse is
the result of a complex combination of internal and
external factors. Genetic predisposition, family history, and immediate environment can affect a person’s
probability of becoming addicted.
As many as three to four million people are estimated to be chronic cocaine users. The 1997 National
Household Survey on Drug Abuse reported an estimated 600,000 current crack users, showing no significant change since the late 1980s.
How cocaine affects the brain
Extensive research has been conducted to determine how cocaine works on the brain and why it is so
addictive. Cocaine has been found to affect an area of
the brain known as the ventral tegmental area (VTA),
which connects with the nucleus accumbens, a major
pleasure center. Like other commonly abused addictive drugs, cocaine’s effects are related to the action
of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which carries
information between neurons. Cocaine interferes
with the normal functioning of neurons by blocking
the re-uptake of dopamine, which builds up in
the synapses and is believed to cause the pleasurable
feelings reported by cocaine users.
Short-term effects of use

soon became a common ingredient in patent medicines
and other popular products (including the original
formula for cola). This widespread use quickly raised
concerns about the drug’s negative effects. In the early
1900s, several legislative steps were taken to address
those concerns; the Harrison Act of 1914 banned the
use of cocaine and other substances in non-prescription
products. In the wake of those actions, cocaine use
declined substantially.

Diagnosis
Diagnosing cocaine addiction can be difficult.
Many of the signs of short-term cocaine use are not
obvious. Since cocaine users often also use other
drugs, it may not be easy to distinguish the effects of
one drug from another.
Cocaine use has been documented in significant
numbers of eighth graders as well as older teens. Over
all age groups, more men than women use the drug.
The highest rate of cocaine use is found among adults
18 to 25 years old.

Cocaine use and pregnancy
The rise in cocaine use as well as the appearance of
crack cocaine in the late 1980s spurred fears about its
effects on the developing fetus and, since then, several
research reports have suggested that prenatal cocaine
use could be associated to a wide range of fetal, newborn, and child development problems. According to
the Lindesmith Center-Drug Policy Foundation,
many of these early reports had methodological flaws,
and most researchers nowadays propose more cautious conclusions concerning prenatal cocaine effects.
Much evidence would seem to point to the lack of
quality prenatal care and the use of alcohol and
tobacco as primary factors in poor fetal development
among pregnant cocaine users. Research sponsored by
the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) and the
Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia corroborate the Lindensmith Center findings in reporting
that the lack of quality prenatal care is associated with
undesirable effects often attributed to cocaine exposure such as prematurity, low birth weight, and fetal or
infant death. The Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), however, reports that mothers
who use cocaine early in pregnancy are five times as
likely to have a baby with a malformation of the
urinary tract as mothers who do not use the drug.
Thus, cocaine use during pregnancy is inadvisable,
especially since it is also often associated with the use
of alcohol known to cause long-term developmental
918

Medical complications
Cocaine has been linked to several serious health
problems, including:

Other complications may vary depending on how
the drug is administered. Prolonged snorting, for
example, can irritate the nasal septum, producing
nosebleeds, chronic runny nose, and other problems.
Intravenous users face an increased risk of infectious
diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.
Testing
Drug testing can be useful in diagnosing and treating cocaine abuse. Urine testing can detect cocaine;
besides providing an objective alternative to reliance
on what a patient says, such tests can also be used as a
follow-up to treatment to confirm that the patient has
remained drug-free.

Treatment
The last two decades have seen a dramatic rise in
the number of cocaine addicts seeking treatment. But
like all forms of drug abuse, cocaine abuse/addiction is
a multifaceted phenomenon involving environmental,
social, and familial as well as physiological factors.
This greatly complicates the challenge of effectively
treating cocaine addiction.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Cocaine

Pharmacological treatments
To date, no medications have been approved specifically for treating cocaine addiction. But several
were under development at this writing. Selegeline,
delivered either via a time-release pill or a transdermal
patch, shows promise as a possible anti-cocaine medication. Clinical studies have shown the drug disulfiram (also used to treat alcoholics) to be effective in
treating cocaine abusers. In addition, antidepressant
medications are sometimes used to control the mood
swings associated with the early stages of cocaine withdrawal. Research in 2004 was looking at new
approach—treating cocaine addiction with a virus
that helped clear the drug from the brain.
Behavioral approaches
A wide range of behavioral interventions have
been successfully used to treat cocaine addiction. The
approach used must be tailored to the specific needs of
each individual patient, however.
Contingency management rewards drug abstinence (confirmed by urine testing) with points or vouchers which patients can exchange for such things as
an evening out or membership in a gym. Cognitivebehavioral therapy helps users learn to recognize and
avoid situations most likely to lead to cocaine use and
to develop healthier ways to cope with stressful situations. Residential programs/therapeutic communities
may also be helpful, particularly in more severe cases.
Patients typically spend six to 12 months in such programs, which may also include vocational training and
other features.

Alternative treatment
Various alternative or complementary approaches
have been used in treating cocaine addiction, often in
combination with more conventional therapies. In
Japan, the herb acorus has been traditionally used
both to assist early-stage cocaine withdrawal and in
later recovery stages. Other herbs sometimes used to
treat drug addictions of various kinds include kola nut,
guarana seed and yohimbe (to boost short-term
energy), and valerian root, hops leaf, scullcap leaf,
and chamomile (to calm the patient). The amino acids
phenylalanine and tyrosine have been used to reduce
cocaine addicts’ craving for the drug, and vitamin therapy may be used to help strengthen the patient. Gentle
massage has been used to help infants born with congenital cocaine addiction. Other techniques, such as
acupuncture, EEG biofeedback, and visualization, may
also be useful in treating addiction.

crave the drug for years and are at risk for relapse.
However, research also has consistently shown that
treatment can significantly reduce both drug abuse
and subsequent criminal activity. The comprehensive
Services Research Outcomes Study (1998) found a 45%
drop in cocaine use five years after treatment, compared to use during the five years before treatment.
The study also found that females generally respond
better to treatment than males, and older patients tend
to reduce their drug use more than younger patients.
Some research also supports the idea that 12-step
programs used in conjunction with other approaches
can significantly enhance the prospects for a positive
outcome. One study of people in outpatient drugtreatment programs found that participation in a
12-step program nearly doubled their chances of
remaining drug-free.

I Coccidioidomycosis
Definition
Coccidioidomycosis is an infection caused by inhaling the microscopic spores of the fungus Coccidioides
immitis. Spores are the tiny, thick-walled structures
that fungi use to reproduce. Coccidioidomycosis exists
in three forms. The acute form produces flu-like symptoms. The chronic form can develop as many as 20 years
after initial infection and, in the lungs, can produce
inflamed, injured areas that can fill with pus (abscesses).
Disseminated coccidioidomycosis describes the type of
coccidioidomycosis that spreads throughout the body
affecting many organ systems and is often fatal.

Description
Coccidioidomycosis is an airborne infection. The
fungus that causes the disease is found in the dry desert
soil of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and
Central and South America. Coccidioidomycosis is
sometimes called San Joaquin fever, valley fever, or
desert fever because of its prevalence in the farming
920

Chronic and disseminated forms of coccidioidomycosis occur more frequently in men and pregnant
women. Although it is not clear why, people of color
are 10–20 times more likely to develop the disseminated
form of the disease than caucasians. People who have a
weakened immune system (immunocompromised),
either from diseases such as AIDS or leukemia, or as
the result of medications that suppressed the immune
system (corticosteroids, chemotherapy), are more likely
to develop disseminated coccidioidomycosis.

Causes and symptoms
When the spores of C. immitis are inhaled, they
can become lodged in the lungs, divide, and cause
localized inflammation. This is known as acute or
primary coccidioidomycosis. The disease is not spread
from one person to another. Approximately 60% of
people who are infected exhibit no symptoms (asymptomatic). In the other 40%, symptoms appear 10–30
days after exposure. These symptoms include a fever
which can reach 104  F (39.5  C), dry cough, chest
pains, joint and muscle aches, headache, and weight
loss. About two weeks after the start of the fever, some
people develop a painful red rash or lumps on the
lower legs. Symptoms usually disappear without treatment in about one month. People who have been
infected gain partial immunity to reinfection.
The chronic form of coccidioidomycosis normally
occurs after a long latent period of 20 or more years
during which the patient experiences no symptoms of
the disease. In the chronic phase, coccidioidomycosis
causes lung abscesses that rupture, spilling pus and
fluid into the lungs, and causing serious damage to
the lungs. The patient experiences difficulty breathing
and has a fever, chest pain, and other signs of pneumonia. Medical treatment is essential for recovery.
In its disseminated form, coccidioidomycosis
spreads to other parts of the body including the liver,
bones, skin, brain, heart, and lining around the heart
(pericardium). Symptoms include fever, joint pain,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis
Many cases of coccidioidomycosis go undiagnosed because the symptoms resemble those of common viral diseases. However, a skin test similar to that
for tuberculosis will determine whether a person has
been infected. The test is simple and accurate, but it
does not indicate whether the disease was limited to its
acute form or if it has progressed to its chronic form.
Diagnosis of chronic or disseminated coccidioidomycosis is made by culturing a sample of sputum or
other body fluids in the laboratory to isolate the fungus. A blood serum test is used to detect the presence
of an antibody produced in response to C. immitis
infection. Chest x rays are often used to assess lung
damage, but alone cannot lead to a definitive diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis because other diseases can
produce similar results on the x ray.

Treatment
In most cases of acute coccidioidomycosis, the
body’s own immune system is adequate to bring
about recovery without medical intervention. Fever
and pain can be treated with non-prescription drugs.
Chronic and disseminated coccidioidomycosis,
however, are serious diseases that require treatment
with prescription drugs. Patients with intact immune
systems who develop chronic coccidiodomycosis are
treated with the drug ketoconazole (Nizoral) or
amphotericin B (Fungizone). Patients with suppressed
immune systems are treated with amphotericin B
(Fungizone). Amphotericin B is a powerful fungistatic
drug with potentially toxic side effects. As a result,
hospitalization is required in order to monitor
patients. The patient may also receive other drugs to
minimize the side effects of the amphotericin B.
Patients with AIDS must continue to take itraconazole (Sporonox) or fluconazole (Diflucan) orally
or receive weekly intravenous doses of amphotericin
B for the rest of their lives in order to prevent a
relapse. Because of the high cost of fluconazole,
Pfizer, the manufacturer of the drug, has established
a financial assistance plan to make the drug available
at lower cost to those who meet certain criteria.
Patients needing this drug should ask their doctors
about this program.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS
Abscess—An area of inflamed and injured body
tissue that fills with pus.
Acidophilus—The bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus that usually found in yogurt.
Antibody—A specific protein produced by the
immune system in response to a specific foreign
protein or particle called an antigen.
Antigen—A foreign protein to which the body
reacts by making antibodies.
Asymptomatic—Persons who carry a disease but
who do not exhibit symptoms of the disease are
said to be asymptomatic.
Bifidobacteria—A group of bacteria normally present in the intestine. Commercial supplements containing these bacteria are available.
Corticosteroids—A group of hormones produced
naturally by the adrenal gland or manufactured
synthetically. They are often used to treat inflammation. Examples include cortisone and prednisone.
Immunocompromised—A state in which the immune system is suppressed or not functioning properly.
Meningitis—An inflammation of the membranes
surrounding the brain or spinal cord.
Pericardium—The tissue sac around the heart.

Alternative treatment
Alternative treatment for fungal infections
focuses on creating an internal environment where
the fungus cannot survive. This is accomplished by
eating a diet low in dairy products, sugars, including
honey and fruit juice, and foods like beer that contain
yeast. This is complemented by a diet consisting, in
large part, of uncooked and unprocessed foods.
Supplements of vitamins C, E, A-plus, and B complex
may also be useful. Lactobacillus acidophilus and
Bifidobacterium will replenish the good bacteria in
the intestines. Antifungal herbs, like garlic (Allium
sativum), can be consumed in relatively large does
and for an extended period of time in order to increase
effectiveness.

Prognosis
Most people who are infected with coccidiodomycosis only suffer from the mild, acute form of the
disease and recover without further complications.

Coccidioidomycosis

loss of appetite, weight loss, night sweats, skin lesions,
and difficulty breathing. Also, in 30–50% of patients
with disseminated coccidioidomycosis, the tissue coverings of the brain and spinal cord become inflamed
(meningitis).

Coccyx injuries

Patients who suffer from chronic coccidiodomycosis
and who have no underlying lung or immune system
diseases also stand a good change of recovery,
although they must be alert to a relapse.
The picture for patients with the disseminated
form of the disease, many of whom have AIDS, is
less positive. Untreated disseminated coccidiodomycosis is almost always fatal within a short time. With
treatment, chance of survival increases, but the death
rate remains high when meningitis or diffuse lung
(pulmonary) disease is present. AIDS patients must
constantly guard against relapse.

Prevention
Because the fungus that causes coccidioidomycosis is airborne and microscopic, the only method
of prevention is to avoid visiting areas where it is
found in the soil. Unfortunately, for many people
this is impractical. Maintaining general good health
and avoiding HIV infection will limit coccidioidomycosis to the acute and relatively mild form in most
people.

Description
The coccyx consists of fused vertebrae, which are
not flexible like the other vertebrae of the vertebral
column which are all interspaced by intervertebral
disks and joined together by elastic ligaments. Since
the spinal cord ends just before the coccyx begins,
coccygeal vertebrae also lack a central foramen
(hole). In the coccyx, the vertebrae generally fuse
together in early adulthood and may also fuse with
the sacrum, the bone located between the fifth lumbar
vertebra and the coccyx, as a person ages. In males, the
coccyx curves downward, and in females, it is straighter to allow a baby to pass through the birth canal
without impediment.
Pain in or around the coccyx is called coccydynia
or coccygodynia. Coccydynia presents a range of
symptoms associated to a variety of underlying causes
and conditions.

Causes and symptoms
Causes
Coccydynia can be caused by a number of factors.
Usually, patients report pain after a fall onto their
buttocks, as occurs when going down stairs or while
skating. Others have pain during pregnancy or after
childbirth. Some experience repetitive strain from rowing or cycling, and some cite anal intercourse as the
cause of pain. In many cases, pain derives from a
malformation of the coccyx itself. Sometimes bony
spurs appear on the coccyx, but only seem to be painful in thin patients who do not have the padding to
protect the region from the spur.
Other causes of coccydynia include cancer or
damage to the sacrum that generates referred pain,
meaning pain that appears in one region but originates
from another. Muscle strain or tension, pinched
nerves or damaged nerves, or dislocation of the coccyx
due to gross obesity are other causes.
Symptoms

I Coccyx injuries
Definition
The coccyx—or tailbone—is the last bone of the
vertebral column, and usually consists of three to five
fused vertebrae that connect with the sacrum, a part of
the pelvis.
922

The most common symptom of coccydynia, irrespective of the cause of the condition, is pain when
sitting, or when rising from a sitting position. If the
condition lasts long enough, the patient may even
experience pain when standing or lying down.
Sometimes, numbness occurs in the lower part of the
spine. Some patients will experience pain during bowel
movements, sexual intercourse, or menstruation.
Secondary symptoms include back pain from sitting in odd positions in order to relieve pain, and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Diagnosis
Diagnosis of fracture is usually made by inserting
a gloved finger in the rectum and pressing on the
coccyx. X rays and magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) are also often used. Since coccyx pain may be
the result of other factors like cancer, these must be
ruled out through a variety of tests before treatment
can begin.

Treatment
Treatment exists to either control the pain or
eliminate the cause. Pain control may be dangerous if
an underlying condition exists of which the pain is a
warning sign. Nerve blocks and a variety of drugs are
other options to control pain.
Elimination of the root cause of the pain is ideal.
This is done through careful diagnosis and the application of manual treatments, corticosteroid injections
into the coccyx vertebrae, or surgery. Injections into
the fourth and fifth sacral nerves and coccygeal nerves
often bring relief, but are considered more as a pain
control measure than as curative treatment. Manual
treatments have not been found to be effective.
Surgery is a radical procedure whose indications are
inconsistent and dependent on the subjectivity of the
physician.

pelvis.
Spinal cord—Elongated nerve bundles that lie in
the vertebral canal and from which the spinal

Vertebrae—Bones in the cervical, thoracic, and
lumbar regions of the body that make up the vertebral column. Vertebrae have a central foramen

vertebral canal that encloses the spinal cord.
Vertebral column—The vertebral column, also
called the spinal column or spine, consists of a
series of vertebrae connected by ligaments. It provides a supporting axis for the body and protects
the spinal cord. The vertebral column consists of
seven cervical vertebrae in the neck, followed by
12 thoracic vertebrae that connect to the ribs, five
lumbar vertebrae in the lower back, the sacrum,
and the coccyx.

With current treatment, prognosis is good and

Definition
A cochlear implant is a surgical treatment for
hearing loss that works like an artificial human cochlea
in the inner ear, helping to send sound from the ear to

the brain. It is different from a hearing aid, which
simply amplifies sound.

Purpose
A cochlear implant bypasses damaged hair cells
and helps establish some degree of hearing by stimulating the hearing (auditory) nerve directly.

Precautions
Because the implants are controversial, very
expensive, and have uncertain results, the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) has limited the
implants to people:


who get no significant benefit from hearing aids



who are at least two years old (the age at which
specialists can verify severity of deafness)



with severe to profound hearing loss

Description
Hearing loss is caused by a number of different
problems that occur either in the hearing nerve or
parts of the middle or inner ear. The most common
type of deafness is caused by damaged hair cells in the
cochlea, the hearing part of the inner ear. Normally,
hair cells stimulate the hearing nerve, which transmits
sound signals to the brain. When hair cells stop functioning, the hearing nerve remains unstimulated, and
the person cannot hear. Hair cells can be destroyed by
many things, including infection, trauma, loud noise,
aging, or birth defects.
All cochlear implants consist of a microphone
worn behind the ear that picks up sound and sends it
along a wire to a speech processor, which is worn in a
small shoulder pouch, pocket, or belt. The processor
boosts the sound, filters out background noise, and
turns sound into digital signals before sending it to a
transmitter worn behind the ear. A magnet holds the
transmitter in place through its attraction to the receiver-stimulator, a part of the device that is surgically
attached beneath the skin in the skull. The receiver
picks up digital signs forwarded by the transmitter,
and converts them into electrical impulses. These electrical impulses flow through electrodes contained in a
narrow, flexible tube that has been threaded into the
cochlea.
As many as 24 electrodes (depending on the type
of implant) carry the impulses that stimulate the hearing nerve. The brain then interprets the signals as
specific sounds.

Despite the benefits that the implant appears to
offer, some hearing specialists and members of the
deaf community still believe that the benefits may
not outweigh the risks and limitations of the device.
Because the device must be surgically implanted, it
carries some surgical risk. Also, manufacturers cannot
promise how well a person will hear with an implant.
Moreover, after getting an implant, some people say
they feel alienated from the deaf community, while at
the same time not feeling fully a part of the hearing
world.
The sounds heard through an implant are different from the normal hearing sounds, and have been
described as artificial or ‘‘robotlike.’’ This is because
the implant’s handful of electrodes cannot hope to
match the complexity of a person’s 15,000 hair cells.
Surgical procedure
During the procedure, the surgeon makes an incision behind the ear and opens the mastoid bone (the
ridge on the skull behind the ear) leading into the
middle ear. The surgeon then places the receiverstimulator in the bone, and gently threads the electrodes into the cochlea. This operation takes between one
and one-half to five hours.

Preparation
Before a person gets an implant, specialists at an
implant clinic conduct a careful evaluation, including
extensive hearing tests to determine how well the candidate can hear.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict who
will benefit from an implant. In general, the later in life
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

First, candidates undergo a trial with a powerful
hearing aid. If the aid cannot improve hearing enough,
a physician then performs a physical exam and orders a
scan of the inner ear (some patients with a scarred
cochlea are not good candidates). A doctor may also
order a psychological exam to better understand the
person’s expectations. Patients need to be highly motivated, and have a realistic understanding of what an
implant can and cannot do.

Aftercare
The patient remains in the hospital for a day or
two after the surgery. After a month, the surgical
wounds will have healed and the patient returns to
the implant clinic to be fitted with the external parts
of the device (the speech processor, microphone, and
transmitter). A clinicican tunes the speech processor
and sets levels of stimulation for each electrode, from
soft to loud.
The patient is then trained in how to interpret the
sounds heard through the device. The length of the
training varies from days to years, depending on how
well the person can interpret the sounds heard through
the device.

Risks
As with all operations, there are a few risks of
surgery. These include:


dizziness



facial paralysis (rarely)



infection at the incision site

Scientists are not sure about the long-term effects
of electrical stimulation on the nervous system. It is
also possible to damage the implant’s internal components by a blow to the head, which will render the
device unworkable.

Normal results
Most profoundly, deaf patients who receive an
implant are able to discern medium and loud sounds,
including speech, at comfortable listening levels.
Many use sound clues from the implant, together
with speech reading and other facial cues. Almost all
adults improve their communication skills when

Children who were born deaf or who lost their

however, that most of these children are able to learn
spoken language and understand speech using the

Cognitive-behavioral therapy

I Cognitive-behavioral therapy
Definition
Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an action-oriented
form of psychosocial therapy that assumes that maladaptive, or faulty, thinking patterns cause maladaptive
behavior and ‘‘negative’’ emotions. (Maladaptive behavior is behavior that is counter-productive or interferes
with everyday living.) The treatment focuses on changing an individual’s thoughts (cognitive patterns) in
order to change his or her behavior and emotional
state.

Purpose
Theoretically, cognitive-behavioral therapy can
be employed in any situation in which there is a pattern of unwanted behavior accompanied by distress
and impairment. It is a recommended treatment
option for a number of mental disorders, including
affective (mood) disorders, personality disorders,
social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),
eating disorders, substance abuse, anxiety or panic disorder, agoraphobia, post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD). It is also frequently used as a tool to deal
with chronic pain for patients with illnesses such as
rheumatoid arthritis, back problems, and cancer.
Patients with sleep disorders may also find cognitivebehavioral therapy a useful treatment for insomnia.

that maladaptive behaviors and disturbed mood or
emotions are the result of inappropriate or irrational
thinking patterns, called automatic thoughts. Instead
of reacting to the reality of a situation, an individual
reacts to his or her own distorted viewpoint of the
situation. For example, a person may conclude that
he is ‘‘worthless’’ simply because he failed an exam or
did not get a date. Cognitive therapists attempt to
make their patients aware of these distorted thinking
patterns, or cognitive distortions, and change them
(a process termed cognitive restructuring).
Behavioral therapy, or behavior modification,
trains individuals to replace undesirable behaviors
with healthier behavioral patterns. Unlike psychodynamic therapies, it does not focus on uncovering or
understanding the unconscious motivations that may
be behind the maladaptive behavior. In other words,
strictly behavioral therapists do not try to find out why
their patients behave the way they do, they just teach
them to change the behavior.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy combines the individual goals of cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy integrates the cognitive restructuring approach of cognitive therapy
with the behavioral modification techniques of behavioral therapy. The therapist works with the patient to
identify both the thoughts and the behaviors that are
causing distress, and to change those thoughts in order
to readjust the behavior. In some cases, the patient
may have certain fundamental core beliefs, called
schemas, which are flawed and require modification.
For example, a patient suffering from depression may
be avoiding social contact with others, and suffering
considerable emotional distress because of his isolation. When questioned why, the patient reveals to his
therapist that he is afraid of rejection, of what others
may do or say to him. Upon further exploration with
his therapist, they discover that his real fear is not
rejection, but the belief that he is hopelessly uninteresting and unlovable. His therapist then tests the reality of that assertion by having the patient name
friends and family who love him and enjoy his company. By showing the patient that others value him,
the therapist both exposes the irrationality of the
patient’s belief and provides him with a new model
of thought to change his old behavior pattern. In this
case, the person learns to think, ‘‘I am an interesting
and lovable person; therefore I should not have difficulty making new friends in social situations.’’ If
enough ‘‘irrational cognitions’’ are changed, this
patient may experience considerable relief from his
depression.

Pioneered by psychologists Aaron Beck and
Albert Ellis in the 1960s, cognitive therapy assumes

A number of different techniques may be
employed in cognitive-behavioral therapy to help

Precautions
Cognitive-behavioral therapy may not be suitable
for some patients. Those who do not have a specific
behavioral issue they wish to address and whose goals
for therapy are to gain insight into the past may be
better served by psychodynamic therapy. Patients
must also be willing to take a very active role in the
treatment process.
Cognitive-behavioral intervention may be inappropriate for some severely psychotic patients and
for cognitively impaired patients (for example,
patients with organic brain disease or a traumatic
brain injury), depending on their level of functioning.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE



Behavioral homework assignments. Cognitive-behavioral therapists frequently request that their
patients complete homework assignments between
therapy sessions. These may consist of real-life
‘‘behavioral experiments’’ where patients are encouraged to try out new responses to situations discussed
in therapy sessions.



Cognitive rehearsal. The patient imagines a difficult
situation and the therapist guides him through the
step-by-step process of facing and successfully dealing with it. The patient then works on practicing, or
rehearsing, these steps mentally. Ideally, when the
situation arises in real life, the patient will draw on
the rehearsed behavior to address it.



Journal. Patients are asked to keep a detailed diary
recounting their thoughts, feelings, and actions when
specific situations arise. The journal helps to make
the patient aware of his or her maladaptive thoughts
and to show their consequences on behavior. In later
stages of therapy, it may serve to demonstrate and
reinforce positive behaviors.



Modeling. The therapist and patient engage in roleplaying exercises in which the therapist acts out
appropriate behaviors or responses to situations.



Conditioning. The therapist uses reinforcement to
encourage a particular behavior. For example, a
child with ADHD gets a gold star every time he
stays focused on tasks and accomplishes certain
daily chores. The gold star reinforces and increases
the desired behavior by identifying it with something
positive. Reinforcement can also be used to extinguish unwanted behaviors by imposing negative
consequences.



Systematic desensitization. Patients imagine a situation they fear, while the therapist employs techniques
to help the patient relax, helping the person cope with
their fear reaction and eventually eliminate the anxiety
altogether. For example, a patient in treatment for
agoraphobia, or fear of open or public places, will
relax and then picture herself on the sidewalk outside
of her house. In her next session, she may relax herself
and then imagine a visit to a crowded shopping mall.
The imagery of the anxiety-producing situations gets
progressively more intense until, eventually, the therapist and patient approach the anxiety-causing situation in real-life (a ‘‘graded exposure’’), perhaps by
visiting a mall. Exposure may be increased to the
point of ‘‘flooding,’’ providing maximum exposure
to the real situation. By repeatedly pairing a desired
response (relaxation) with a fear-producing situation

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

(open, public spaces), the patient gradually becomes
desensitized to the old response of fear and learns to
react with feelings of relaxation.


Validity testing. Patients are asked to test the validity
of the automatic thoughts and schemas they encounter. The therapist may ask the patient to defend or
produce evidence that a schema is true. If the patient
is unable to meet the challenge, the faulty nature of
the schema is exposed.

Initial treatment sessions are typically spent
explaining the basic tenets of cognitive-behavioral therapy to the patient and establishing a positive working
relationship between therapist and patient. Cognitivebehavioral therapy is a collaborative, action-oriented
therapy effort. As such, it empowers the patient by
giving him an active role in the therapy process and
discourages any overdependence on the therapist that
may occur in other therapeutic relationships. Therapy
is typically administered in an outpatient setting in
either an individual or group session. Therapists
include psychologists (Ph.D., Psy.D., Ed.D. or M.A.
degree), clinical social workers (M.S.W., D.S.W., or
L.S.W. degree), counselors (M.A. or M.S. degree), or
psychiatrists (M.D. with specialization in psychiatry)
and should be trained in cognitive-behavioral techniques, although some brief cognitive-behavioral interventions may be suggested by a primary physician/
caregiver. Treatment is relatively short in comparison
to some other forms of psychotherapy, usually lasting
no longer than 16 weeks. Many insurance plans provide
reimbursement for cognitive-behavioral therapy services. Because coverage is dependent on the disorder
or illness the therapy is treating, patients should check
with their individual plans.
Rational-emotive behavior therapy
Rational-emotive behavior therapy (REBT) is a
popular variation of cognitive-behavioral therapy
developed in 1955 by psychologist Albert Ellis.
REBT is based on the belief that a person’s past
experiences shape their belief system and thinking
patterns. People form illogical, irrational thinking patterns that become the cause of both their negative
emotions and of further irrational ideas. REBT
focuses on helping patients discover these irrational
beliefs that guide their behavior and replace them with
rational beliefs and thoughts in order to relieve their
emotional distress.
There are 10 basic irrational assumptions that
trigger maladaptive emotions and behaviors:

Meichenbaum’s self-instructional approach

Psychologist Donald Meichenbaum pioneered the
self-instructional, or ‘‘self-talk,’’ approach to cognitivebehavioral therapy in the 1970s. This approach focuses
on changing what people say to themselves, both
internally and out loud. It is based on the belief that
an individual’s actions follow directly from this selftalk. This type of therapy emphasizes teaching patients
coping skills that they can use in a variety of situations
to help themselves. The technique used to accomplish
this is self-instructional inner dialogue, a method of
talking through a problem or situation as it occurs.

KEY TERMS
Automatic thoughts—Thoughts that automatically
come to mind when a particular situation occurs.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy seeks to challenge
automatic thoughts.
Cognitive restructuring—The process of replacing
maladaptive thought patterns with constructive
thoughts and beliefs.
Maladaptive—Unsuitable or counterproductive;
for example, maladaptive behavior is behavior
that is inappropriate to a given situation.
Psychodynamic therapy—A therapeutic approach
that assumes dysfunctional or unwanted behavior
is caused by unconscious, internal conflicts and
focuses on gaining insight into these motivations.
Relaxation technique—A technique used to
relieve stress. Exercise, biofeedback, hypnosis,
and meditation are all effective relaxation tools.
Relaxation techniques are used in cognitive-behavioral therapy to teach patients new ways of coping

use to view the world. Cognitive-behavioral therapy seeks to change maladaptive schemas.

opportunity to find out important details about the
therapist’s approach to treatment, professional credentials, and any other issues of interest.
In some managed-care clinical settings, an intake
interview or evaluation is required before a patient
begins therapy. The intake interview is used to evaluate the patient and assign him or her to a therapist. It
may be conducted by a psychiatric nurse, counselor, or
social worker.

Preparation
Patients may seek therapy independently, or be
referred for treatment by a primary physician, psychologist, or psychiatrist. Because the patient and
therapist work closely together to achieve specific
therapeutic objectives, it is important that their working relationship is comfortable and their goals are
compatible. Prior to beginning treatment, the patient
and therapist should meet for a consultation session,
or mutual interview. The consultation gives the therapist the opportunity to make an initial assessment of
the patient and recommend a course of treatment
and goals for therapy. It also gives the patient an

Many patients who undergo cognitive-behavioral
therapy successfully learn how to replace their maladaptive thoughts and behaviors with positive ones that
facilitate individual growth and happiness. Cognitivebehavioral therapy may be used in conjunction with
pharmaceutical and other treatment interventions, so
overall success rates are difficult to gauge. However,
success rates of 65% or more have been reported with
cognitive-behavioral therapy alone as a treatment for
panic attacks and agoraphobia. Relapse has been

I Cold agglutinins test
Definition
The cold agglutinins test is performed to detect the
presence of antibodies in blood that are sensitive to
temperature changes. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to specific
disease agents; autoantibodies are antibodies that the
body produces against one of its own substances. Cold
agglutinins are autoantibodies that cause red blood
cells to clump, but only when the blood is cooled
below the normal body temperature of 98.6  F
(37  C). The clumping is most pronounced at temperatures below 78  F (25.6  C).

Purpose
The cold agglutinins test is used to confirm the
diagnosis of certain diseases that stimulate the body to
produce cold agglutinins. The disease most commonly
diagnosed by this test is mycoplasmal pneumonia, but
mononucleosis, mumps, measles, scarlet fever, some
parasitic infections, cirrhosis of the liver, and some
types of hemolytic anemia can also cause the formation
of cold agglutinins. Hemolytic anemias are conditions
in which the blood is low in oxygen because the red
blood cells are breaking down at a faster rate than their
normal life expectancy of 120 days. In addition to these
illnesses, some people have a benign condition called
chronic cold agglutinin disease, in which exposure to
cold causes temporary clumping of red blood cells and
consequent numbness in ears, fingers, and toes.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

KEY TERMS
Agglutinin—An antibody that causes red blood
cells to stick or clump together.
Antibody—A protein molecule produced by the
immune system that is specific to a disease agent,
such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The antibody
combines with the organism and disables it.
Autoantibody—An antibody produced by the body
in reaction to any of its own cells or cell products.
Cold agglutinins—Antibodies that cause clumping
of red blood cells when the blood temperature falls
below normal body temperature (98.6  F/37  C).
Hemolytic anemia—Oxygen deficiency in the
blood, caused by shortened survival of red blood
cells.
Mycoplasma—A type of free-living microorganism
that has no cell wall. Mycoplasmas cause some
varieties of pneumonia and urinary tract infections
that stimulate the body to produce cold agglutinins.
Titer—The concentration of a substance in a given
sample of blood or other tissue fluid.

Description
Since cold agglutinins cause red blood cells to
clump only at temperatures lower than 98.6  F (37  C),
the test consists of chilling a sample of the patient’s
blood. There is a bedside version of the test in which
the doctor collects four or five drops of blood in a small
tube, cools the tube in ice water for 30–60 seconds, and
looks for clumping of red blood cells. If the cells clump
after chilling and unclump as they rewarm, a cold agglutinin titer (concentration) greater than 1:64 is present.
Bedside test results, however, should be confirmed by a
laboratory. The laboratory test measures the clumping
of red blood cells in different dilutions of the patient’s
blood serum at 39.2  F (4  C).

Normal results
The results of the cold agglutinins test require a
doctor’s interpretation. In general, however, a normal
value is lower than 1:32.

Abnormal results
Any value higher than 1:32 suggests a diagnosis of
mycoplasmal pneumonia or one of the other viral
infections or disease conditions indicated by this test.

I Cold sore
Definition
A cold sore is a fluid-filled blister which usually
appears at the edge of the lips. Cold sores are caused
by a herpes simplex virus infection.

Description
A cold sore is a fluid-filled, painful blister that is
usually on or around the lips. Other names for a cold
sore are fever blister, oral herpes, labial herpes, herpes
labialis, and herpes febrilis. Cold sores most often
occur on the lips which distinguishes them from
the common canker sore which is usually inside the
mouth. Cold sores do not usually occur inside the
mouth except during the initial episode. Canker sores
usually form either on the tongue or inside the cheeks.
Cold sores are caused by a herpes virus. There are
eight different kinds of human herpes viruses. Only
two of these, herpes simplex types 1 and 2, can cause
cold sores. It is commonly believed that herpes simplex
virus type 1 infects above the waist and herpes simplex
virus type 2 infects below the waist. This is not completely true. Both herpes virus type 1 and type 2 can
cause herpes lesions on the lips or genitals, but recurrent cold sores are almost always type 1.
Oral herpes is very common. More than 60% of
Americans have had a cold sore, and almost 25% of
those infected experience recurrent outbreaks. Most
of these persons became infected before age 10. Anyone
can become infected by herpes virus and, once
infected, the virus remains latent for life. Herpes
viruses are spread from person to person by direct
skin-to-skin contact. The highest risk for spreading
the virus is the time period beginning with the appearance of blisters and ending with scab formation.
However, infected persons need not have visible
930

blisters to spread the infection to others since the virus
may be present in the saliva without obvious oral
lesions.
Viruses are different from bacteria. While bacteria
are independent and can reproduce on their own,
viruses enter human cells and force them to make
more virus. The infected human cell is usually killed
and releases thousands of new viruses. The cell death
and resulting tissue damage causes the actual cold
sores. In addition, the herpes virus can infect a cell
and, instead of making the cell produce new viruses, it
hides inside the cell and waits. The herpes virus hides
in the nervous system. This is called ‘‘latency.’’ A
latent virus can wait inside the nervous system for
days, months, or even years. At some future time, the
virus ‘‘awakens’’ and causes the cell to produce thousands of new viruses that cause an active infection.
This process of latency and active infection is best
understood by considering the cold sore cycle. An
active infection is obvious because cold sores are present. The first infection is called the ‘‘primary’’ infection. This active infection is then controlled by the
body’s immune system and the sores heal. In between
active infections, the virus is latent. At some point in
the future, latent viruses become activated and once
again cause sores. These are called ‘‘recurrent’’ infections. Although it is unknown what triggers latent
virus to activate, several conditions seem to bring on
infections. These include stress, illness, tiredness,
exposure to sunlight, menstruation, fever, and diet.

Causes and symptoms
While anyone can be infected by herpes virus, not
everyone will show symptoms. The first symptoms of
herpes occur within two to 20 days after contact with
an infected person. Symptoms of the primary infection
are usually more severe than those of recurrent infections. The primary infection can cause symptoms like
other viral infections including tiredness, headache,
fever, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck.
Typically, 50 to 80% of persons with oral herpes
experience a prodrome (symptoms of oncoming disease) of pain, burning, itching, or tingling at the site
where blisters will form. This prodrome stage may last
anywhere from a few hours to one to two days. The
herpes infection prodrome occurs in both the primary
infection and recurrent infections.
In 95% of the patients with cold sores, the blisters
occur at the outer edge of the lips which is called
the ‘‘vermilion border.’’ Less often, blisters form on
the nose, chin, or cheek. Following the prodrome, the
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Oral herpes may resemble a bacterial infection
called impetigo. This skin infection is most commonly
seen in children and causes herpes-like blisters around
the mouth and nose. Also, because oral herpes can
occur inside the mouth, the blisters could be mistaken
for common canker sores. Therefore, the doctor
would need to determine whether the blisters are oral
herpes, canker sores, or impetigo. The diagnosis and
treatment of herpes infections should be covered by
most insurance providers.

disease process is rapid. First, small red bumps appear
that quickly form fluid-filled blisters. The painful blisters may either burst and form a scab or dry up and
form a scab. Within two days of the first red bumps, all
the blisters have formed scabs. The skin heals completely and without scarring within six to ten days.
Some children have a very serious primary (first
episode) herpes infection called ‘‘gingivostomatitis.’’
This causes fever, swollen lymph glands, and numerous blisters inside the mouth and on the lips and
tongue that may form large, open sores. These painful
sores may last up to three weeks and can make eating
and drinking difficult. Because of this, young children
with gingivostomatitis are at risk for dehydration
(excessive loss of water from the body).
Most people experience fewer than two recurrent
outbreaks of cold sores each year. Some people never
experience outbreaks, while some have very frequent
outbreaks. In most people, the blisters form in the
same area each time and are triggered by the same
factors (such as stress, sun exposure, etc).

Diagnosis
Because oral herpes is so common, it is diagnosed
primarily by symptoms. It can be diagnosed and
treated by the family doctor, dermatologists (doctors

specialists. Laboratory tests may be performed to
look for the virus. Because healing sores do not
shed much virus, a sample from an open sore would
be taken for viral culture. A sterile cotton swab would
be wiped over open sores and the sample used to
infect human cells in culture. Cells that are killed by
the herpes virus have a certain appearance under
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Treatment
There is no cure for herpes virus infections. There
are antiviral drugs available that have some effect on
lessening the symptoms and decreasing the length of
herpes outbreaks. There is evidence that some may
also prevent future outbreaks. These antiviral drugs
work by interfering with the replication of the viruses,
and are most effective when taken as early in the
infection process as possible. For the best results,
drug treatment should begin during the prodrome
stage before blisters are visible. Depending on the
length of the outbreak, drug treatment could continue
for up to 10 days.
Acyclovir (Zovirax) is the drug of choice for herpes
infection and can be given intravenously or taken by
mouth. It can be applied directly to sores as an ointment, but is not very useful in this form. A liquid form
for children is also available. Acyclovir is effective in
treating both the primary infection and recurrent outbreaks. When taken by mouth to prevent an outbreak,
acyclovir reduces the frequency of herpes outbreaks.
During an outbreak of cold sores, salty foods,
citrus foods (oranges etc.), and other foods that irritate the sores should be avoided. Wash the sores once
or twice a day with warm, soapy water and pat gently
to dry. Over-the-counter lip products that contain the
chemical phenol (such as Blistex Medicated Lip
Ointment) and numbing ointments (Anbesol) help to
relieve cold sores. A bandage may be placed over the
sores to protect them and prevent spreading the virus
to other sites on the lips or face. Acetaminophen
(Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) may be taken
if necessary to reduce pain and fever.

Alternative treatment
Vitamin and mineral supplements and diet may
have an effect on the recurrence and duration of
cold sores. In general, cold sore sufferers should eat a

KEY TERMS
Latent—A nonactive virus which is in a dormant
state within a cell. The herpes virus is latent in the
nervous system.
Prodrome—Symptoms that warn of the beginning
of disease. The herpes prodrome consists of pain,
burning, tingling, or itching at a site before blisters
are visible.
Recurrence—The return of an active infection following a period of latency.

healthy diet of unprocessed foods such as vegetables,
fruits, and whole grains. Alcohol, caffeine, and sugar
should be avoided.
An imbalance in the amino acids lysine and arginine is thought to be one contributing factor in herpes
virus outbreaks. A diet that is rich in the amino acid
lysine may help prevent recurrences of cold sores.
Foods which contain high levels of lysine include most
vegetables, legumes, fish, turkey, and chicken. In one
study, patients taking lysine supplements had milder
symptoms during an outbreak, a shorter healing time,
and had fewer outbreaks than patients who did not take
lysine. Patients should take 1,000 mg of lysine three
times a day during a cold sore outbreak and 500 mg
daily on an ongoing basis to prevent recurrences. Intake
of the amino acid arginine should be reduced. Foods
rich in arginine that should be avoided are chocolate,
peanuts, almonds, and other nuts and seeds.
Vitamin C and bioflavonoids (a substance in fruits
that helps the body to absorb and use vitamin C) have
been shown to reduce the duration of a cold sore outbreak and reduce the number of sores. The vitamin B
complex includes important vitamins that support the
nervous system where viruses can hide out. B complex
vitamins can also help manage stress, an important
contributing factor to the outbreak of herpes viruses.
Applying the oil in vitamin E capsules directly to cold
sores may provide relief. Zinc lozenges appear to affect
the reproduction of viruses and also enhance the
immune system. Ointments containing lemon balm
(Melissa officinalis) or licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)
and peppermint (Mentha piperita) have been shown
to help cold sores heal.

herpes, but outbreaks usually occur less frequently
after age 35. The spread of the herpes virus to the eyes
is very serious. The herpes virus can infect the cells in
the cornea and cause scarring that may impair vision.

Prevention
The only way to prevent oral herpes is to avoid
contact with infected persons. This is not an easy
solution because many people are not aware that they
are infected and can easily infect others. Currently there
are no herpes vaccines available, although herpes
vaccines are being tested.
Several practices can reduce the occurrence of
cold sores and the spread of virus to other body locations or people. These practices are:


Avoidance of sun exposure to the face. Before getting
prolonged exposure to the sun, apply sunscreen to
the face and especially to the lips. Wearing a hat with
a large brim is also helpful.



Avoid touching cold sores. Squeezing, picking, or
pinching blisters can allow the virus to spread to
other parts of the lips or face and infect those sites.



Wash hands frequently. Persons with oral herpes
should wash their hands carefully before touching
others. An infected person can spread the virus to
others even when he or she has no obvious blisters.



Avoid contact with others during active infection.
Infected persons should avoid kissing or sexual contact with others until after the cold sores have healed.



Wear gloves when applying ointment to a child’s
sore.



Be especially careful with infants. Never kiss the eyes
or lips of a baby who is under six months old.



Be watchful of infected children. Do not allow
infected children to share toys that may be put into
the mouth. Toys that have been mouthed should be
disinfected before other children play with them.



Maintain good general health. A healthy diet, plenty
of sleep, and exercise help to minimize the chance of
getting a cold or the flu, which are known to bring on
cold sores. Also, good general health keeps the
immune system strong; this helps to keep the virus
in check and prevents outbreaks.

colic do not seem to be in pain between attacks.

Colds see Common cold

Diagnosis
Pediatricians and family physicians suspect colic
in an infant who:

I Colic
Definition
Colic is persistent, unexplained crying in a healthy
baby between two weeks and five months of age.

Description
Colic, which is not a disease, affects 10–20% of all
infants. It is more common in boys than in girls and
most common in a family’s first child. Symptoms of
colic usually appear when a baby is 14–21 days old,
reach a crescendo at the age of three months, and
disappear within the next eight weeks. Episodes
occur frequently but intermittently and usually begin
with prolonged periods of crying in the late afternoon
or evening. They can last for just a few minutes or
continue for several hours. Some babies who have
colic are simply fussy. Others cry so hard that their
faces turn red, then pale.

Causes and symptoms
No one knows what causes colic. The condition
may be the result of swallowing large amounts of air,
which becomes trapped in the digestive tract and
causes bloating and severe abdominal pain.
Other possible causes of colic include:


digestive tract immaturity



food intolerances



hunger or overfeeding



lack of sleep



loneliness



overheated milk or formula



overstimulation resulting from noise, light, or activity



tension

During a colicky episode, babies’ bellies often
look swollen, feel hard, and make a rumbling sound.
Crying intensifies, tapers off, then gets louder. Many
babies grow rigid, clench their fists, curl their toes, and
draw their legs toward their body. A burp or a bowel

three times a week for three weeks or longer



is not hungry but cries for several hours between
dinnertime and midnight



demonstrates the clenched fists, rigidity, and other
physical traits associated with colic

The baby’s medical history and a parent’s description of eating, sleeping, and crying patterns are used to
confirm a diagnosis of colic. Physical examination and
laboratory tests are used to rule out infection, intestinal blockage, and other conditions that can cause
abdominal pain and other colic-like symptoms.

Treatment
Medications do not cure colic. Doctors sometimes
recommend simethicone (Mylicon Drops) to relieve
gas pain, but generally advise parents to take a practical approach to the problem.
Gently massaging the baby’s back can release a
trapped gas bubble, and holding the baby in a sitting
position can help prevent air from being swallowed
during feedings. Bottle-fed babies can swallow air if
nipple holes are either too large or too small.
Nipple-hole size can be checked by filling a bottle
with cold formula, turning it upside down, and counting the number of drops released when it is shaken or
squeezed. A nipple hole that is the right size will release
about one drop of formula every second.
Babies should not be fed every time they cry, but
feeding and burping a baby more often may alleviate
symptoms of colic. A bottle-fed baby should be
burped after every ounce, and a baby who is breastfeeding should be burped every five minutes.
When cow’s milk is the source of the symptoms,
bottle-fed babies should be switched to a soy milk
hydrolyzed protein formula. A woman whose baby is
breastfeeding should eliminate dairy products from
her diet for seven days, then gradually reintroduce
them unless the baby’s symptoms reappear.
Since intolerance to foods other than cow’s milk
may also lead to symptoms of colic, breastfeeding
women may also relieve their babies’ colic by eliminating from their diet:

Rocking a baby in a quiet, darkened room can
prevent overstimulation, and a baby usually calms
down when cuddled in a warm, soft blanket.
Colicky babies cry less when they are soothed by
the motion of a wind-up swing, a car ride, or being
carried in a parent’s arms. Pacifiers can soothe babies
who are upset, but a pacifier should never be attached
to a string.
A doctor should be notified if a baby who has
been diagnosed with colic:

Prevention
Many doctors believe that colic cannot be prevented. Some alternative practitioners, however, feel
that colic can be prevented by an awareness of food
intolerances and their impact.

piperita), or dill (Anethum graveolens) can lessen bowel
inflammation and reduce gas. A homeopathic combination called ‘‘colic’’ may be effective, and constitutional homeopathic treatment can help strengthen the
child’s entire constitution.

Prognosis
Colic is distressing, but it is not dangerous.
Symptoms almost always disappear before a child is
six months old.

Cancer of the colon is the disease characterized by
the development of malignant cells in the lining or
epithelium of the first and longest portion of the
large intestine. Malignant cells have lost normal control mechanisms governing growth. These cells may
invade surrounding local tissue, or they may spread
throughout the body and invade other organ systems.
Synonyms for the colon include the large bowel or
the large intestine. The rectum is the continuation of
the large intestine into the pelvis that terminates in the
anus.

Description
The colon is a tubular organ beginning in the right
lower abdomen. It ascends on the right side of the
abdomen, traverses from right to left in the upper
abdomen, descends vertically down the left side,
takes an S-shaped curve in the lower left abdomen,
and then flows into the rectum as it leaves the abdomen for the pelvis. These portions of the colon are
named separately though they are part of the same
organ:


cecum, the beginning of the colon



ascending colon, the right vertical ascent of the colon
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

transverse colon, the portion traversing from right
to left



descending colon, the left vertical descent of the
colon



sigmoid colon, the s-shaped segment of colon above
the pelvis

These portions of the colon are recognized anatomically based on the arterial blood supply and venous
and lymphatic drainage of these segments of the colon.
Lymph, a protein-rich fluid that bathes the cells of the
body, is transported in small channels known as lymphatics that run alongside the veins of the colon.
Lymph nodes are small filters through which the
lymph travels on its way back to the bloodstream.
Cancer can spread elsewhere in the body by invading
the lymph and vascular systems. Therefore, these anatomic considerations become very important in the
treatment of colon cancer.

identified clinically is later in the progression than
would be desired and screening becomes a very important endeavor to aid in earlier detection of this disease.
There are at least 100,000 cases of colon cancer
diagnosed per year in the United States. Together,
colon and rectal cancers account for 10% of cancers
in men and 11% of cancers in women. It is the second
most common site-specific cancer affecting both men
and women. A 2003 study reported that for unknown
reasons, women are more likely to have advanced
colon cancer at diagnosis than men. Nearly 57,000
people died from colon and rectal cancer in the
United States in 2003. In recent years the incidence
of this disease has decreased slightly, as has the mortality rate. It is difficult to tell if the decrease in mortality reflects earlier diagnosis, less death related to the
actual treatment of the disease, or a combination of
both factors.

The small intestine is the continuation of the
upper gastrointestinal tract that is responsible for carrying ingested nutrients into the body. The waste left
after the small intestine has finished absorbing nutrients amounts to a few liters (about the same as quart)
of material per day and is directly delivered to the
colon (at the cecum) for processing. The colon is
responsible for the preservation of fluid and electrolytes as it propels the increasingly solid waste toward
the rectum and anus for excretion.

Cancer of the colon is thought to arise sporadically in about 80% of those who develop the disease.
Twenty percent of people are thought to have genetic
predisposition, meaning their genes carry a trigger for
the disease. Development of colon cancer at an early
age, or at multiple sites, or recurrent colon cancer,
suggests a genetically transmitted form of the disease
as opposed to the sporadic form.

When cells lining the colon become malignant, they
first grow locally and may invade partially or totally
through the wall of the bowel and even into adjacent
structures and organs. In the process, the tumor can
penetrate and invade the lymphatics or the capillaries
locally and gain access to the circulation. As the malignant cells work their way to other areas of the body,
they again become locally invasive in the new area to
which they have spread. These tumor deposits, originating in the colon primary tumor, are then known as
metastases. If metastases are found in the regional
lymph nodes from the primary, they are known as
regional metastases or regional nodal metastases. If
they are distant from the primary tumor, they are
known as distant metastases. The patient with distant
metastases has systemic disease. Thus, the cancer originating in the colon begins locally and, given time, can
become systemic.

Causes of colon cancer often are environmental
in sporadic cases (80%) and sometimes genetic
(20%). Since malignant cells have a changed genetic
makeup, this means that in 80% of cases, the environment spontaneously induces change, whereas
those born with a genetic predisposition are either
destined to get the cancer or less environmental exposure can induce the cancer. Exposure to agents in the
environment that may induce mutation is the process
of carcinogenesis and is caused by agents known as
carcinogens (cancer-causing agents). Specific carcinogens have been difficult to identify; however, dietary factors seem to be involved.

By the time the primary is originally detected, it is
usually larger than 0.4 in (1 cm) in size and has over
one million cells. This amount of growth itself is estimated to take about three to seven years. Each time
the cells double in number, the size of the tumor
quadruples. Thus, like most cancers, the part that is
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Causes and symptoms

Colon cancer is more common in industrialized
nations. Diets high in fat, red meat, total calories, and
alcohol seem to predispose people to the disease. Diets
high in fiber seem to decrease risk. High-fiber diets
may help lessen exposure of the colon lining to carcinogens from the environment, as the transit time
through the bowel is faster with a high-fiber diet than
it is with a low-fiber diet.
Age plays a definite role in the predisposition to
colon cancer. Two-thirds of all cases occur after age
935

Colon cancer

Colon cancer

50 and the average age for those who develop the
disease is 62.
There also is a slight increased risk for colon
cancer in the individual who smokes.
Patients who suffer from inflammatory diseases of
the colon known as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s colitis are also at increased risk.
Researchers know there is a genetic link to many
cases of colon cancer, those called familial cases. This
is the type of colon cancer that tends to run in families.
In late 2003, a team of researchers identified the specific location on a human chromosome by analyzing
blood samples from 53 families in which at least one
member had a colon cancer or precancerous colon
polyp. At least 200 genes exist on the location of
chromosome 9, however, so the research will continue
to identify the particular gene responsible for the
cancer.
The development of polyps of the colon usually
precedes the development of colon cancer by five or
more years. Polyps are benign growths of the colon
lining. They can be unrelated to cancer, precancerous,
or malignant. Polyps, when identified, are removed for
diagnosis. If the polyps are benign, the patient should
undergo careful surveillance for the development of
more polyps or the development of colon cancer.
Colon cancer causes symptoms related to its local
presence in the large bowel or by its effect on other
organs if it has spread. These symptoms may occur
alone or in combination:


a change in bowel habit



blood in the stool



bloating, persistent abdominal distention



constipation



a feeling of fullness even after having a bowel
movement



narrowing of the stool—so-called ribbon stools



persistent, chronic fatigue



abdominal discomfort



unexplained weight loss



very rarely, nausea and vomiting

Most of these symptoms are caused by the physical presence of the tumor mass in the colon. Similar
symptoms can be caused by other processes; these are
not absolutely specific to colon cancer. The key is
recognizing that the persistence of these types of symptoms without ready explanation should prompt the
individual to seek medical evaluation.
936

If a tumor develops in the colon, it will begin to
cause symptoms as it reaches a certain size. The symptoms are caused by the tumor blocking the opening in
the colon. In addition, the tumor commonly oozes
blood that is lost in the stool. (Often, this blood is
not visible.) This results in anemia and chronic fatigue.
Weight loss is a late symptom, often implying substantial obstruction or the presence of systemic disease.

Diagnosis
Screening
In all other cancers (breast and prostate, for
example), screening tests look for small, malignant
lesions. Screening for colorectal cancers, however, is
the search for pre-malignant, benign polyps. This
screening can be close to 100% effective in preventing
cancer development, not just in detecting small
cancers.
Screening involves physical exam, simple laboratory tests, and the visualization of the lining of the
colon. To visualize the colon epithelium, clinicians use
x rays (indirect visualization) and endoscopy (direct
visualization).
The physical examination involves the performance
of a digital rectal exam (DRE). The DRE includes
manual examination of the rectum, anus, and the prostate. During this examination, the physician examines
the anus and the surrounding skin for hemorrhoids,
abscesses, and other irregularities. After lubricating
the gloved finger and anus, the examiner gently slides
the finger into the anus and follows the contours of the
rectum. The examiner notes the tone of the anus and
feels the walls and the edges for texture, tenderness and
masses as far as the examining finger can reach. At the
time of this exam, the physician checks the stool on the
examining glove with a chemical to see if any occult
(invisible) blood is present. At home, after having a
bowel movement, the patient is asked to swipe a sample
of stool obtained with a small stick on a card. After
three such specimens are on the card, the card is then
easily chemically tested for occult blood also. (The stool
analysis mentioned here is known as a fecal occult blood
test, or FOBT, and, while it can be helpful, it is not
100% accurate—only about 50% of cancers are FOBTpositive.) These exams are accomplished as an easy part
of a routine yearly physical exam.
Proteins are sometimes produced by cancers, and
these may be elevated in the patient’s blood. When this
occurs, the protein produced is known as a tumor
marker. There is a tumor marker for some cancers of
the colon; it is known as carcinoembryonic antigen, or
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Unlike the indirect visualizations of the colon (the
BE and the DCBE), the endoscopic screenings allow
the physician to remove polyps and biopsy suspicious
tissue. (A biopsy is a removal of tissue for examination
by a pathologist.) For this reason, many physicians
prefer endoscopic screening. All of the visualizations,
the BE, DCBE, and each type of endoscopy, require
pre-procedure preparation (evacuation) of the colon.
The American Cancer Society has recommended
the following screening protocol for those at normal
risk over 50 years of age:

CEA. Unfortunately, this protein may be made by
other adenocarcinomas as well, or it may not be produced by a particular colon cancer. Therefore, screening by chemical analysis for CEA has not been helpful.
CEA has been helpful when used in a follow-up role
for patients treated for colon cancer if their tumor
makes the protein.
Indirect visualization of the colon may be accomplished by placing barium through the rectum and
filling the colon with this compound. Barium produces
a white contrast image of the lining of the colon on x
ray and thus, the contour of the lining of the colon
may be seen. Detail can be increased if the barium
utilized is thinned and air also introduced. These studies are known as the barium enema (BE) and the
double contrast barium enema (DCBE).
Direct visualization of the colon lining is accomplished using a scope or endoscope. The physician
introduces the instrument through the rectum. Older,
shorter scopes were rigid. Today, utilizing fiberoptic
technology, the scopes are flexible and can reach much
farther. If the left colon only is visualized, it is called
flexible sigmoidoscopy. When the entire colon is visualized, the procedure is known as colonoscopy
A procedure called virtual colonoscopy has been
developed but debate continues on whether or not it is
effective as colonoscopy. Virtual colonoscopy refers to
the use of imaging, usually with computed tomography
(CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
to produce images of the colon. Studies in late 2003
showed that virtual colonoscopy was as effective as
colonoscopy for screening purposes and it offered the

The American Gastroenterologial Association
revised its screening guidelines in 2003 to recommend
that people with two or more first-degree relatives
with colorectal cancer or a first-degree relative with
colon or rectal cancer before age 60 should have a
screening colonoscopy beginning at age 40 or beginning 10 years prior to the age of the earlier colon
cancer diagnosis in their family (whichever is earliest).
Those with a first-degree relative diagnosed with colon
cancer after age 60 or two second-degree relative with
colon or rectal cancer should begin screening at age 40
with one of the methods listed above, such as annual
sigmoidoscopy.
Evaluation of patients with symptoms
If patients have symptoms that could possibly be
related to colon cancer, the entire colon will be examined. The combination of a flexible sigmoidoscopy
and DCBE may be performed, but the preferred evaluation of the entire colon and rectum is a complete
colonoscopy. Colonoscopy allows direct visualization,
photography, and the opportunity to obtain a biopsy
of any abnormality visualized. If, for technical reasons, the entire colon is not visualized endoscopically,
a DCBE should complement the colonoscopy.
The diagnosis of colon cancer is actually made by
the performance of a biopsy of any abnormal lesion in
the colon. When a tumor growth is identified, it could

advantage of being less invasive and less risky.
However, many physicians were unwilling to accept
it as a replacement for colonoscopy, particularly since
some patients might still require the regular colonoscopy as a follow-up to the virtual procedure if a polyp
or abnormality is found that requires biopsy.

Colon cancer

be either a benign polyp (or lesion) or a cancer; the
biopsy resolves the issue. The endoscopist may take
many samples to exclude any sampling errors.
If the patient has advanced disease at the time of
diagnosis, areas where the tumor has spread (such as
the liver) may be amenable to biopsy. Such biopsies
are usually obtained using a special needle under local
anesthesia.
Once a diagnosis of colon cancer has been established by biopsy, in addition to the physical exam,
studies will be performed to assess the extent of the
disease. Blood studies include a complete blood count,
liver function tests, and a CEA. Imaging studies will
include a chest x ray and a CAT scan (computed tomography scan) of the abdomen. The chest x ray will
determine if the cancer has is spread to the lung, and
the CAT scan will evaluate potential spread to the liver
as well as any local spread of the primary tumor. If the
patient has neurological symptoms, a CAT scan of the
brain will be performed, and if the patient is experiencing bone pain, a bone scan also will be performed.

Treatment
Once the diagnosis has been confirmed by biopsy,
the clinical stage of the cancer is assigned. Using the
characteristics of the primary tumor, its depth of penetration through the bowel, and the presence or absence
of regional or distant metastases, the stage of the
cancer is derived. Often, the depth of penetration
through the bowel or the presence of regional lymph
nodes cannot be assigned before surgery.
Colon cancer is assigned stages I through IV based
on the following general criteria:


Stage I: the tumor is confined to the epithelium or
has not penetrated through the first layer of muscle
in the bowel wall.



Stage II: the tumor has penetrated through to the
outer wall of the colon or has gone through it, possibly invading other local tissue.



Stage III: any depth or size of tumor associated with
regional lymph node involvement.



Stage IV: any of previous criteria associated with
distant metastasis.

With many cancers other than colon cancer, staging plays an important pre-treatment role to best
determine treatment options. Almost all colon cancers
are treated with surgery first, regardless of stage.
Colon cancers through stage III, and even some
stage IV colon cancers, are treated with surgery first
before any other treatments are considered.
938

Surgery
Surgical removal of the involved segment of colon
(colectomy) along with its blood supply and regional
lymph nodes is the primary therapy for colon cancer.
Usually, the partial colectomies are separated into
right, left, transverse, or sigmoid sections based on
the blood supply. The removal of the blood supply at
its origin along with the regional lymph nodes that
accompany it ensures an adequate margin of normal
colon on either side of the primary tumor. When the
cancer lies in a position such that the blood supply and
lymph drainage between two of the major vessels, both
vessels are taken to assure complete radical resection
or removal (extended radical right or left colectomy).
If the primary tumor penetrates through the bowel
wall, any tissue adjacent to the tumor extension is
also taken if feasible.
Surgery is used as primary therapy for stages I
through III colon cancer unless there are signs that
local invasion will not permit complete removal of the
tumor, as may occur in advanced stage III tumors.
However, this circumstance is rare, occurring in less
than 2% of all colon cancer cases.
After the resection is completed, the ends of the
remaining colon are reconstructed; the hook-up is
called an anastomosis. Once healing has occurred,
there may be a slight increase in the frequency of
bowel movements. This effect usually lasts only for
several weeks. Most patients go on to develop completely normal bowel function.
Occasionally, the anastomosis is risky and cannot
be performed. When the anastomosis cannot be performed, a colostomy is performed instead. A colostomy is performed by bringing the end of the colon
through the abdominal wall and sewing it to the skin.
The patient will have to wear an appliance (a bag) to
manage the stool. The colostomy may be temporary
and the patient may undergo a hook-up at a later,
safer date, or the colostomy may be permanent. In
most cases, emergent colostomies are not reversed
and are permanent.
Radiation
Radiation therapy is used as an adjunct to surgery
if there is concern about potential for local recurrence
post-operatively and the area of concern will tolerate
the radiation. For instance, if the tumor invaded muscle of the abdominal wall but was not completely
removed, this area would be considered for radiation.
Radiation has significant dose limits when residual
bowel is exposed to it because the small and large
intestine do not tolerate radiation well.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is useful for patients who have had
all identifiable tumor removed and are at risk for recurrence (adjuvant chemotherapy). Chemotherapy may
also be used when the cancer is stage IV and is beyond
the scope of regional therapy, but this use is rare.
Adjuvant therapy is considered in stage II disease
with deep penetration or in stage III patients.
Standard therapy is treatment with 5-fluorouracil,
(5FU) combined with leucovorin for a period of six
to 12 months. 5FU is an antimetabolite, and leucovorin improves the response rate. (A response is a temporary regression of the cancer from chemotherapy.)
Another agent, levamisole, (which seems to stimulate
the immune system), may be substituted for leucovorin. These protocols reduce rate of recurrence by
about 15% and reduce mortality by about 10%. The
regimens do have some toxicity, but usually are tolerated fairly well.
Similar chemotherapy may be administered for
stage IV disease or if a patient progresses and develops
metastases. Results show response rates of about
20%. Unfortunately, these patients eventually succumb to the disease, and this chemotherapy may not
prolong survival or improve quality of life in Stage IV
patients. Clinical trials have now shown that the
results can be improved with the addition of another
agent to this regimen. Irinotecan does not seem to
increase toxicity but it improved response rates to
39%, added two to three months to disease-free survival, and prolonged overall survival by a little over two
months.

Alternative treatment
Alternative therapies have not been studied in a
large-scale, scientific way. Large doses of vitamins,
fiber, and green tea are among therapies tried.
Avoiding cigarettes and alcohol may be helpful.
Before initiating any alternative therapies, the patient
is wise to consult his or her physician to be sure that
these therapies do not complicate or interfere with the
established therapy.

Prognosis
Prognosis is the long-term outlook or survival
after therapy. Overall, about 50% of patients treated
for colon cancer survive the disease. As expected, the

Colon cancer

Radiation also is used in the treatment of patients
with metastatic disease. It is particularly useful in
shrinking metastatic colon cancer to the brain.

Colonic irrigation

About 15% of patients present with stage I disease
and 85–90% survive. Stage II represents 20–30% of
cases and 65–75% survive. Thirty to forty percent
comprise the stage III presentation of which 55%
survive. The remaining 20–25% present with stage
IV disease and are rarely cured.

Prevention
There is not an absolute method for preventing
colon cancer. Still, there are steps an individual can
take to dramatically lessen the risk or to identify the
precursors of colon cancer so that it does not manifest
itself. High-fiber diets and vitamins, avoiding obesity,
and staying active lessen the risk. Avoiding cigarettes
and alcohol may be helpful. By controlling these environmental factors, an individual can lessen risk and to
this degree prevent the disease.
People who turn age 50, and all of those with a
history of colon cancer in their families, should speak
with their physicians about the most recent screening
recommendations from physician and cancer organizations. They should watch for symptoms and attend
all recommended screenings to increase the likelihood
of catching colon cancer early.

Colonic irrigation is also known as hydrotherapy
of the colon, high colonic, entero-lavage, or simply
colonic. It is the process of cleansing the colon by
passing several gallons of water through it with the
use of special equipment. It is similar to an enema but
treats the whole colon, not just the lower bowel. This
has the effect of flushing out impacted fecal matter,
toxins, mucous, and even parasites, that often build up
over the passage of time. It is a procedure that should
only be undertaken by a qualified practitioner.

Purpose
Anyone suffering from gas, bloating, cramping
pains, acne and other skin complaints, arthritis, and a
list of bowel complaints such as diverticulitis and irritable bowel etc., may benefit from colonic irrigation. In
particular, cancer patients are often advised to undertake a course of colonic irrigation sessions as an essential part of their treatment. When a biological cancer
therapy begins to enable the body to breakdown a
cancerous mass, it is essential that speedy and effective
elimination of the resulting toxins is achieved.
Colon and bowel cancer is one of the leading
causes of death in the United States, and alternative
practitioners insist that it can be prevented by efficient
hygiene procedures. Providing that care is taken to
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Removing large amounts of toxic matter relieves
the patient and can lead to the alleviation of symptoms
such as arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, candidiasis,
and a host of other illnesses. Properly executed, colonic irrigation can help restore normal peristaltic action
to a sluggish bowel, thus reducing the need for more
hydrotherapy treatments over time. In addition,
removing the layer of fecal matter which coats the
intestines in many individuals allows improved assimilation of the nutrients from foods and can alleviate
symptoms of vitamin and other nutrient deficiencies.
Many alternative health practitioners consider some
form of hydrotherapy for the bowel to be essential in
the treatment of degenerative diseases.

Description
Origins
Cleansing the colon with the use of hydrotherapy
is not a new concept. Forms of colonic irrigation have
been used successfully for decades to relieve chronic
toxicity and even acute cases of toxemia.
Over time, many people develop a thick layer of
fecal matter that coats their colon. It hardens and
becomes impacted, reducing the efficiency of the
bowel, and in some cases, completely obstructing normal elimination of waste matter from the body. It is
quite common for people to have only one bowel
movement per day, and some as few as one or two
per week.
Alternative practitioners advise that we probably
should have one bowel movement for every meal that
we eat. If not, then we are not eliminating wastes
completely, and if input exceeds output, then we will
surely suffer the consequences at some point.
Incomplete elimination of body wastes may
result in the following, depending on where the
deposits end up:

replace the natural organisms that flourish in the
bowel, many health benefits can be expected from
colonic irrigation. In general, alternative practitioners
maintain that an ill-functioning bowel is the source of
all disease, and therefore keeping it clean will be an
effective protection against this.

During colonic irrigation, a small speculum is
passed into the patient’s bowel through the rectum.
This is attached to a tube, which leads to a machine
that pumps temperature-controlled water into the
colon at a controlled rate (to be controlled by either
the practitioner or the patient). The temperature of the
water should ideally be kept as close to body temperature as possible.
The patient will temporarily be filled with water
up to the level of the entire colon. Patients say they can
feel the water up under their ribs but that the process,
although sometimes uncomfortable, is not painful.
The amount of water will vary but will generally be
in the region of between two and six liters (or quarts)
at any one time. This triggers peristaltic action and the
patient will begin to expel the water along with fecal
matter back through the tube and into the machine.
The fecal matter is flushed out through a viewing
tube, so that what is eliminated may be monitored.
Quite often, unsuspected parasites are expelled, along
with very old fecal material, very dark in color, which
may have been in the colon for years. Some therapists
comment that it looks like aging rubber.
During the treatment, the therapist will gently
massage the patient’s abdomen to help dislodge
impacted fecal matter. In addition to massage, sometimes acupressure, reflexology, or lymphatic drainage
techniques may be used to loosen deposits and stimulate the bowel. It is important that the right amount of
water is used, as too much will cause discomfort and
too little will be ineffective. If correctly done, colonic
irrigation is not painful at all and some patients claim
to sleep through their treatment.
Sanitation is vital to this process. The tubes and
speculums used are generally disposable, but other
parts of the machine, such as the viewing tube, must
be sterilized after each patient.
Normally, a series of treatments will be required
to achieve desired results regarding the elimination of
941

Colonoscopy

impacted, decaying matter, and restoration of bowel
regularity. Initially only gas and recent fecal matter
may be expelled. The residue attached to the colon
wall is usually the result of years of neglect, and therapists say that one cannot expect complete relief in only
one session.
Impacted fecal matter can cause an imbalance of
the natural organisms that normally populate the
bowel, causing what is known as dysbiosis. Under
ideal conditions, the bowel is populated by a variety
of naturally occurring organisms. It seems that the
enzymes occurring in fresh fruit and vegetables encourage these beneficial organisms. One of the results of
eating processed denatured foods is that this natural
balance is upset, and food may begin to rot in the
bowel instead of being processed.
Decomposing matter can cause a toxic condition
and may lead to many health problems, as constipation
causes backed up pollution of the body cells. The
process of repair and elimination of wastes enters a
downward spiral which at best will cause fatigue, lack
of energy and premature aging, and, at worst, can
cause degenerative diseases, among them allergies,
and even cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.
The cost of colonic irrigation treatments varies,
but is generally between $35–70 per session, which
may last from 45 minutes to one hour. The cost of
the machine itself ranges from $4,000–12,000, but
again, it should be noted that only qualified therapists
should conduct sessions.

Preparations
Most practitioners prefer that distilled or purified
water is used for colonic irrigation, but others use
sterilized tap water.

Precautions
It may be advisable to use a probiotic pessary after
colonic irrigation, to ensure replacement of desirable
natural flora. There are certain conditions that either
partly or completely preclude the use of colonic irrigation, such as an active attack of Crohn’s disease, bleeding ulcers, and hyperacidosis. If in doubt, a qualified
practitioner should be consulted. Anyone suffering
from these conditions should always notify the practitioner when receiving colonic irrigation treatments.

Side effects
Some allopathic practitioners claim that colonic
irrigation flushes out essential electrolytes and friendly

Practitioners counter that this can easily be remedied

organisms, and parasites removed from the system.

Research and general acceptance
Although many alternative health care practitioners swear by colonic irrigation, there is a large allopathic lobby that claims that there are no benefits to be
had, and that there are dangers involved. However,
there are many decades of records and research from
the alternative health care community that indicate that
this therapy may have a valuable place in the treatment
of degenerative diseases and toxic conditions.

I Colonoscopy
Definition
Colonoscopy is a medical procedure where a long,
flexible, tubular instrument called the colonoscope is
used to view the entire inner lining of the colon (large
intestine) and the rectum.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

A colonoscopy is generally recommended when the
patient complains of rectal bleeding or has a change in
bowel habits and other unexplained abdominal symptoms. The test is frequently used to test for colorectal
cancer, especially when polyps or tumor-like growths
have been detected using the barium enema and other
diagnostic tests. Polyps can be removed through the
colonoscope and samples of tissue (biopsies) can be
taken to test for the presence of cancerous cells.
The test also enables the physician to check for
bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s
disease. It is a necessary tool in monitoring patients
who have a past history of polyps or colon cancer.

Description
The procedure can be done either in the doctor’s
office or in a special procedure room of a local hospital. An intravenous (IV) line will be started in a vein in
the arm. The patient is generally given a sedative and a
pain-killer through the IV line.
During the colonoscopy, the patient will be asked
to lie on his/her left side with his/her knees drawn up
towards the abdomen. The doctor begins the procedure by inserting a lubricated, gloved finger into the
anus to check for any abnormal masses or blockage. A
thin, well-lubricated colonoscope then will be inserted
into the anus and it will be gently advanced through
the colon. The lining of the intestine will be examined
through the scope. Occasionally air may be pumped
through the colonoscope to help clear the path or open
the colon. If there are excessive secretions, stool, or
blood that obstruct the viewing, they will be suctioned
out through the scope. The doctor may press on the
abdomen or ask the patient to change his/her position
in order to advance the scope through the colon.
The entire length of the large intestine can be examined in this manner. If suspicious growths are observed,
tiny biopsy forceps or brushes can be inserted through
the colon and tissue samples can be obtained. Small
polyps also can be removed through the colonoscope.
After the procedure, the colonoscope is slowly withdrawn and the instilled air is allowed to escape. The
anal area is then cleansed with tissues.
The procedure may take anywhere from 30 minutes
to two hours depending on how easy it is to advance the
scope through the colon. Colonoscopy can be a long
and uncomfortable procedure, and the bowel cleaning
preparation may be tiring and can produce diarrhea and
cramping. During the colonoscopy, the sedative and the
pain medications will keep the patient very drowsy and
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

relaxed. Most patients complain of minor discomfort
and pressure from the colonoscope moving inside.
However, the procedure is not painful.
A procedure called virtual colonoscopy has been
developed but debate continues on whether or not it is
effective as colonoscopy. Virtual colonoscopy refers to
the use of imaging, usually with computed tomography
(CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
to produce images of the colon. Studies in late 2003
showed that virtual colonoscopy was as effective as
colonoscopy for screening purposes and it offered the
advantage of being less invasive and less risky.
However, many physicians were unwilling to accept
it as a replacement for colonoscopy, particularly since
some patients might still require the regular colonoscopy as a follow-up to the virtual procedure if a polyp
or abnormality is found that requires biopsy.

Preparation
The doctor should be notified if the patient has
allergies to any medications or anesthetics; any bleeding problems; or if the woman is pregnant. The doctor
should also be informed of all the medications that the
person is currently on and if he or she has had a
barium x-ray examination recently. If the patient has
had heart valves replaced, the doctor should be
informed so that appropriate antibiotics can be administered to prevent any chance of infection. The risks
of the procedure will be explained to the patient before
performing the procedure and the patient will be asked
to sign a consent form.
It is important that the colon be thoroughly
cleaned before performing the examination. Before
the examination, considerable preparation is necessary to clear the colon of all stool. The patient will be
asked to refrain from eating any solid food for 24–48
hours before the test. Only clear liquids such as juices,
broth, and gelatin are recommended. The patient is
advised to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration.
The evening before the test, the patient will have to
take a strong laxative that the doctor has prescribed.
Several 1 qt enemas of warm tap water may have to be
taken on the morning of the exam. Commercial enemas (e.g., Fleet) may be used.
The patient will be given specific instructions on
how to use the enema and how many such enemas are
necessary. Generally, the procedure has to be repeated
until the return from the enema is clear of stool particles. On the morning of the examination, the patient is
instructed not to eat or drink anything. The preparatory procedures are extremely important since, if the
colon is not thoroughly clean, the exam cannot be done.

Colonoscopy is a procedure where a long and flexible tubular instrument called a colonoscope is inserted into the patient’s
anus in order to view the lining of the colon and rectum. It is performed to test for colorectal cancer and other bowel diseases,
and enables the physician to collect tissue samples for laboratory analysis. (Illustration by Electronic Illustrators Group.)

Aftercare
After the procedure, the patient is kept under
observation until the effects of the medications wear
off. The patient will have to be driven home by someone and can generally resume a normal diet and usual
activities unless otherwise instructed. The patient will
be advised to drink lots of fluids to replace those lost
by laxatives and fasting.
For a few hours after the procedure, the patient
may feel groggy. There may be some abdominal
cramping and considerable amount of gas may be
passed. If a biopsy was performed or a polyp was
removed, there may be small amounts of blood in the
stool for a few days. If the patient experiences severe
abdominal pain or has persistent and heavy bleeding,
it should be brought to the doctor’s attention
immediately.

Risks
The procedure is virtually free of any complications and risks. Very rarely (two in 1000 cases) there
944

may be a perforation (a hole) in the intestinal wall.
Heavy bleeding due to the removal of the polyp or
from the biopsy site seldom occurs (one in 1000 cases).
Infections due to a colonoscopy are also extremely
rare. Patients with artificial or abnormal heart valves
are usually given antibiotics before and after the procedure to prevent an infection.

Normal results
The results are said to be normal if the lining of the
colon is a pale reddish pink and no abnormal looking
masses are found in the lining of the colon.

Abnormal results
Abnormal results would imply that polyps or
other suspicious-looking masses were detected in the
lining of the intestine. Polyps can be removed during
the procedure and tissue samples can be biopsied. If
cancerous cells are detected in the tissue samples, then
a diagnosis of colon cancer is made. The pathologist
analyzes the tumor cells further to estimate the

I Color blindness
Definition
Color blindness is an abnormal condition characterized by the inability to clearly distinguish different
colors of the spectrum. The difficulties can be mild to
severe. It is a misleading term because people with
color blindness are not blind. Rather, they tend to
see colors in a limited range of hues; a rare few may
not see colors at all.

Description
Normal color vision requires the use of specialized
receptor cells called cones, which are located in the
retina of the eye. There are three types of cones,
termed red, blue, and green, which enable people to
see a wide spectrum of colors. An abnormality, or
deficiency, of any of the types of cones will result in
abnormal color vision.
There are three basic variants of color blindness.
Red/green color blindness is the most common deficiency, affecting 8% of Caucasian males and 0.5% of
Caucasian females. The prevalence varies with culture.
Blue color blindness is an inability to distinguish
both blue and yellow, which are seen as white or gray.
It is quite rare and has equal prevalence in males and
females. It is common for young children to have blue/
green confusion that becomes less pronounced in
adulthood. Blue color deficiency often appears in people who have physical disorders such as liver disease or
diabetes mellitus.
A total inability to distinguish colors (achromatopsia) is exceedingly rare. These affected individuals
view the world in shades of gray. They frequently have
poor visual acuity and are extremely sensitive to light
945

(photophobia), which causes them to squint in ordinary light.
Researchers studying red/green color blindness in
the United Kingdom reported an average prevalence of
only 4.7% in one group. Only 1% of Eskimo males are
color blind. Approximately 2.9% of boys from Saudi
Arabia and 3.7% from India were found to have deficient color vision. Red/green color blindness may
slightly increase an affected person’s chances of contracting leprosy. Pre-term infants exhibit an increased
prevalence of blue color blindness. Achromatopsia has
a prevalence of about 1 in 33,000 in the United States
and affects males and females equally.

sickle cell anemia, and retinitis pigmentosa. Accidents
or strokes that damage the retina or affect particular
areas of the brain eye can lead to color blindness.
Some medications such as antibiotics, barbiturates,
anti-tuberculosis drugs, high blood pressure medications, and several medications used to treat nervous
disorders and psychological problems may cause color
blindness. Industrial or environmental chemicals such
as carbon monoxide, carbon disulfide, fertilizers, styrene, and some containing lead can cause loss of color
vision. Occasionally, changes can occur in the affected
person’s capacity to see colors after age 60.

Diagnosis
Causes and symptoms
Red/green and blue color blindness appear to be
located on at least two different gene locations. The
majority of affected individuals are males. Females are
carriers, but are not normally affected. This indicates
that the X chromosome is one of the locations for
color blindness. Male offspring of females who carry
the altered gene have a 50-50 chance of being colorblind. The rare female that has red/green color blindness, or rarer still, blue color blindness, indicates there
is an involvement of another gene. As of 2001, the
location of this gene has not been identified.
Achromatopsia, the complete inability to distinguish color, is an autosomal recessive disease of the
retina. This means that both parents have one copy of
the altered gene but do not have the disease. Each of
their children has a 25% chance of not having the gene,
a 50% chance of having one altered gene (and, like the
parents, being unaffected), and a 25% risk of having
both the altered gene and the condition. In 1997, the
achromatopsia gene was located on chromosome 2.
The inability to correctly identify colors is the only
sign of color blindness. It is important to note that
people with red/green or blue varieties of color blindness use other cues such as color saturation and object
shape or location to distinguish colors. They can often
distinguish red or green if they can visually compare the
colors. However, most have difficulty accurately identifying colors without any other references. Most people with any impairment in color vision learn colors, as
do other young children. These individuals often reach
adolescence before their visual deficiency is identified.
Color blindness is sometimes acquired. Chronic
illnesses that can lead to color blindness include
Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, leukemia, liver disease, chronic alcoholism, macular
degeneration, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease,
946

There are several tests available to identify problems associated with color vision. The most commonly used is the American Optical/Hardy, Rand,
and Ritter Pseudoisochromatic test. It is composed
of several discs filled with colored dots of different
sizes and colors. A person with normal color vision
looking at a test item sees a number that is clearly
located somewhere in the center of a circle of variously
colored dots. A color-blind person is not able to distinguish the number.
The Ishihara test is comprised of eight plates that
are similar to the American Optical Pseudoisochromatic
test plates. The individual being tested looks for numbers among the various colored dots on each test plate.
Some plates distinguish between red/green and blue
color blindness. Individuals with normal color vision
perceive one number. Those with red/green color deficiency see a different number. Those with blue color
vision see yet a different number.
A third analytical tool is the Titmus II Vision
Tester Color Perception test. The subject looks into a
stereoscopic machine. The test stimulus most often
used in professional offices contains six different
designs or numbers on a black background, framed
in a yellow border. Titmus II can test one eye at a time.
However, its value is limited because it can only identify red/green deficiencies and is not highly accurate.

Treatment
There is no treatment or cure for color blindness.
Most color vision deficient persons compensate well
for their abnormality and usually rely on color cues
and details that are not consciously evident to persons
with typical color vision.
Inherited color blindness cannot be prevented. In
the case of some types of acquired color deficiency, if
the cause of the problem is removed, the condition may

Prognosis
Color blindness that is inherited is present in both
eyes and remains constant over an individual’s entire
life. Some cases of acquired color vision loss are not
severe, may appear in only one eye, and last for only a
short time. Other cases tend to be progressive, becoming worse with time.

GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Definition
Ostomy is a surgical procedure used to create an
opening for urine and feces to be released from the
body. Colostomy refers to a surgical procedure where
a portion of the large intestine is brought through the
abdominal wall to carry stool out of the body.

Purpose
A colostomy is created as a means to treat various
disorders of the large intestine, including cancer,
obstruction, inflammatory bowel disease, ruptured
diverticulum, ischemia (compromised blood supply),
or traumatic injury. Temporary colostomies are created to divert stool from injured or diseased portions
of the large intestine, allowing rest and healing.
Permanent colostomies are performed when the distal
bowel (bowel at the farthest distance) must be
removed or is blocked and inoperable. Although colorectal cancer is the most common indication for a
permanent colostomy, only about 10–15% of patients
with this diagnosis require a colostomy.

Description
Surgery will result in one of three types of
colostomies:


End colostomy. The functioning end of the intestine
(the section of bowel that remains connected to the
upper gastrointestinal tract) is brought out onto the
surface of the abdomen, forming the stoma by cuffing
the intestine back on itself and suturing the end to the
skin. A stoma is an artificial opening created to the
surface of the body. The surface of the stoma is actually the lining of the intestine, usually appearing moist
and pink. The distal portion of bowel (now connected

only to the rectum) may be removed, or sutured closed
and left in the abdomen. An end colostomy is usually
a permanent ostomy, resulting from trauma, cancer or
another pathological condition.


Double–barrel colostomy. This colostomy involves
the creation of two separate stomas on the abdominal
wall. The proximal (nearest) stoma is the functional
end that is connected to the upper gastrointestinal
tract and will drain stool. The distal stoma, connected
to the rectum and also called a mucous fistula, drains
small amounts of mucus material. This is most often a
temporary colostomy performed to rest an area of
bowel, and to be later closed.



Loop colostomy. This colostomy is created by bringing a loop of bowel through an incision in the
abdominal wall. The loop is held in place outside
the abdomen by a plastic rod slipped beneath it. An
incision is made in the bowel to allow the passage of
stool through the loop colostomy. The supporting
rod is removed approximately 7–10 days after surgery, when healing has occurred that will prevent the
loop of bowel from retracting into the abdomen. A
loop colostomy is most often performed for creation
of a temporary stoma to divert stool away from an
area of intestine that has been blocked or ruptured.

Preparation
As with any surgical procedure, the patient will be
required to sign a consent form after the procedure is
explained thoroughly. Blood and urine studies, along
with various x rays and an electrocardiograph (EKG),
may be ordered as the doctor deems necessary. If
possible, the patient should visit an enterostomal
therapist, who will mark an appropriate place on the
abdomen for the stoma, and offer pre-operative education on ostomy management.
In order to empty and cleanse the bowel, the
patient may be placed on a low residue diet for several
days prior to surgery. A liquid diet may be ordered for
at least the day before surgery, with nothing by mouth
after midnight. A series of enemas and/or oral preparations (GoLytely or Colyte) may be ordered to empty the
bowel of stool. Oral anti-infectives (neomycin, erythromycin, or kanamycin sulfate) may be ordered to
decrease bacteria in the intestine and help prevent
post-operative infection. A nasogastric tube is inserted
from the nose to the stomach on the day of surgery or
during surgery to remove gastric secretions and prevent
nausea and vomiting. A urinary catheter (a thin plastic
tube) may also be inserted to keep the bladder empty
during surgery, giving more space in the surgical field
and decreasing chances of accidental injury.
948

Aftercare
Post-operative care for the patient with a new
colostomy, as with those who have had any major
surgery, involves monitoring of blood pressure,
pulse, respirations, and temperature. Breathing tends
to be shallow because of the effect of anesthesia and
the patient’s reluctance to breathe deeply and experience pain that is caused by the abdominal incision. The
patient is instructed how to support the operative site
during deep breathing and coughing, and given pain
medication as necessary. Fluid intake and output is
measured, and the operative site is observed for color
and amount of wound drainage. The nasogastric tube
will remain in place, attached to low intermittent suction until bowel activity resumes. For the first 24–48
hours after surgery, the colostomy will drain bloody
mucus. Fluids and electrolytes are infused intravenously until the patient’s diet is can gradually be
resumed, beginning with liquids. Usually within
72 hours, passage of gas and stool through the stoma
begins. Initially the stool is liquid, gradually thickening as the patient begins to take solid foods. The
patient is usually out of bed in 8–24 hours after surgery
and discharged in 2–4 days.
A colostomy pouch will generally have been
placed on the patient’s abdomen, around the stoma
during surgery. During the hospital stay, the patient
and his or her caregivers will be educated on how to
care for the colostomy. Determination of appropriate
pouching supplies and a schedule of how often to
change the pouch should be established. Regular
assessment and meticulous care of the skin surrounding the stoma is important to maintain an adequate
surface on which to apply the pouch. Some patients
with colostomies are able to routinely irrigate the
stoma, resulting in regulation of bowel function;
rather than needing to wear a pouch, these patients
may need only a dressing or cap over their stoma.
Often, an enterostomal therapist will visit the patient
at home after discharge to help with the patient’s
resumption of normal daily activities.

Stomal complications to be monitored include:



Death (necrosis) of stomal tissue. Caused by inadequate blood supply, this complication is usually visible 12–24 hours after the operation and may require
additional surgery.



Retraction (stoma is flush with the abdomen surface
or has moved below it). Caused by insufficient stomal length, this complication may be managed by use
of special pouching supplies. Elective revision of the
stoma is also an option.

Colposcopy

KEY TERMS
Diverticulum—Pouches that project off the wall of
the intestine, visible as opaque on an x ray after the
patient has swallowed a contrast (dye) substance.
Embolism—Blockage of a blood vessel by any small
piece of material traveling in the blood. The emboli
may be caused by germs, air, blood clots, or fat.
Enema—Insertion of a tube into the rectum to
infuse fluid into the bowel and encourage a bowel
movement. Ordinary enemas contain tap water,
mixtures of soap and water, glycerine and water,
or other materials.
Intestine—Commonly called the bowels, divided
into the small and large intestine. They extend from
the stomach to the anus. The small intestine is
about 20 ft (6 m) long. The large intestine is about
5 ft (1.5 m) long.
Ischemia—A compromise in blood supply delivered
to body tissues that causes tissue damage or death.
Ostomy—A surgically created opening in the abdomen for elimination of waste products (urine or stool).



Prolapse (stoma increases length above the surface of
the abdomen). Most often results from an overly large
opening in the abdominal wall or inadequate fixation
of the bowel to the abdominal wall. Surgical correction is required when blood supply is compromised.



Stenosis (narrowing at the opening of the stoma).
Often associated with infection around the stoma
or scarring. Mild stenosis can be removed under
local anesthesia. Severe stenosis may require surgery
for reshaping the stoma.



Parastomal hernia (bowel causing bulge in the
abdominal wall next to the stoma). This is due to
placement of the stoma where the abdominal wall is
weak or creation of an overly large opening in the
abdominal wall. The use of an ostomy support belt
and special pouching supplies may be adequate. If
severe, the defect in the abdominal wall should be
repaired and the stoma moved to another location.

I Colposcopy
Definition
Colposcopy is a procedure that allows a physician
to take a closer look at a woman’s cervix and vagina
using a special instrument called a colposcope. It is
used to check for precancerous or abnormal areas.
The colposcope can magnify the area between 10 and
40 times; some devices also can take photographs.

Purpose
The colposcope helps to identify abnormal areas
of the cervix or vagina so that small pieces of tissue
(biopsies) can be taken for further analysis.
Colposcopy is used to identify or rule out the existence of any precancerous conditions in the cervical
tissue. If a Pap test shows abnormal cell growth, further
testing, such as colposcopy, often is required. A Pap test
is a screening test that involves scraping cells from the
outside of the cervix. If abnormal cells are found, the
physician will attempt to find the area that produced
the abnormal cells and remove it for further study
(biopsy). Only then can a diagnosis be made.
Colposcopy may also be performed if the cervix
looks abnormal during a routine examination. It may
also be suggested for women with genital warts and for
diethylstilbestrol (DES) daughters (women whose
mothers took DES when pregnant with them).

Precautions
Women who are pregnant, or who suspect that
they are pregnant, must tell their doctor before the
procedure begins. Pregnant women can, and should,
have a colposcopy if they have an abnormal Pap test.
However, special precautions must be taken during
biopsy of the cervix.

Description
A colposcopy is performed in a physician’s office
and is similar to a regular gynecologic exam. An
instrument called a speculum is used to hold the
vagina open, and the gynecologist looks at the cervix
and vagina through the colposcope instead simply by
eye, as in a routine examination.
The colposcope is placed outside the patient’s body
and never touches the skin. The cervix and vagina are
swabbed with dilute acetic acid (vinegar). The solution
highlights abnormal areas by turning them white
(instead of a normal pink color). Abnormal areas can
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

If any abnormal areas are seen, the doctor will
take a biopsy of the tissue, a common procedure that
takes about 15 minutes. Several samples might be
taken, depending on the size of the abnormal area.
A biopsy may cause temporary discomfort and cramping, which usually go away within a few minutes. If the
abnormal area appears to extend inside the cervical
canal, a scraping of the canal may be done. The biopsy
results are usually available within a week.
If the tissue sample indicates abnormal growth
(dysplasia) or precancer, and if the entire abnormal
area can be seen, the doctor can destroy the tissue
using one of several procedures, including ones that
use high heat (diathermy), extreme cold (cryotherapy),
or lasers. Another procedure, called a loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP), uses low-voltage high-frequency
radio waves to excise tissue. If any of the abnormal
tissue is within the cervical canal, a cone biopsy
(removal of a conical section of the cervix for inspection) will be needed.

Colposcopy

also be identified by looking for a characteristic pattern
made by abnormal blood vessels. In 2004, a study
showed that a new optical detection system used with
colposcopy greatly improved visual detection of precancerous changes in the cervix during the procedure.

A colposcopy makes it possible for a physician to view this
healthy cervix without surgery. (Photograph by Dr. P. Marazzi,
Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)

Preparation
Colposcopy is a painless procedure that does not
require any anesthetic medication. If a biopsy is done,
there may be mild cramps or a sharp pinching when the
tissue is removed. To lessen this pain, your doctor may
recommend 800 mg of ibuprofen (Motrin) taken the
night before and the morning of the procedure (no later
than 30 minutes before the appointment). Patients who
are pregnant or allergic to aspirin or ibuprofen can take
two tablets of acetaminophen (Tylenol) instead.

Aftercare
If a biopsy was done, there may be a dark vaginal
discharge afterwards. After the sample is removed, the
doctor applies Monsel’s solution to the area to stop
the bleeding. When this mixes with blood it creates a
black fluid that looks like coffee grounds for a couple
of days after the procedure. It is also normal to have
some spotting after a colposcopy.
Patients should not use tampons or put anything
else in the vagina for at least a week after the procedure, or until the doctor says it is safe. In addition,
women should not have sex or douche for at least a
week after the procedure because of the risk of
infection.

topical medication.

an hour)

I Coma
Definition
Coma, from the Greek word ‘‘koma,’’ meaning
deep sleep, is a state of extreme unresponsiveness, in
which an individual exhibits no voluntary movement
or behavior. Furthermore, in a deep coma, even painful stimuli (actions which, when performed on a
healthy individual, result in reactions) are unable to
affect any response, and normal reflexes may be lost.

Description
Coma lies on a spectrum with other alterations in
consciousness. The level of consciousness required by,
for example, someone reading this passage lies at one
extreme end of the spectrum, while complete brain
death lies at the other end of the spectrum. In between
are such states as obtundation, drowsiness, and stupor. All of these are conditions which, unlike coma,
still allow the individual to respond to stimuli,
although such a response may be brief and require
stimulus of greater than normal intensity.
In order to understand the loss of function suffered by a comatose individual, it is necessary to first
understand the important characteristics of the conscious state. Consciousness is defined by two fundamental elements: awareness and arousal.
Awareness allows one to receive and process all
the information communicated by the five senses, and
thus relate to oneself and to the outside world.
Awareness has both psychological and physiological
components. The psychological component is governed by an individual’s mind and mental processes.
The physiological component refers to the functioning
of an individual’s brain, and therefore that brain’s
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Arousal is regulated solely by physiological functioning and consists of more primitive responsiveness to
the world, as demonstrated by predictable reflex (involuntary) responses to stimuli. Arousal is maintained by
the reticular activating system (RAS). This is not an
anatomical area of the brain, but rather a network of
structures (including the brainstem, the medulla, and
the thalamus) and nerve pathways, which function
together to produce and maintain arousal.

Causes and symptoms
Coma, then, is the result of something that interferes
with the functioning of the cerebral cortex and/or the
functioning of the structures which make up the RAS. In
fact, a huge and varied number of conditions can result
in coma. A good way of categorizing these conditions is
to consider the anatomic and the metabolic causes of
coma. Anatomic causes of coma are those conditions
that disrupt the normal physical architecture of the brain
structures responsible for consciousness, either at the
level of the cerebal cortex or the brainstem, while metabolic causes of coma consist of those conditions that
change the chemical environment of the brain, thereby
adversely affecting function.
There are many metabolic causes of coma,
including:


A decrease in the delivery to the brain of substances
necessary for appropriate brain functioning, such as
oxygen, glucose (sugar), and sodium.



The presence of certain substances that disrupt the
functioning of neurons. Drugs or alcohol in toxic
quantities can result in neuronal dysfunction, as can
substances normally found in the body, but that, due
to some diseased state, accumulate at toxic levels.
Accumulated substances that might cause coma
include ammonia due to liver disease, ketones due
to uncontrolled diabetes, or carbon dioxide due to a
severe asthma attack.



The changes in chemical levels in the brain due to the
electrical derangements caused by seizures.

Diagnosis
As in any neurologic condition, history and examination form the cornerstone of diagnosis when the
patient is in a coma; however, history must be
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

obtained from family, friends, or EMS. The Glasgow
Coma Scale is a system of examining a comatose
patient. It is helpful for evaluating the depth of the
coma, tracking the patient’s progress, and predicting
(somewhat) the ultimate outcome of the coma. The
Glasgow Coma Scale assigns a different number of
points for exam results in three different categories:
opening the eyes, verbal response (using words or
voice to respond), and motor response (moving a
part of the body). Fifteen is the largest possible number of total points, indicating the highest level of functioning. The highest level of functioning would be
demonstrated by an individual who spontaneously
opens his/her eyes, gives appropriate answers to questions about his/her situation, and can carry out a
command (such as ‘‘move your leg’’ or ‘‘nod your
head’’). Three is the least possible number of total
points and would be given to a patient for whom not
even a painful stimulus is sufficient to provoke a
response. In the middle are those patients who may
be able to respond, but who require an intense or
painful stimulus, and whose response may demonstrate some degree of brain malfunctioning (such as a
person whose only response to pain in a limb is to bend
that limb in toward the body). When performed as
part of the admission examination, a Glasgow score
of three to five points often suggests that the patient
has likely suffered fatal brain damage, while eight or
more points indicates that the patient’s chances for
recovery are good. Expansion of the pupils and
respiratory pattern are also important. Metabolic
causes of coma are diagnosed from blood work and
urinalysis to evaluate blood chemistry, drug screen,
and blood cell abnormalities that may indicate infection. Anatomic causes of coma are diagnosed from
CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans.

Treatment
Coma is a medical emergency, and attention must
first be directed to maintaining the patient’s respiration and circulation, using intubation aand ventilation, administration of intravenous fluids or blood as
needed, and other supportive care. If head trama has
not been excluded, the neck should be stablized in the
event of fracture. It is obviously extremely important
for a physician to determine quickly the cause of a
coma, so that potentially reversible conditions are
treated immediately. For example, an infection may
be treated with antibiotics; a brain tumor may be
removed; and brain swelling from an injury can be
reduced with certain medications. Various metabolic
disorders can be addressed by supplying the individual

states in which the individual loses all ability to function and remains deeply unresponsive. An individual
who has suffered such a severe brain injury may

Prognosis
Some conditions that cause coma can be completely reversed, restoring the individual to his or her
original level of functioning. However, if areas of the
brain have been sufficiently damaged due to the severity or duration of the condition which led to the coma,
the individual may recover from the coma with permanent disabilities, or may even never regain consciousness. Take, for example, the situation of
someone whose coma was caused by brain injury in a
car accident. Such an injury can result in one of three
outcomes. In the event of a less severe brain injury,
with minimal swelling, an individual may indeed
recover consciousness and regain all of his or her
original abilities. In the event of a more severe brain
injury, with swelling that resulted in further pressure

Anyone can get a cold, although pre-school and

Although most colds resolve on their own without

cold (a person has to come in contact with the virus to
catch a cold), certain conditions may lead to increased
susceptibility. These include:


fatigue and overwork



emotional stress



poor nutrition



smoking



living or working in crowded conditions

Colds make the upper respiratory system less
resistant to bacterial infection. Secondary bacterial
infection may lead to middle ear infection, bronchitis,
pneumonia, sinus infection, or strep throat. People with
chronic lung disease, asthma, diabetes, or a weakened
immune system are more likely to develop these
complications.

eyes, the virus is transferred to an environment where
it can reproduce and cause a cold.
Finally, cold viruses can be spread through inanimate objects (door knobs, telephones, toys) that
become contaminated with the virus. This is a common method of transmission in child care centers. If a
child with a cold touches her runny nose, then plays
with a toy, some of the virus may be transferred to the
toy. When another child plays with the toy a short time
later, he may pick up some of the virus on his hands.
The second child then touches his contaminated hands
to his eyes, nose, or mouth and transfers some of the
cold virus to himself.
Once acquired, the cold virus attaches itself to the
lining of the nasal passages and sinuses. This causes
the infected cells to release a chemical called histamine.
Histamine increases the blood flow to the infected
cells, causing swelling, congestion, and increased
mucus production. Within one to three days the
infected person begins to show cold symptoms.

Colds are caused by more than 200 different
viruses. The most common groups are rhinoviruses
and coronaviruses. Different groups of viruses are
more infectious at different seasons of the year, but
knowing the exact virus causing the cold is not important in treatment.

The first cold symptoms are a tickle in the throat,
runny nose, and sneezing. The initial discharge from
the nose is clear and thin. Later it changes to a thick
yellow or greenish discharge. Most adults do not
develop a fever when they catch a cold. Young children may develop a low fever of up to 102  F (38.9  C).

People with colds are contagious during the first
two to four days of the infection. Colds pass from
person to person in several ways. When an infected
person coughs, sneezes, or speaks, tiny fluid droplets
containing the virus are expelled. If these are breathed
in by other people, the virus may establish itself in
their noses and airways.

In addition to a runny nose and fever, signs of
a cold include coughing, sneezing, nasal congestion,
headache, muscle ache, chills, sore throat, hoarseness,
watery eyes, tiredness, and lack of appetite. The cough
that accompanies a cold is usually intermittent and dry.

Colds may also be passed through direct contact.
If a person with a cold touches his runny nose or
watery eyes, then shakes hands with another person
some of the virus is transferred to the uninfected person. If that person then touches his mouth, nose, or

Most people begin to feel better four to five days
after their cold symptoms become noticeable. All
symptoms are generally gone within ten days, except
for a dry cough that may linger for up to three weeks.
Colds make people more susceptible to bacterial
infections such as strep throat, middle ear infections,
and sinus infections. A person whose cold does not
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

People who have emphysema, chronic lung disease, diabetes, or a weakened immune system — either
from diseases such as AIDS or leukemia, or as the
result of medications, (corticosteroids, chemotherapy
drugs)—should consult their doctor if they get a
cold. People with these health problems are more
likely to get a secondary infection.

Diagnosis
Colds are diagnosed by observing a person’s
symptoms. There are no laboratory tests readily available to detect the cold virus. However, a doctor may
do a throat culture or blood test to rule out a secondary
infection.
Influenza is sometimes confused with a cold, but
flu causes much more severe symptoms and generally a
fever. Allergies to molds or pollens also can make the
nose run. Allergies are usually more persistent than the
common cold. An allergist can do tests to determine if
the cold-like symptoms are being caused by an allergic
reaction. Also, some people get a runny nose when
they go outside in winter and breathe cold air. This
type of runny nose is not a symptom of a cold.

Treatment
There are no medicines that will cure the common
cold. Given time, the body’s immune system will make
antibodies to fight the infection, and the cold will be
resolved without any intervention. Antibiotics are useless against a cold. However, a great deal of money is
spent by pharmaceutical companies in the United
States promoting products designed to relieve cold
symptoms. These products usually contain antihistamines, decongestants, and/or pain relievers.
Antihistamines block the action of the chemical
histamine that is produced when the cold virus
invades the cells lining the nasal passages.
Histamine increases blood flow and causes the cells
to swell. Antihistamines are taken to relieve the
symptoms of sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, and
congestion. Side effects are dry mouth and drowsiness, especially with the first few doses.
Antihistamines should not be taken by people who
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

are driving or operating dangerous equipment. Some
people have allergic reactions to antihistamines.
Common over-the-counter antihistamines include
Chlor-Trimeton, Dimetapp, Tavist, and Actifed.
The generic name for two common antihistamines
are chlorpheniramine and diphenhydramine.
Decongestants work to constrict the blood flow to
the vessels in the nose. This can shrink the tissue,
reduce congestion, and open inflamed nasal passages,
making breathing easier. Decongestants can make
people feel jittery or keep them from sleeping. They
should not be used by people with heart disease, high
blood pressure, or glaucoma. Some common decongestants are Neo-Synepherine, Novafed, and Sudafed.
The generic names of common decongestants include
phenylephrine, phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine, and in nasal sprays naphazoline, oxymetazoline
and xylometazoline.
Many over-the-counter medications are combinations of both antihistamines and decongestants; an
ache and pain reliever, such as acetaminophen
(Datril, Tylenol, Panadol) or ibuprofen (Advil,
Nuprin, Motrin, Medipren); and a cough suppressant
(dextromethorphan). Common combination medications include Tylenol Cold and Flu, Triaminic,
Sudafed Plus, and Tavist D. Aspirin should not be
given to children with a cold because of its association
with a risk of Reye’s syndrome, a serious disease.
Nasal sprays and nose drops are other products
promoted for reducing nasal congestion. These
usually contain a decongestant, but the decongestant
can act more quickly and strongly than ones found in
pills or liquids because it is applied directly in the nose.
Congestion returns after a few hours.
People can become dependent on nasal sprays and
nose drops. If used for a long time, users may suffer
withdrawal symptoms when these products are discontinued. Nasal sprays and nose drops should not
be used for more than a few days. The label lists
recommendations on length and frequency of use.
Scientists reported in 2004 the possibility of a new
oral drug for use in relieving common cold symptoms.
Called pleconaril, it inhibited viral replication in at
least 90% of rhinoviruses if taken within 24 hours of
onset.
People react differently to different cold medications and may find some more helpful than others. A
medication may be effective initially, then lose some of
its effectiveness. Children sometimes react differently
than adults. Over-the-counter cold remedies should
not be given to infants without consulting a doctor
first.

The use of zinc lozenges every two hours along with
high doses of vitamin C is suggested. Some practitioners also suggest eliminating dairy products for
the duration of the cold. (Nutritional therapy).

In addition to the optional use of over the counter
cold remedies, there are some self-care steps that people can take to ease their discomfort. These include:


drinking plenty of fluids, but avoiding acidic juices,
which may irritate the throat



gargling with warm salt water — made by adding one
teaspoon of salt to 8 oz of water — for a sore throat





for babies too young to blow their noses, the mucus
should be suctioned gently with an infant nasal
aspirator. It may be necessary to soften the mucus
first with a few drops of salt water.

The use of zinc lozenges may be moving toward
acceptance by practitioners of traditional medicine. In
1996 the Cleveland Clinic tested zinc gluconate
lozenges and found using zinc in the first 24 hours
after cold symptoms occurred shortened the duration
of symptoms. The mechanism by which zinc worked
was not clear, but additional studies are underway.
At one time, the herb (Echinacea spp.) was touted
as a remedy to relieve cold symptoms. However, a
study published in 2004 reported that the herb failed
to relieve cold symptoms in 400 children taking it and
caused skin rashes in some children.

Alternative treatment
Alternative practitioners emphasize that people
get colds because their immune systems are weak.
They point out that everyone is exposed to cold
viruses, but not everyone gets every cold. The difference seems to be in the ability of the immune system to
fight infection. Prevention focuses on strengthening
the immune system by eating a healthy diet low in
sugars and high in fresh fruits and vegetables, practicing meditation to reduce stress, and getting regular
moderate exercise.
Once cold symptoms appear, some naturopathic
practitioners believe the symptoms should be allowed
to run their course without interference. Others suggest the following:

oil, eucalyptus, and tea tree oil (Melaleuca spp.).

bayberry to ease a sore throat. (Ayurvedic medicine)

958

Prognosis
Given time, the body will make antibodies to cure
itself of a cold. Most colds last a week to 10 days. Most
people start feeling better within four or five days.
Occasionally a cold will lead to a secondary bacterial
infection that causes strep throat, bronchitis, pneumonia, sinus infection, or a middle ear infection. These
conditions usually clear up rapidly when treated with
an antibiotic.

Prevention
It is not possible to prevent colds because the
viruses that cause colds are common and highly infectious. However, there are some steps individuals can
take to reduce their spread. These include:

washing hands well and frequently, especially after
touching the nose or before handling food

Immunodeficiency means that the immune system
is deficient in one or more of its components and is
unable to respond effectively. Common variable
immunodeficiency is the most common of the immunodeficiency disorders. Patients with this disease have
frequent infections, especially those caused by the
same microorganism. Recurring infections are an indication that the immune system is not responding
normally and developing immunity to reinfection.
Patients with common variable immunodeficiency
have a normal number of B cells, the lymphocytes
that make antibodies. In approximately one-third of
these patients, the number of B cells in the blood that
have IgG antibodies on their surface is lower than
normal, but there are normal numbers of B cells in
their bone marrow. B cells with IgG antibodies on
their surface are capable of responding to microorganisms. The lack of IgG on the surface of the B cells
means that they are not prepared to fight infection.
The T-cell lymphocytes, those cells responsible for
cellular immunity, are usually normal, although
some cell signal components may be lacking.

Causes and symptoms
The cause of common variable immunodeficiency
is not known, although some forms seem to be hereditary. The main symptom is recurring infections that
tend to be chronic rather than acute. Patients may also
develop diarrhea and, as a consequence of the diarrhea, do not absorb food efficiently. This can lead to
malnourishment that can aggravate the disorder.
Common variable immunodeficiency normally
appears in children after the age of 10. Autoimmune
disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, thyroiditis, and
systemic lupus erythematosus and certain cancers such
as lymphomas and leukemias may be associated with
common variable immunodeficiency.

Definition
Common variable immunodeficiency is an immunodeficiency disorder characterized by a low level of
antibodies. Patients with this disease are subject to
recurring infections.
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

As is true of most immunodeficiency disorders, one
of the first signs that the patient has the condition is
recurrent infections. Patients with common variable
immunodeficiency are subject to recurrent infections,
especially those caused by microbes that don’t normally
cause disease in normal persons. The main diagnostic
test that distinguishes common variable immunodeficiency from other immunodeficiency diseases is the low
antibody level despite the normal number of B cells.
Antibody levels are tested in the serum by a procedure
called electrophoresis. This procedure both quantifies

Complement deficiencies

the amount of antibody present and identifies the various classes of antibodies. The main class of antibody
for fighting infectious diseases is IgG.

Treatment
There is no treatment that will cure the disorder.
Treatment for common variable immunodeficiency
aims at boosting the body’s immune response and preventing or controlling infections. Immune serum,
obtained from donated blood, is given as a source of
antibodies to boost the immune response. Immune
serum is obtained from donated blood. It contains
whatever antibodies the donors had in their blood.
Consequently, it may not contain all the antibodies
that the patient needs and may lack antibodies specific
for some of the recurring infections that these patients
suffer. Antibiotics are used routinely at the first sign of
an infection to help the patient eliminate infectious
microorganisms.

Prognosis
With good medical care, people with common
variable immunodeficiency usually have a normal life
span.

Prevention
The disease itself cannot be prevented, but
patients and their families can take precautions to
prevent the recurrent infections commonly associated
with it. For example, good hygiene and nutrition are
important, as is avoiding crowds or other people who
have active infections.

Complement plays several functions in immunity.
It can poke holes in bacteria, kill bacteria that are first
targeted by antibodies, or, working with antibodies,
point out which bacteria need to be engulfed by white
blood cells. Without sufficient complement, the body
is prone to frequent infections, like pneumonia or
meningitis, or other illnesses, including autoimmune
diseases, like systemic lupus erythematosus. Since there
are more than 20 different types of complement, the
disease that results depends on the specific complement that is lacking.

Cause and symptoms
A defect in the complement system can be genetic,
but a secondary complement deficiency can also result
from ailments that involve a lot of protein loss, including serious burns, liver or kidney disease, and autoimmune diseases, like lupus. Symptoms vary depending
on the specific complement deficiency and the disease
that results. Some people remain healthy with no
symptoms at all. Others, who suffer from frequent
infections, may develop a high fever, diarrhea, headaches with a stiff neck, or a cough with chest pain. If an
autoimmune disease develops, like lupus, the person
may lose weight, suffer from a rash, and have joint
pain. Other symptoms of complement deficiency
diseases (like hereditary angioedema, paroxysmal
nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or leukocyte adhesion
deficiency syndrome) include abdominal and back
pain, skin infections, edema or swelling of the face
and red bumps on the skin.

I Complement deficiencies
Definition
Complement deficiencies are a group of disorders
in which there is a reduced level of specific proteins,
complement, involved in proper immune functioning.
960

Description

There are blood tests which determine the activity
of the complement system. The two most common
screening tests, CH50 and APH50, tell the physician
which group of complement components have a
defect. More specific blood tests for the individual
complement components (e.g., C3 or C4 complement)
are then performed. Other specialized blood tests,
including C1 esterase level, Ham test, and a white
blood count, may also be performed.

Treatment
There is no way to treat the actual complement
deficiency. However, antibiotics are used to treat infections and vaccinations are given to reduce the risk of
disease. Often, the person is vaccinated against infections that include influenza, pneumonia, and meningitis. In some cases, (e.g. a specific disease called

I Computed tomography scans
Definition
Computed tomography (CT) scans are completed
with the use of a 360-degree x-ray beam and computer
production of images. These scans allow for crosssectional views of body organs and tissues.

Purpose
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [NH]) a bone
marrow transplant may be recommended.

Alternative treatment
There is no alternative treatment for complement
problems.

CT scans are used to image a wide variety of body
structures and internal organs. Since the 1990s, CT
equipment has become more affordable and available.
In some diagnoses, CT scans have become the first
imaging exam of choice. Because the computerized
image is so sharp, focused, and three-dimensional,
many tissues can be better differentiated than on standard x rays. Common CT indications include:


Sinus studies. The CT scan can show details of a
sinusitis, and bone fractures. Physicians may order
CT of the sinuses to provide an accurate map for
surgery.



Brain studies. Brain scans can detect hematomas,
tumors, and strokes. The introduction of CT scanning, especially spiral CT, has helped reduce the need
for more invasive procedures such as cerebral
angiography.

Prognosis
Since complement deficiencies include a wide
range of disorders, the prognoses can also vary widely.
Some patients remain healthy their entire life. Others
are hospitalized frequently because of infections
which, if not properly treated, can be fatal. Those
with autoimmune diseases could have a normal life
expectancy. There are some complement deficiencies,

Computed tomography scans

KEY TERMS

Computed tomography scans



Body scans. CT scans of the body will often be used
to observe abdominal organs, such as the liver, kidneys, adrenal glands, spleen, and lymph nodes, and
extremities.



Aorta scans. CT scans can focus on the thoracic or
abdominal aorta to locate aneurysms and other possible aortic diseases.



Chest scans. CT scans of the chest are useful in
distinguishing tumors and in detailing accumulation
of fluid in chest infections.

Precautions
Pregnant women or those who could possibly be
pregnant should not have a CT scan unless the diagnostic benefits outweigh the risks. Pregnant patients
should particularly avoid full body or abdominal
scans. If the exam is necessary for obstetrics purposes,
technologists are instructed not to repeat films if there
are errors. Pregnant patients receiving CT or any x-ray
exam away from the abdominal area may be protected
by a lead apron; most radiation, known as scatter,
travels through the body and is not blocked by the
apron.
Contrast agents are often used in CT exams and
the use of these agents should be discussed with the
medical professional prior to the procedure. Patients
should be asked to sign a consent form concerning
the administration of contrast. One of the common
contrast agents, iodine, can cause allergic reactions.
Patients who are known to be allergic to iodine
(or shellfish) should inform the physician prior to the
CT scan.

Description
Computed tomography, also called CT scan,
CAT scan, or computerized axial tomography, is a
combination of focused x-ray beams and computerized production of an image. Introduced in the early
1970s, this radiologic procedure has advanced rapidly
and is now widely used, sometimes in the place of
standard x rays.
CT equipment
A CT scan may be performed in a hospital or
outpatient imaging center. Although the equipment
looks large and intimidating, it is very sophisticated
and fairly comfortable. The patient is asked to lie on a
gantry, or narrow table, that slides into the center of
the scanner. The scanner looks like a doughnut and is
round in the middle, which allows the x-ray beam to
962

rotate around the patient. The scanner section may
also be tilted slightly to allow for certain cross-sectional angles.
CT procedure
The patient will feel the gantry move very slightly
as the precise adjustments for each sectional image are
made. A technologist watches the procedure from a
window and views the images on a computer screen.
It is essential that the patient lie very still during
the procedure to prevent motion blurring. In some
studies, such as chest CTs, the patient will be asked
to hold his or her breath during image capture.
Following the procedure, films of the images are
usually printed for the radiologist and referring physician to review. A radiologist can also interpret CT
exams on a special computer screen. The procedure
time will vary in length depending on the area being
imaged. Average study times are from 30 to 60 minutes. Some patients may be concerned about claustrophobia, but the width of the ‘‘doughnut’’ portion of
the scanner is such that many patients can be reassured
of openness.
The CT image
While traditional x rays image organs in two
dimensions, with the possibility that organs in the
front of the body are superimposed over those in the
back, CT scans allow for a more three-dimensional
effect. Some have compared CT images to slices in a
loaf of bread. Precise sections of the body can be
located and imaged as cross-sectional views. The
screen before the technologist shows a computer’s
analysis of each section detected by the x-ray beam.
Thus, various densities of tissue can be easily
distinguished.
Contrast agents
Contrast agents are often used in CT exams and in
other radiology procedures to illuminate certain
details of anatomy which may not be easily seen.
Some contrasts are natural, such as air or water.
Other times, a water-based contrast agent is administered for specific diagnostic purposes. Barium sulfate
is commonly used in gastroenterology procedures.
The patient may drink this contrast, or receive it in
an enema. Oral and rectal contrast are usually given
when examining the abdomen or cells, and not given
when scanning the brain or chest. Iodine is the most
widely used intravenous contrast agent and is given
through an intravenous needle.

Some facilities will have both spiral and conventional CT available. Although spiral is more advantageous for many applications, conventional CT is
still a superior and precise method for imaging many
tissues and structures. The physician will evaluate
which type of CT works best for the specific exam
purpose.

Preparation
If a contrast medium is administered, the patient
may be asked to fast from about four to six hours prior
to the procedure. Patients will usually be given a gown
(like a typical hospital gown) to be worn during the
procedure. All metal and jewelry should be removed to
avoid artifacts on the film.

Aftercare

CT scan of facial sinuses. (Pascal Goetgheluck. Photo
Researchers. Reproduced by permission.)

If contrast agents are used in the CT exam, these
will be administered several minutes before the study
begins. Abdominal CT patients may be asked to
drink a contrast medium. Some patients may experience a salty taste, flushing of the face, warmth or
slight nausea, or hives from an intravenous contrast
injection. Technologists and radiologists have
equipment and training to help patients through
these minor reactions and to handle more severe
reactions. Severe reactions to contrast are rare, but
do occur.

No aftercare is generally required following a CT
scan. Immediately following the exam, the technologist will continue to watch the patient for possible
adverse contrast reactions. Patients are instructed to
advise the technologist of any symptoms, particularly
respiratory difficulty. The site of contrast injection will
be bandaged and may feel tender following the exam.
Hives may develop later and usually do not require
treatment.

Risks
Radiation exposure from a CT scan is similar to,
though higher than, that of a conventional x ray.
Although this is a risk to pregnant women, the exposure to other adults is minimal and should produce no
effects. Although severe contrast reactions are rare,
they are a risk of many CT procedures.

Spiral CT
Spiral CT, also called helical CT, is a newer
version of CT scanning which is continuous in
motion and allows for three-dimensional recreation
of images. For example, traditional CT allows the

technologist to take slices at very small and precise
intervals one after the other. Spiral CT allows for a
continuous flow of images, without stopping the
scanner to move to the next image slice. A major
advantage of spiral CT is the ability to reconstruct
images anywhere along the length of the study area.
The procedure also speeds up the imaging process,
meaning less time for the patient to lie still. The
ability to image contrast more rapidly after it is
injected, when it is at its highest level, is another
advantage of spiral CT’s high speed.

or black. Air will also look black. Intravenous, oral,
and rectal contrast appear as white areas. The radiologist can determine if tissues and organs appear
normal by the sensitivity of the gray shadows. In CT,
the images that can cut through a section of tissue or
organ provide three-dimensional viewing for the radiologist and referring physician.

Abnormal results
Abnormal results may show different characteristics of tissues within organs. Accumulations of blood
or other fluids where they do not belong may be
detected. Radiologists can differentiate among types
of tumors throughout the body by viewing details of
their makeup.
Sinus studies
The increasing availability and lowered cost of CT
scanning has led to its increased use in sinus studies,
either as a replacement for a sinus x ray or as a followup to an abnormal sinus radiograph. The sensitivity of
CT allows for location of areas of sinus infection,
particularly chronic infection. CT scans can show the
extent and location of tiny fractures to the sinus and
nasal bones. Foreign bodies in the sinus and nasal area
are also easily detected by CT. CT imaging of the
sinuses is important in evaluating trauma or disease
of the sphenoid bone (the wedge shaped bone at the
base of the skull). Sinus tumors will show as shades of
gray indicating the difference in their density from that
of normal tissues in the area.

Metastasis—Secondary cancer, or cancer that has
spread from one body organ or tissue to another.
Radiologist—A medical doctor specially trained in
radiology (x ray) interpretation and its use in the
diagnosis of disease and injury.
Spiral CT—Also referred to as helical CT, this
method allows for continuous 360-degree x-ray
image capture.
Thoracic—Refers to the chest area. The thorax runs
between the abdomen and neck and is encased in
the ribs.

Brain studies
The precise differences in density allowed by CT
scan can clearly show tumors, strokes, or lesions in the
brain area as altered densities. These lighter or darker
areas on the image may indicate a tumor or hematoma
within the brain and skull area. Different types of
tumors can be identified by the presence of edema, by
the tissue’s density, or by studying blood vessel location and activity. The speed and convenience of CT
often allows for detection of hemorrhage before symptoms even occur. Congenital abnormalities in children, such as hydrocephalus, may also be confirmed
with CT. Hydrocephalus is suggested by enlargement
of the fluid structures called ventricles of the brain.
Body scans
The body scan can identify abnormal body structures and organs. Throughout the body, a CT may
indicate tumors or cysts, enlarged lymph nodes,
964

abnormal collections of fluids, blood or fat, and
metastasis of cancer. Tumors resulting from metastasis are different in makeup than primary tumors, or
those that originate in the location of study. Fractures
or damage to soft tissues and ligaments will be more
easily seen on the sensitive images produced by CT
scanning, though CT is not usually done for these.
Liver conditions, such as cirrhosis or abscessed or
fatty liver, may be observed on the body scan.
CT of the aorta
CT provides the ability to see and measure the
thickness of the aortal wall, which is very helpful in
diagnosing aortic aneurysms. The use of contrast will
help see details within the aorta. In addition, density
can identify calcification, and this helps differentiate
between acute and chronic problems. An abnormal
CT scan may indicate signs of aortic clots. Aortic
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Chest scans
In addition to those findings that may indicate
aortic aneurysms, chest CT studies can show other
problems in the heart and lungs, and distinguish
between an aortic aneurysm and a tumor adjacent to
the aorta. The computer will not only show differences
between air, water, tissues, and bone, but will also
assign numerical values to the various densities.
Coin-sized lesions in the lungs may be indicative of
tuberculosis or tumors. CT will help distinguish among
the two. Enlarged lymph nodes in the chest area may
indicate Hodgkin’s disease. Spiral CT is particularly
effective at identifying pulmonary emboli (clots in the
lung’s blood vessels).

I Concussion
Definition
Concussion is a trauma-induced change in mental
status, with confusion and amnesia, and with or without a brief loss of consciousness.

Description
A concussion occurs when the head hits or is hit
by an object, or when the brain is jarred against the
skull, with sufficient force to cause temporary loss of
function in the higher centers of the brain. The
injured person may remain conscious or lose consciousness briefly, and is disoriented for some minutes after the blow. According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, approximately
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

300,000 people sustain mild to moderate sportsrelated brain injuries each year, most of them young
men between 16 and 25.
While concussion usually resolves on its own
without lasting effect, it can set the stage for a much
more serious condition. ‘‘Second impact syndrome’’
occurs when a person with a concussion, even a very
mild one, suffers a second blow before fully recovering
from the first. The brain swelling and increased intracranial pressure that can result is potentially fatal.
More than 20 such cases have been reported since the
syndrome was first described in 1984.

Causes and symptoms
Causes
Most concussions are caused by motor vehicle
accidents and sports injuries. In motor vehicle accidents, concussion can occur without an actual blow
to the head. Instead, concussion occurs because the
skull suddenly decelerates or stops, which causes
the brain to be jarred against the skull. Contact
sports, especially football, hockey, and boxing, are
among those most likely to lead to concussion.
Other significant causes include falls, collisions, or
blows due to bicycling, horseback riding, skiing, and
soccer.
The risk of concussion from football is extremely
high, especially at the high school level. Studies show
that approximately one in five players suffer concussion or more serious brain injury during their brief
high-school careers. The rate at the collegiate level is
approximately one in 20. Rates for hockey players
are not known as certainly, but are believed to be
similar.
Concussion and lasting brain damage is an especially significant risk for boxers, since the goal of the
sport is, in fact, to deliver a concussion to the opponent. For this reason, the American Academy of
Neurology has called for a ban on boxing. Repeated
concussions over months or years can cause cumulative head injury. The cumulative brain injuries suffered
by most boxers can lead to permanent brain damage.
Multiple blows to the head can cause ‘‘punch-drunk’’
syndrome or dementia pugilistica, as evidenced by
Muhammaed Ali, whose parkinsonism is a result of
his career in the ring.
Young children are likely to suffer concussions
from falls or collisions on the playground or around
the home. Child abuse is, unfortunately, another common cause of concussion.

Concussion

Symptoms
Symptoms of concussion include:


headache



disorientation as to time, date, or place



confusion



dizziness



vacant stare or confused expression



incoherent or incomprehensible speech



incoordination or weakness



amnesia for the events immediately preceding the
blow



nausea or vomiting



double vision



ringing in the ears

These symptoms may last from several minutes to
several hours. More severe or longer-lasting symptoms may indicate more severe brain injury. The person with a concussion may or may not lose
consciousness from the blow; if so, it will be for several
minutes at the most. More prolonged unconsciousness
indicates more severe brain injury.
The severity of concussion is graded on a threepoint scale, used as a basis for treatment decisions.


Grade 1: no loss of consciousness, transient confusion, and other symptoms that resolve within
15 minutes.



Grade 2: no loss of consciousness, transient confusion, and other symptoms that require more than
15 minutes to resolve.



Grade 3: loss of consciousness for any period.

Days or weeks after the accident, the person may
show signs of:


headache



poor attention and concentration



memory difficulties



anxiety



depression



sleep disturbances



light and noise intolerance

The occurrence of such symptoms is called ‘‘postconcussion syndrome.’’
966

Diagnosis
It is very important for those attending a person
with concussion to pay close attention to the person’s
symptoms and progression immediately after the accident. The duration of unconsciousness and degree of
confusion are very important indicators of the severity
of the injury and help guide the diagnostic process and
treatment decisions.
A doctor, nurse, or emergency medical technician
may make an immediate assessment based on the
severity of the symptoms; a neurologic exam of the
pupils, coordination, and sensation; and brief tests of
orientation, memory, and concentration. Those with
very mild concussions may not need to be hospitalized
or have expensive diagnostic tests. Questionable or
more severe cases may require computed tomography
scan (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
to look for brain injury.

Treatment
The symptoms of concussion usually clear quickly
and without lasting effect, if no further injury is sustained during the healing process. Guidelines for
returning to sports activities are based on the severity
of the concussion.
A grade 1 concussion can usually be treated with
rest and continued observation alone. The person may
return to sports activities that same day, but only after
examination by a trained professional, and after all
symptoms have completely resolved. If the person
sustains a second concussion of any severity that
same day, he or she should not be allowed to continue
contact sports until he or she has been symptom-free,
during both rest and activity, for one week.
A person with a grade 2 concussion must discontinue sports activity for the day, should be evaluated
by a trained professional, and should be observed
closely throughout the day to make sure that all symptoms have completely cleared. Worsening of symptoms, or continuation of any symptoms beyond one
week, indicates the need for a CT or MRI scan. Return
to contact sports should only occur after one week
with no symptoms, both at rest and during activity,
and following examination by a physician. Following
a second grade 2 concussion, the person should remain
symptom-free for two weeks before resuming contact
sports.
A person with a grade 3 concussion (involving any
loss of consciousness, no matter how brief) should be
examined by a medical professional either on the scene
or in an emergency room. More severe symptoms may

warrant a CT or MRI scan, along with a thorough
neurological and physical exam. The person should be
hospitalized if any abnormalities are found or if confusion persists. Prolonged unconsciousness and worsening symptoms require urgent neurosurgical
evaluation or transfer to a trauma center. Following
discharge from professional care, the patient is closely
monitored for neurological symptoms which may
arise or worsen. If headaches or other symptoms worsen or last longer than one week, a CT or MRI scan
should be performed. Contact sports are avoided for
one week following unconsciousness of only seconds,
and for two weeks for unconsciousness of a minute or
more. A person receiving a second grade 3 concussion
should avoid contact sports for at least a month after
all symptoms have cleared, and then only with the
approval of a physician. If signs of brain swelling or
bleeding are seen on a CT or MRI scan, the athlete
should not return to the sport for the rest of the
season, or even indefinitely.
For someone who has sustained a concussion of
any severity, it is critically important that he or she
avoid the possibility of another blow to the head until
well after all symptoms have cleared to prevent second-impact syndrome. The guidelines above are
designed to minimize the risk of this syndrome.

Prognosis
Concussion usually leaves no lasting neurological
problems. Nonetheless, symptoms of post-concussion
syndrome may last for weeks or even months.
Studies of concussion in contact sports have
shown that the risk of sustaining a second concussion
is even greater than it was for the first if the person
continues to engage in the sport.

Prevention
Many cases of concussion can be prevented by
using appropriate protective equipment. This includes
seat belts and air bags in automobiles, and helmets in
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

all contact sports. Helmets should also be worn when
bicycling, skiing, or horseback riding. Soccer players
should avoid heading the ball when it is kicked at high
velocity from close range. Playground equipment
should be underlaid with soft material, either sand or
special matting.
The value of high-contact sports such as boxing,
football, or hockey should be weighed against the high
risk of brain injury during a young person’s participation in the sport. Steering a child’s general enthusiasm
for sports into activities less apt to produce head
impacts may reduce the likelihood of brain injury.

I Condom
Definition
Male condoms are thin sheaths of latex (rubber),
polyurethane (plastic), or animal tissue that are rolled
onto an erect penis immediately prior to intercourse.
They are commonly called ‘‘safes’’ or ‘‘rubbers.’’
Female condoms are made of polyurethane and are
inserted into the vaginal canal before sexual relations.
The open end covers the outside of the vagina, and the
closed ring fits over the cervix (opening into the
uterus). Both types of condoms collect the male
semen at ejaculation, acting as a barrier to fertilization. Condoms also perform as barriers to the
exchange of bodily fluids and are subsequently an
important tool in the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

Purpose
Both male and female condoms are used to prevent pregnancy and to protect against STDs such as
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), gonorrhea,
chlamydia, and syphilis. To accomplish these goals,
the condom must be applied and removed correctly.

Precautions
Male and female condoms should not be used
together as there is a risk that one of them may come
off. The male condom should not be snug on the tip of
the penis. A space of about 0.5 in should be left at the
end to avoid the possibility of it breaking during sexual intercourse. The penis must be withdrawn quickly
after ejaculation to prevent the condom from falling
off as the penis softens. The condom should therefore
always be removed while the penis is still erect to
prevent the sperm from spilling into the vagina.

Penis

Description
Male condoms made from animal tissue and linen
have been in use for centuries. Latex condoms were
introduced in the late 1800s and gained immediate
popularity because they were inexpensive and effective. At that time, they were primarily used to protect
against STDs. A common complaint made by many
consumers is that condoms reduce penis sensitivity
and impair orgasm. Both men and women may
develop allergies to the latex. Consumer interest in
female condoms has been slight.
Male condoms may be purchased lubricated,
ribbed, or treated with spermicide (a chemical that
kills sperm). To be effective, condoms must be
removed carefully so as not to ‘‘spill’’ the contents
into the vaginal canal. Condoms that leak or break
do not provide protection against pregnancy or
disease.
If used correctly, male condoms have an effectiveness rate of about 90% for preventing pregnancy, but
this rate can be increased to about 99% if used with a
spermicide. (Several types of spermicides are available;
they can be purchased in the form of contraceptive
creams and jellies, foams, or films.) Benefits associated
with this type of contraceptive device include easy
availability (no prescription is required), convenience
of use, and lack of serious side effects. The primary
disadvantage is that sexual activity must be interrupted in order to put the condom on.
Female condoms, when used correctly and at
every instance of intercourse, were shown to prevent
pregnancy in over 95% of women surveyed over the
course of six months. When used inconsistently, the
female condom was shown to have a failure rate of
21% in the same study. One benefit of the female
condom is that it may be inserted immediately before
sexual intercourse or up to eight hours prior, so that
sexual activity does not need to be interrupted for its
insertion. One study performed by a manufacturer of

I Conduct disorder
Definition
Conduct disorder (CD) is a behavioral and emotional disorder of childhood and adolescence.
Children with conduct disorder act inappropriately,
infringe on the rights of others, and violate the behavioral expectations of others.

Description
CD is present in approximately 9% of boys and
2–9% of girls under the age of 18. Children with conduct disorder act out aggressively and express anger
inappropriately. They engage in a variety of antisocial
and destructive acts, including violence towards people and animals, destruction of property, lying,
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Difficulty in school is an early sign of potential
conduct disorder problems. While the patient’s IQ
tends to be in the normal range, they can have trouble
with verbal and abstract reasoning skills and may lag
behind their classmates, and consequently, feel as if
they don’t ‘‘fit in.’’ The frustration and loss of selfesteem resulting from this academic and social inadequacy can trigger the development of CD.
A dysfunctional home environment can be
another major contributor to CD. An emotionally,
physically, or sexually abusive home environment, a
family history of antisocial personality disorder, or
parental substance abuse can damage a child’s perceptions of himself and put him on a path toward negative
behavior. Other less obvious environmental factors
can also play a part in the development of conduct
disorder. Long-term studies have shown that maternal
smoking during pregnancy may be linked to the development of CD in boys. Animal and human studies
point out that nicotine can have undesirable effects
on babies. These include altered structure and function of their nervous systems, learning deficits, and
behavioral problems. In a study of 177 boys ages
seven to 12 years, those with mothers who smoked
over one-half a package of cigarettes daily while pregnant were more apt to have a CD than those with
mothers who did not smoke.
Other conditions that may cause or co-exist with
CD include head injury, substance abuse disorder,
major depressive disorder, and attention deficit

HIV-positive partner, all but two individuals were
protected against HIV transmission with condom
use. In addition to HIV, condoms provide effective

human papillomavirus (HPV), and herpes simplex
virus (HSV).

Conduct disorder

hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Thirty to fifty percent
of children diagnosed with ADHD, a disorder characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or
hyperactivity, also have CD.
CD is defined as a repetitive behavioral pattern of
violating the rights of others or societal norms. Three
of the following criteria, or symptoms, are required
over the previous 12 months for a diagnosis of CD
(one of the three must have occurred in the past six
months):


bullies, threatens, or intimidates others



picks fights



has used a dangerous weapon



has been physically cruel to people



has been physically cruel to animals



has stolen while confronting a victim (for example,
mugging or extortion)



has forced someone into sexual activity



has deliberately set a fire with the intention of
causing damage



has deliberately destroyed property of others



has broken into someone else’s house or car



frequently lies to get something or to avoid
obligations



has stolen without confronting a victim or breaking
and entering (e.g., shoplifting or forgery)



stays out at night; breaks curfew (beginning before
13 years of age)



has run away from home overnight at least twice (or
once for a lengthy period)



is often truant from school (beginning before
13 years of age)

Diagnosis
CD is diagnosed and treated by a number of social
workers, school counselors, psychiatrists, and psychologists. Genuine diagnosis may require psychiatric
expertise to rule out such conditions as bipolar disorder
or ADHD. A comprehensive evaluation of the child
should ideally include interviews with the child and
parents, a full social and medical history, a cognitive
evaluation, and a psychiatric exam. One or more clinical inventories or scales may be used to assess the
child for conduct disorder—including the Youth
Self-Report, the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS),
Behavioral Assessment System for Children (BASC),
Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and Diagnostic

despair.

Interview Schedule for Children (DISC). The tests
are verbal and/or written and are administered in
both hospital and outpatient settings.

Treatment
Treating conduct disorder requires an approach
that addresses both the child and his environment.
Behavioral therapy and psychotherapy can help a
child with CD to control his anger and develop new
coping skills. Family group therapy may also be effective in some cases. Parents should be counseled on how
to set appropriate limits with their child and be consistent and realistic when disciplining. If an abusive
home life is at the root of the conduct problem, every
effort should be made to move the child into a more
supportive environment. Parent training programs are
increasing in number.
For children with coexisting ADHD, substance
abuse, depression, or learning disorders, treating
these conditions first is preferred, and may result in a
significant improvement to the CD condition. In all
cases of CD, treatment should begin when symptoms
first appear. Recent studies have shown Ritalin to be a
useful drug for both ADHD and CD.
When aggressive behavior is severe, mood stabilizing medication, including lithium (Cibalith-S,
Eskalith, Lithane, Lithobid, Lithonate, Lithotabs),
carbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol), and propranolol
(Inderal), may be an appropriate option for treating
the aggressive symptoms. However, placing the child
into a structured setting or treatment program such as
a psychiatric hospital may be just as beneficial for
easing aggression as medication.

Prognosis
The prognosis for children with CD is not bright.
Follow-up studies of conduct disordered children have
shown a high incidence of antisocial personality
disorder, affective illnesses, and chronic criminal
GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE

Prevention
A supportive, nurturing, and structured home
environment is believed to be the best defense against
CD. Children with learning disabilities and/or difficulties in school should get immediate and appropriate
academic assistance. Addressing these problems when
they first appear helps to prevent the frustration and
low self-esteem that may lead to CD later on.
