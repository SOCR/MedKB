# Schema Expansion Summary

## 🎯 Problem Identified

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- **Primary Issue:** Missing 7 critical node types in schema
- **Secondary Issue:** AWS confidence threshold too high (0.75 vs. 0.72 for "Diabetes")
- **Impact:** Both LM Studio and Claude forced entities into wrong categories when correct types weren't available

---

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### **1. Lowered AWS Confidence Threshold**
- **Before:** `MIN_CONFIDENCE_SCORE = 0.75`
- **After:** `MIN_CONFIDENCE_SCORE = 0.70`
- **Impact:** "Diabetes" (0.72 confidence) will now be captured

---

### **2. Added 7 New Node Types**

#### **Technology & Systems (3 types):**
```python
"Technology"          # AI, ML, computational methods
"Healthcare_System"   # Hospitals, emergency departments, health units
"Health_Policy"       # Government regulations, care policies
```

#### **Social & Demographic (4 types):**
```python
"Demographic_Factor"  # Gender, race, ethnicity
"Social_Program"      # Welfare programs, family allowance, Medicare
"Social_Determinant"  # Socioeconomic factors (poverty, education)
"Geographic_Location" # Cities, regions, urban/rural areas
```

**Total Node Types:** 20 → **27**

---

### **3. Added 6 New Relationship Types**

#### **Technology & System Relationships:**
```python
"UTILIZES"      # Study/system uses technology (e.g., Study-[:UTILIZES]->Machine_Learning)
"PROVIDED_BY"   # Service provided by institution (e.g., Emergency_Care-[:PROVIDED_BY]->Hospital)
"REGULATED_BY"  # Entity governed by policy (e.g., Healthcare-[:REGULATED_BY]->Policy)
```

#### **Social & Demographic Relationships:**
```python
"ELIGIBLE_FOR"  # Demographics qualify for programs (e.g., Elderly-[:ELIGIBLE_FOR]->Medicare)
"INFLUENCED_BY" # Outcome affected by determinant (e.g., Diabetes-[:INFLUENCED_BY]->Poverty)
"LOCATED_IN"    # Entity in geographic location (e.g., Hospital-[:LOCATED_IN]->Urban_Area)
```

**Total Relationship Types:** 20 → **26**

---

### **4. Added AWS Comprehend Templates**

Added clinical sentence templates for all 7 new node types to improve AWS standardization:

```python
"Technology": "Healthcare utilizes {name} technology."
"Healthcare_System": "Patient received care at {name} facility."
"Health_Policy": "Healthcare governed by {name} policy."
"Demographic_Factor": "Patient demographics: {name}."
"Social_Program": "Patient enrolled in {name} program."
"Social_Determinant": "Patient affected by {name} factor."
"Geographic_Location": "Patient resides in {name} area."
```

---

### **5. Added Entity Type → API Mapping**

All 7 new types mapped to SNOMED API (will fallback to BIOGRAPH if not found).

---

## 📊 Expected Improvements

### **Before Schema Expansion:**

| Entity | LM Studio Classification | Claude Classification | Problem |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|---------|
| Artificial Intelligence | Clinical_Study ❌ | Treatment ❌ | Wrong type |
| Machine Learning | Biological_Process ❌ | Diagnostic_Procedure ❌ | Wrong type |
| Emergency Services | Clinical_Study ❌ | Treatment ❌ | Wrong type |
| Female Gender | Lifestyle_Factor ❌ | Lifestyle_Factor ❌ | Wrong type |
| Diabetes | BIOGRAPH (no match) ❌ | BIOGRAPH (no match) ❌ | Below threshold |

### **After Schema Expansion:**

| Entity | Expected Classification | AWS Match | Outcome |
|--------|------------------------|-----------|---------|
| Artificial Intelligence | Technology ✅ | BIOGRAPH | Correct type |
| Machine Learning | Technology ✅ | BIOGRAPH | Correct type |
| Emergency Services | Healthcare_System ✅ | BIOGRAPH | Correct type |
| Female Gender | Demographic_Factor ✅ | SNOMED (possible) | Correct type |
| Diabetes | Disease ✅ | SNOMEDCT:73211009 ✅ | Now captured! |

## 🧪 Next Steps

### **Test the Changes:**

```bash
# Test with LM Studio (faster)
python run_pipeline.py --use-lm-studio --test-mode

# Compare with Claude baseline
python run_pipeline.py --test-mode
```

### **What to Look For:**

1. ✅ **"Diabetes"** should now show:
   ```
   ✅ Diabetes → SNOMEDCT:73211009 (primary snomed, conf: 0.72)
   ```

2. ✅ **"Machine Learning"** should now show:
   ```
   ⚠️  Machine Learning → BIOGRAPH:TECHNOLOGY:7c4e01ae912e (no AWS match)
   ```
   (Note: `TECHNOLOGY` instead of `BIOLOGICAL_PROCESS` or `CLINICAL_STUDY`)

3. ✅ **"Emergency Department"** should now show:
   ```
   ⚠️  Emergency Department → BIOGRAPH:HEALTHCARE_SYSTEM:abc123 (no AWS match)
   ```

4. ✅ **"Female"** should now show:
   ```
   ⚠️  Female → BIOGRAPH:DEMOGRAPHIC_FACTOR:206480830ed5 (no AWS match)
   ```
   (Note: `DEMOGRAPHIC_FACTOR` instead of `LIFESTYLE_FACTOR`)

---

## 🎯 Impact Summary

### **Accuracy Improvements:**
- ✅ Correct entity types for 7 new categories
- ✅ "Diabetes" now standardized to SNOMED
- ✅ LLM has clearer guidance on classification

### **Knowledge Graph Quality:**
- ✅ More precise relationships (e.g., `UTILIZES` vs. generic `ASSOCIATED_WITH`)
- ✅ Better semantic grouping of nodes by type
- ✅ Improved RAG retrieval for social determinants of health

### **PMC Data Compatibility:**
- ✅ Better handling of research methodology mentions (AI/ML)
- ✅ Proper classification of healthcare systems and policies
- ✅ Accurate demographic and social factor tracking

## 📝 BIOGRAPH ID Generation (Answered)

**Question:** How is the unique ID generated for BIOGRAPH entities?

**Answer:**
```python
def generate_fallback_id(entity_name: str, entity_type: str) -> str:
    normalized_name = re.sub(r'[^a-z0-9]', '', entity_name.lower())
    hashed_id = hashlib.sha1(normalized_name.encode()).hexdigest()[:12]
    return f"BIOGRAPH:{entity_type.upper()}:{hashed_id}"
```

**Example:**
- Input: `"Multimorbidity"`, type: `"Pathological_Finding"`
- Normalized: `"multimorbidity"`
- SHA-1 Hash: `"1a4bcf2548f1..."` (first 12 chars)
- Output: `BIOGRAPH:PATHOLOGICAL_FINDING:1a4bcf2548f1`

**Properties:**
- ✅ **Deterministic:** Same name → same ID every time
- ✅ **Collision-resistant:** SHA-1 ensures uniqueness
- ✅ **Reproducible:** Consistent across documents and runs

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

Run the pipeline again and compare the results. The schema is now **38% larger** (20→27 node types) and should eliminate most misclassifications!
